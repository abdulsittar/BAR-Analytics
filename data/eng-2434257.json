Tobin / Sept. 9, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe consensus coming out of Wednesday night's forum on security issues hosted by NBC is that Donald Trump profited the most from the event. Considering that Trump produced his usual quota of questionable and outrageous statements, that's a debatable conclusion. But what isn't in dispute is that the evening's loser wasn't so much Hillary Clinton as moderator Matt Lauer. The \"Today Show\" host didn't get much love from Trump supporters, but Democrats deplored his performance, accusing him not only of being unprepared but of demonstrating anti-Clinton bias and sexism, as well.\n\nIt's not every day that liberals cry media bias, especially against a pillar of a non-conservative mainstream media institution. But let's admit that Lauer wasn't the best choice for such a forum. He had no more success in holding Trump accountable than did the moderators of any of the Republican debates, including those, like Megyn Kelly, who were tough on him. That's as much of a tribute to the GOP candidate's baffling ability to say false, foolish, and contradictory things with a straight face as the failure of those trying to keep him in check. But Lauer did seem a bit tougher at times on Clinton that he was on Trump. Perhaps that's more a result of his seeing her as a serious candidate and viewing her rival as a circus act. Sexism need not enter the equation.\n\nIn particular, Lauer's unwillingness to challenge Trump on his fallacious claim that he always opposed the Iraq War has prompted an argument about whether debate moderators should be instant fact checkers. Some journalists, like Fox News's Chris Wallace, who will moderate one of the three Clinton-Trump debates, says that isn't their purpose. In response, Democrats say the lack of real-time fact checking gives an unfair advantage to someone like Trump who lies a lot more often than Clinton.\n\nLet's not mistake the gang tackle of Lauer for a truth squad. Most of his detractors were not so much interested in fairness as they were in more Candy Crawley moments.\n\nThe former CNN journalist delighted Democrats in 2012 when she interjected her own opinions into one of the debates between President Obama and Mitt Romney. She corrected Romney when he spoke of the administration's shifting positions on how to characterize the Benghazi attack. This stopped the GOP candidate in his tracks. Liberals forget, however, that what Romney said was actually correct. Crowley was wrong on the facts, and her error created a two-on-one dynamic that was deeply unfair. It played a big part in what was widely considered a blow to Romney's hopes of winning the debate and the election.\n\nThe candidates in this election are both flawed people with records of mendacity. But while Clinton responds to challenges with unpersuasive and lengthy, lawyerly arguments, Trump merely rides roughshod over tough questions and deflects the discussion away from his misstatements. That's why he often seems to \"win\" debates that he lost on the merits. Debate moderators should be tough on both candidates and, as much as possible, get them to answer questions on their positions and past statements. But no one in that position can entirely even out the playing field between two such disparate personalities. Moreover, when liberals call for a level playing field, what they want is not fairness but bias favoring their candidate.\n\nSome in the liberal mainstream media believe that Trump is so egregious a figure that it does the public no service to maintain a pretense of objectivity in the contest between him and Clinton. Given how often Trump says things that are blatantly false, a decision by the press to stop giving equal time to both candidates may seem reasonable.\n\nBut the operative word here is \"pretense.\" Much of the liberal media's supposed objectivity is a pose no different from Crowley's in 2012. Lauer's willingness to question Clinton closely on her email scandal is what got their goat as much as his failure to take down Trump a peg or two. They may believe her inability to stop lying about that issue is irrelevant when compared to other topics or to Trump's unfitness for high office. But that is up to the voters, not a debate moderator operating as a high priest of journalism conferring legitimacy on one candidate and denying it to another.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Herefiled under:Candy CrowleyMatt Lauerpresidential debates0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:What Liberals Want in DebatesMust-Reads from Magazine Foreign Affairs The Myth of CIA Professionalism Michael Rubin 2016-09-09 Michael Rubin / Sept. 9, 2016 1Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nDonald Trump's throwaway line, during the September 7 national-security forum, about his intelligence briefers allegedly criticizing President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has intelligence professionals taking umbrage. According to a write-up in the Washington Post:\n\nDid U.S. intelligence analysts betray disdain for President Obama and Hillary Clinton during recent classified briefings with Donald Trump, as the GOP candidate claimed Wednesday? Doing so would represent an almost inconceivable violation of training and tradition, former U.S. intelligence officials said. They added, however, that those accused briefers may be quietly muttering and shaking their heads about at least one of the presidential candidates now. \"Those selected for this task would have been the most professional of an elite corps of intelligence officers,\" said Paul Pillar, a former high-ranking CIA analyst. \"One of the last things they would do is express either verbally or through body-language preferences\" about candidates or policy. Michael Morell, a former deputy CIA director who has endorsed Clinton, put it more bluntly, saying that Trump's comments \"show that he's got zero understanding of how intelligence works.\"\n\nWhile Trump's claim should be taken with a grain of salt given his past bluster, empty claims, and penchant for exaggeration, Pillar and Morell are wrong as well. They are describing an idealized world where intelligence professionals respect and obey the line between their jobs and partisans politics, but that line has blurred significantly over the past decades. Almost 15 years ago, Abe Shulsky and Gary Schmitt published Silent Warfare, an excellent overview of many of the structural issues and analytical problems with which the intelligence community grapples. How, for example, can personal bias be completely purged from analysis when personal judgment still determines what is and is not included or relevant for any analytical product? Likewise, how do intelligence analysts handle frustration when policymakers decide on a policy that analysts feel will worsen a situation? After all, it is the job of the intelligence community to analyze and understand, and many career analysts spend their whole lives focused on a relatively small subset of a problem. Central Intelligence Agency analysts, for example, might focus on the Qods Force or Iran's nuclear program or Iranian politics or Iran's economy, but few if any follow all of those categories together. Therefore, many analysts are like the proverbial blind man describing the elephant by feeling only the trunk, feet, or tail.\n\nNor is intelligence politicization new. Earlier this year, I wrote a lengthy piece for the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, the major intelligence trade journal, analyzing the motives behind a half-century of political manipulation of intelligence.\n\nNow, in my past government service, I sat in on some intelligence briefings, albeit at a lower level and the briefers were uniformly professional. But, at the same time, there has been very public and very blatant politically motivated malfeasance on the part of some intelligence professionals. Remember the leaks criticizing the questions Vice President Dick Cheney asked during intelligence briefings? Someone at the CIA was behind those leaks. Then there was a November 10, 2005 article in the American Progress which quoted former Defense Intelligence Agency official W. Patrick Lang, a vocal opponent of President George W. Bush's Middle East policies, talking about how CIA officials with whom he was friendly openly admitted to leaking intelligence in order to sway the 2004 election:\n\n\"Of course they were leaking,\" says Pat Lang. \"They told me about it at the time. They thought it was funny. They'd say things like, 'This last thing that came out, surely people will pay attention to that. They won't re-elect this man.'\"\n\nMany intelligence analysts are hardworking and professional, but the fact that intelligence analysts have leaked with impunity to play political games is bad enough. That the CIA apparently did nothing to investigate the admission and punish the perpetrators gives ample reason not to trust the professionalism of all analysts or the leadership that gave and perhaps continues to give such leaks a pass. Trump may not be truthful but, let's face it, Morell's idyllic fantasy of CIA professionalism equally strains belief.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

All of Them. Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-09 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 9, 2016 1Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday morning, Gary Johnson earned himself immortality by saying something that will be in every political blooper reel for as long as the media survive. His cringe-inducing blank stare, offered when asked what he would \"do about Aleppo,\" made him the butt of abuse across the political spectrum. Yet he was also subsequently was praised for owning up to his mistake and for coming up with a coherent-sounding answer when probed later about his views on the Syrian civil war.\n\nTo some extent the instinct to show mercy to Johnson is understandable, especially since that gaffe may cost him whatever small chance he might have had to get his polling numbers up to 15 percent and join the first presidential debate. Having the grace to admit your mistakes is a good thing and the choices in this election would seem less grim to most voters if the two major-party candidates could do that. But it's a mistake to let Johnson off the hook. It was no accident that he would demonstrate ignorance on this topic. As a rigid isolationist, neither he nor most of his Libertarian supporters care about what's happening in Syria. After all, he is still undecided about the merits of intervening in World War Two.\n\nYet rather than merely guffaw at Johnson, we also ought to hold the other candidates -- and the incumbent -- accountable for their statements on Syria. They may know what Aleppo is, but they offer no more coherent answers than the clueless Libertarian does about how to handle the greatest humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.\n\nLet's remember that President Obama refused to act in the early months of the Syrian unrest, when it might have been possible to force Bashar Assad out of office in the hope of seeing a non-Islamist replacement government. He subsequently laid down a \"red line\" against Assad's using chemical weapons on his own people and then again refused to act when the Syrian dictator crossed it. Since then he has punted on Syria, partly in order to appease Assad's ally Iran, and he's allowed Russia a free hand to ensure that the Damascus government stays in power. The result is the current disaster in Aleppo, which adds to the suffering in a country where hundreds of thousands have been killed and five million have been driven from their homes.\n\nDonald Trump's main contribution to the discussion about Syria was taking a reasonable position -- a halt to admitting refugees from the country because they couldn't be properly vetted -- and turning it into a policy of religious intolerance: a ban on Muslim travel to the United States. But Trump's embrace of Vladimir Putin and his stated desire for better relations with Russia gives all the bad actors involved a green light for continued atrocities in Syria.\n\nHillary Clinton's position on Syria is supposed to be tougher than that of her former boss since he ignored her pleas for some sort of a stand there while she was secretary of state. But Clinton has been as silent about Syria as the other candidates have. Her pledges never to put U.S. troops on the ground again in the Middle East also undermines any notion that she would be willing to do more than pay lip service to the crisis if she won in November. She can find Aleppo on a map; she understands what's happening; and she can tell us how sad she is about it. But she offers no coherent alternative to the positions of Obama or Trump.\n\nPut in that context, Johnson still deserves his place in the blooper reel, but he isn't much more culpable than the major-party candidates who are counting on the indifference of the American public to save them from having to come up with a policy that might stop the killing.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization.

What Are Dems Worried About? Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 18Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nOn Tuesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made an unusual request of her Republican counterpart. She wrote House Speaker Paul Ryan asking him to prevent Republicans from using any hacked documents in their re-election campaigns. With the publication of Democratic National Committee emails this summer as a result of what the U.S. government believes was a Russian hacking operation and threats of more such revelations from Wikileaks' Julian Assange, cyber security has become a major issue this fall. And given Russian dictator Vladimir Putin's clear preference for his fanboy Donald Trump, Democrats suspect that if there's going to be any October surprise it will emanate from Moscow and be aimed at Hillary Clinton and her party. But while everyone -- except perhaps Trump -- agrees that neither the Russians nor anyone else should be spying on U.S. politicians -- this request raises a couple of interesting questions about both ethics and politics.\n\nSpying on political enemies is despicable, but examples of the major parties using dirty tricks are not exactly rare in our political history. But the question of whether the product of such spying can be a matter of public debate is a very different thing.\n\nIn a court of law, evidence obtained in illegal searches is deemed the \"fruit of a poisoned tree\" and cannot be considered. Political debates, however, aren't and probably shouldn't be so fastidious. What Edward Snowden and Wikileaks and/or their Russian pals are doing to undermine our national security is wrong. But it's not as if the American people were ever going to ignore what these breaches revealed. If the leaks are truthful and are related to policy issues, there is no way to pretend the information is still unknown.\n\nEven when the leaks seem to be a matter of pure political mischief -- such as the publication of DNC emails that revealed the entirely unsurprising information that the staff there were supporting Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders -- it wasn't possible for the Democratic Party to ignore it. That's why Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign. If the Democrats had stuck to the standard Pelosi would impose on the Republicans, Wasserman Schultz would still be running the DNC.\n\nThe emails of Democratic members of Congress and their staffs probably contain lots of juicy gossip and indiscretions that would be embarrassing. The same is true of the Republicans. It would be unfair for the Russians to decide which of the parties gets embarrassed in this way. Perhaps, as the New York Times seems to suggest,Pelosi's goal here is merely to try and link Ryan and the GOP caucus to Putin's hackers.\n\nBut no matter who does the leaking or who loses out as a result of this spying, if the contents of the leaks are related to policy as opposed to private indiscretions, then it is neither reasonable nor ethical for either political party to vow not to use them. Those in office ought to know that they are living, emailing, and tweeting in glass houses and should act accordingly.\n\nWhich is why one has to wonder what exactly it is that Pelosi and the Democrats are worried about. Her going to the trouble of making the request might be motivated by the knowledge that there are some things that could be revealed about her party's activities or plans that would have a serious impact on the election.\n\nLet's reiterate that both Republicans and Democrats ought to be united in their anger and disgust for the activities of those who seek to undermine U.S. security, especially when it pertains to the war against Islamist terror. They should be just as opposed to any leaks that have political implications. But the best and only defense for politicians of every stripe against embarrassing leaks is to not do or write embarrassing things. If they can't remember that, they are taking their own chances and ought not rely on the forbearance of their political opponents to protect them against their own foibles.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 46Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nLast night's preview of the first presidential debate at the military forum held in New York confirmed what many, if not most Americans think about the two leading candidates. In just an hour's worth of gobsmacking political television, both made statements that were disqualifying. Clinton embroidered upon her previous lies about her email scandal and Trump dumped on the U.S. military while giving yet another endorsement to Vladimir Putin. But if voters woke up today scratching their heads about their dismal choice, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, the man even some otherwise sensible people are demanding to have included in the debates, went on television to demonstrate that he is as bad, if not worse, than either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.\n\nThe NBC forum is being perceived in some quarters as a victory for Trump because of the pasting Clinton took from both moderator Matt Lauer and audience members who asked about her email scandal. Liberals think this is all very unfair since it allowed Clinton to spend less time demonstrating that she is more knowledgeable than Trump. But Clinton's continued denials that she knowingly sent classified material on her insecure home server are outrageous. Yet not quite as outrageous as her claim that her server was actually more secure than well-protected systems operated by the government. You can't admit responsibility for what you say was a mistake and in the next breath claim to have done nothing wrong if you want to retain a shred of credibility. Her sense of entitlement about breaking the rules and cavalier attitude toward the truth make for a depressing spectacle. And its because of that combination that Americans don't trust her.\n\nClinton's answers about foreign and security policy -- where she has an advantage over Trump -- weren't much better. Trying to be both a responsible internationalist and an antiwar leftist is an impossible task and Clinton failed miserably. You can't promise to beat ISIS while at the same time vowing never to commit American ground troops to the fight and still sound like you're the serious person you claim to be.\n\nThat Lauer and the audience easily cornered Clinton speaks to her weakness as a politician. That the Today Show host had less success holding Trump accountable for the string of outrageous and false statements that poured forth from his mouth during his half hour speaks to his strength as a media personality. It may also be, as we saw during the Republican primary debates, that the sheer magnitude of his falsehoods is such that it defeats the ability of ordinary people to cope with them.\n\nSuffice it to say that for an American presidential candidate to praise Vladimir Putin and prefer him to our own president is, by itself, disqualifying. The Obama presidency deserves harsh criticism, but anyone who sees the Russian dictator as a role model is simply running for president in the wrong country. That also applies to Trump's trashing of our military, hostility to the presence of women in the armed forces, and clear desire for only those generals who will tell him what he wants to hear. Does anyone really believe he has a \"secret plan\" to defeat ISIS? Even if he does, what are we to make of a man who vows he won't send troops to Iraq or engage in regime change but then says he also intends to steal oil from that country and Libya, a colonial quagmire project that would make George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq look like an act of strategic genius.\n\nThis morning, however, Gary Johnson exceeded Trump and Clinton in the contest to determine which candidate was the most unqualified to be commander-in-chief. On the \"Morning Joe\" program, Mike Barnicle asked Johnson what he would do about the situation in Aleppo. Johnson replied, \"What is Aleppo?\" Barnicle responded, \"You're kidding,\" to which Johnson simply said, \"No,\" with a deer-in-the-headlights look.\n\nLater Johnson issued a statement claiming that he was actually aware of the ongoing human-rights catastrophe in Syria that centers on the siege of Aleppo and apologized for the gaffe. But coming from the same man who claimed at the Libertarian Party convention that he wasn't sure whether U.S. involvement in World War Two was justified, this stunning moment of ignorance ought to eliminate him from consideration for those voters desperate for an alternative to Trump and Clinton.\n\nAmericans will have two more months to hear more from the candidates. But no matter where you stand on the political spectrum, honest observers must admit that within a span of 12 hours, Clinton, Trump, and Johnson have all proved again why none of them should be president.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declared:\"Their infrastructure was crumbling. So we know that they used a revenue from sanctions relief to start investing in infrastructure.\" But that was nothing but speculation, and ignorant speculation at that given the reality of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' stranglehold over the Iranian economy.\n\nSometimes, however, it is the smaller purchases that give irrefutable evidence that Iran's plans for the future include neither peace nor moderation. Hence, this article from an Iranian defense outlet talking about the Islamic Republic's decision to purchase AK-103s from Russia. The article describes the AK-103, compares it to the M-16, and presents several arguments about why it is best suited for the future needs of Iran's military. Among the most intriguing, however, is a citation of conflicts in Iraq and Yemen and the conclusion that the future of Iran's needs lay with a rifle useful in urban warfare and close-quarter fighting.\n\nThis is worrisome. Consider what Iran has recently been up to: It's used militias to supersede formal Iraqi military chain of command; it's been involved both directly and by proxy in Syria, as well as in more recent efforts to destabilize Yemen via Houthi proxies; and it's showing increasing aggression toward Bahrain and threatening Saudi Arabia. Perhaps it's time to put aside diplomatic rhetoric and wishful thinking and to start looking at where Iran sees itself in the future and how it's equipping its soldiers for the next decade.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:AK-103Iran nuclear dealRussia15Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",

                    "body": "Foreign Affairs The Myth of CIA Professionalism Michael Rubin 2016-09-09 Michael Rubin / Sept. 9, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nDonald Trump's throwaway line, during the September 7 national-security forum, about his intelligence briefers allegedly criticizing President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has intelligence professionals taking umbrage. According to a write-up in the Washington Post:\n\nDid U.S. intelligence analysts betray disdain for President Obama and Hillary Clinton during recent classified briefings with Donald Trump, as the GOP candidate claimed Wednesday? Doing so would represent an almost inconceivable violation of training and tradition, former U.S. intelligence officials said. They added, however, that those accused briefers may be quietly muttering and shaking their heads about at least one of the presidential candidates now. \"Those selected for this task would have been the most professional of an elite corps of intelligence officers,\" said Paul Pillar, a former high-ranking CIA analyst. \"One of the last things they would do is express either verbally or through body-language preferences\" about candidates or policy. Michael Morell, a former deputy CIA director who has endorsed Clinton, put it more bluntly, saying that Trump's comments \"show that he's got zero understanding of how intelligence works.\"\n\nWhile Trump's claim should be taken with a grain of salt given his past bluster, empty claims, and penchant for exaggeration, Pillar and Morell are wrong as well. They are describing an idealized world where intelligence professionals respect and obey the line between their jobs and partisans politics, but that line has blurred significantly over the past decades. Almost 15 years ago, Abe Shulsky and Gary Schmitt published Silent Warfare, an excellent overview of many of the structural issues and analytical problems with which the intelligence community grapples. How, for example, can personal bias be completely purged from analysis when personal judgment still determines what is and is not included or relevant for any analytical product? Likewise, how do intelligence analysts handle frustration when policymakers decide on a policy that analysts feel will worsen a situation? After all, it is the job of the intelligence community to analyze and understand, and many career analysts spend their whole lives focused on a relatively small subset of a problem. Central Intelligence Agency analysts, for example, might focus on the Qods Force or Iran's nuclear program or Iranian politics or Iran's economy, but few if any follow all of those categories together. Therefore, many analysts are like the proverbial blind man describing the elephant by feeling only the trunk, feet, or tail.\n\nNor is intelligence politicization new. Earlier this year, I wrote a lengthy piece for the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, the major intelligence trade journal, analyzing the motives behind a half-century of political manipulation of intelligence.\n\nNow, in my past government service, I sat in on some intelligence briefings, albeit at a lower level and the briefers were uniformly professional. But, at the same time, there has been very public and very blatant politically motivated malfeasance on the part of some intelligence professionals. Remember the leaks criticizing the questions Vice President Dick Cheney asked during intelligence briefings? Someone at the CIA was behind those leaks. Then there was a November 10, 2005 article in the American Progress which quoted former Defense Intelligence Agency official W. Patrick Lang, a vocal opponent of President George W. Bush's Middle East policies, talking about how CIA officials with whom he was friendly openly admitted to leaking intelligence in order to sway the 2004 election:\n\n\"Of course they were leaking,\" says Pat Lang. \"They told me about it at the time. They thought it was funny. They'd say things like, 'This last thing that came out, surely people will pay attention to that. They won't re-elect this man.'\"\n\nMany intelligence analysts are hardworking and professional, but the fact that intelligence analysts have leaked with impunity to play political games is bad enough. That the CIA apparently did nothing to investigate the admission and punish the perpetrators gives ample reason not to trust the professionalism of all analysts or the leadership that gave and perhaps continues to give such leaks a pass. Trump may not be truthful but, let's face it, Morell's idyllic fantasy of CIA professionalism equally strains belief.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

All of Them. Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-09 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 9, 2016 1Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday morning, Gary Johnson earned himself immortality by saying something that will be in every political blooper reel for as long as the media survive. His cringe-inducing blank stare, offered when asked what he would \"do about Aleppo,\" made him the butt of abuse across the political spectrum. Yet he was also subsequently was praised for owning up to his mistake and for coming up with a coherent-sounding answer when probed later about his views on the Syrian civil war.\n\nTo some extent the instinct to show mercy to Johnson is understandable, especially since that gaffe may cost him whatever small chance he might have had to get his polling numbers up to 15 percent and join the first presidential debate. Having the grace to admit your mistakes is a good thing and the choices in this election would seem less grim to most voters if the two major-party candidates could do that. But it's a mistake to let Johnson off the hook. It was no accident that he would demonstrate ignorance on this topic. As a rigid isolationist, neither he nor most of his Libertarian supporters care about what's happening in Syria. After all, he is still undecided about the merits of intervening in World War Two.\n\nYet rather than merely guffaw at Johnson, we also ought to hold the other candidates -- and the incumbent -- accountable for their statements on Syria. They may know what Aleppo is, but they offer no more coherent answers than the clueless Libertarian does about how to handle the greatest humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.\n\nLet's remember that President Obama refused to act in the early months of the Syrian unrest, when it might have been possible to force Bashar Assad out of office in the hope of seeing a non-Islamist replacement government. He subsequently laid down a \"red line\" against Assad's using chemical weapons on his own people and then again refused to act when the Syrian dictator crossed it. Since then he has punted on Syria, partly in order to appease Assad's ally Iran, and he's allowed Russia a free hand to ensure that the Damascus government stays in power. The result is the current disaster in Aleppo, which adds to the suffering in a country where hundreds of thousands have been killed and five million have been driven from their homes.\n\nDonald Trump's main contribution to the discussion about Syria was taking a reasonable position -- a halt to admitting refugees from the country because they couldn't be properly vetted -- and turning it into a policy of religious intolerance: a ban on Muslim travel to the United States. But Trump's embrace of Vladimir Putin and his stated desire for better relations with Russia gives all the bad actors involved a green light for continued atrocities in Syria.\n\nHillary Clinton's position on Syria is supposed to be tougher than that of her former boss since he ignored her pleas for some sort of a stand there while she was secretary of state. But Clinton has been as silent about Syria as the other candidates have. Her pledges never to put U.S. troops on the ground again in the Middle East also undermines any notion that she would be willing to do more than pay lip service to the crisis if she won in November. She can find Aleppo on a map; she understands what's happening; and she can tell us how sad she is about it. But she offers no coherent alternative to the positions of Obama or Trump.\n\nPut in that context, Johnson still deserves his place in the blooper reel, but he isn't much more culpable than the major-party candidates who are counting on the indifference of the American public to save them from having to come up with a policy that might stop the killing.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see.

What Are Dems Worried About? Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 10Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nOn Tuesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made an unusual request of her Republican counterpart. She wrote House Speaker Paul Ryan asking him to prevent Republicans from using any hacked documents in their re-election campaigns. With the publication of Democratic National Committee emails this summer as a result of what the U.S. government believes was a Russian hacking operation and threats of more such revelations from Wikileaks' Julian Assange, cyber security has become a major issue this fall. And given Russian dictator Vladimir Putin's clear preference for his fanboy Donald Trump, Democrats suspect that if there's going to be any October surprise it will emanate from Moscow and be aimed at Hillary Clinton and her party. But while everyone -- except perhaps Trump -- agrees that neither the Russians nor anyone else should be spying on U.S. politicians -- this request raises a couple of interesting questions about both ethics and politics.\n\nSpying on political enemies is despicable, but examples of the major parties using dirty tricks are not exactly rare in our political history. But the question of whether the product of such spying can be a matter of public debate is a very different thing.\n\nIn a court of law, evidence obtained in illegal searches is deemed the \"fruit of a poisoned tree\" and cannot be considered. Political debates, however, aren't and probably shouldn't be so fastidious. What Edward Snowden and Wikileaks and/or their Russian pals are doing to undermine our national security is wrong. But it's not as if the American people were ever going to ignore what these breaches revealed. If the leaks are truthful and are related to policy issues, there is no way to pretend the information is still unknown.\n\nEven when the leaks seem to be a matter of pure political mischief -- such as the publication of DNC emails that revealed the entirely unsurprising information that the staff there were supporting Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders -- it wasn't possible for the Democratic Party to ignore it. That's why Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign. If the Democrats had stuck to the standard Pelosi would impose on the Republicans, Wasserman Schultz would still be running the DNC.\n\nThe emails of Democratic members of Congress and their staffs probably contain lots of juicy gossip and indiscretions that would be embarrassing. The same is true of the Republicans. It would be unfair for the Russians to decide which of the parties gets embarrassed in this way. Perhaps, as the New York Times seems to suggest,Pelosi's goal here is merely to try and link Ryan and the GOP caucus to Putin's hackers.\n\nBut no matter who does the leaking or who loses out as a result of this spying, if the contents of the leaks are related to policy as opposed to private indiscretions, then it is neither reasonable nor ethical for either political party to vow not to use them. Those in office ought to know that they are living, emailing, and tweeting in glass houses and should act accordingly.\n\nWhich is why one has to wonder what exactly it is that Pelosi and the Democrats are worried about. Her going to the trouble of making the request might be motivated by the knowledge that there are some things that could be revealed about her party's activities or plans that would have a serious impact on the election.\n\nLet's reiterate that both Republicans and Democrats ought to be united in their anger and disgust for the activities of those who seek to undermine U.S. security, especially when it pertains to the war against Islamist terror. They should be just as opposed to any leaks that have political implications. But the best and only defense for politicians of every stripe against embarrassing leaks is to not do or write embarrassing things. If they can't remember that, they are taking their own chances and ought not rely on the forbearance of their political opponents to protect them against their own foibles.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 43Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nLast night's preview of the first presidential debate at the military forum held in New York confirmed what many, if not most Americans think about the two leading candidates. In just an hour's worth of gobsmacking political television, both made statements that were disqualifying. Clinton embroidered upon her previous lies about her email scandal and Trump dumped on the U.S. military while giving yet another endorsement to Vladimir Putin. But if voters woke up today scratching their heads about their dismal choice, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, the man even some otherwise sensible people are demanding to have included in the debates, went on television to demonstrate that he is as bad, if not worse, than either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.\n\nThe NBC forum is being perceived in some quarters as a victory for Trump because of the pasting Clinton took from both moderator Matt Lauer and audience members who asked about her email scandal. Liberals think this is all very unfair since it allowed Clinton to spend less time demonstrating that she is more knowledgeable than Trump. But Clinton's continued denials that she knowingly sent classified material on her insecure home server are outrageous. Yet not quite as outrageous as her claim that her server was actually more secure than well-protected systems operated by the government. You can't admit responsibility for what you say was a mistake and in the next breath claim to have done nothing wrong if you want to retain a shred of credibility. Her sense of entitlement about breaking the rules and cavalier attitude toward the truth make for a depressing spectacle. And its because of that combination that Americans don't trust her.\n\nClinton's answers about foreign and security policy -- where she has an advantage over Trump -- weren't much better. Trying to be both a responsible internationalist and an antiwar leftist is an impossible task and Clinton failed miserably. You can't promise to beat ISIS while at the same time vowing never to commit American ground troops to the fight and still sound like you're the serious person you claim to be.\n\nThat Lauer and the audience easily cornered Clinton speaks to her weakness as a politician. That the Today Show host had less success holding Trump accountable for the string of outrageous and false statements that poured forth from his mouth during his half hour speaks to his strength as a media personality. It may also be, as we saw during the Republican primary debates, that the sheer magnitude of his falsehoods is such that it defeats the ability of ordinary people to cope with them.\n\nSuffice it to say that for an American presidential candidate to praise Vladimir Putin and prefer him to our own president is, by itself, disqualifying. The Obama presidency deserves harsh criticism, but anyone who sees the Russian dictator as a role model is simply running for president in the wrong country. That also applies to Trump's trashing of our military, hostility to the presence of women in the armed forces, and clear desire for only those generals who will tell him what he wants to hear. Does anyone really believe he has a \"secret plan\" to defeat ISIS? Even if he does, what are we to make of a man who vows he won't send troops to Iraq or engage in regime change but then says he also intends to steal oil from that country and Libya, a colonial quagmire project that would make George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq look like an act of strategic genius.\n\nThis morning, however, Gary Johnson exceeded Trump and Clinton in the contest to determine which candidate was the most unqualified to be commander-in-chief. On the \"Morning Joe\" program, Mike Barnicle asked Johnson what he would do about the situation in Aleppo. Johnson replied, \"What is Aleppo?\" Barnicle responded, \"You're kidding,\" to which Johnson simply said, \"No,\" with a deer-in-the-headlights look.\n\nLater Johnson issued a statement claiming that he was actually aware of the ongoing human-rights catastrophe in Syria that centers on the siege of Aleppo and apologized for the gaffe. But coming from the same man who claimed at the Libertarian Party convention that he wasn't sure whether U.S. involvement in World War Two was justified, this stunning moment of ignorance ought to eliminate him from consideration for those voters desperate for an alternative to Trump and Clinton.\n\nAmericans will have two more months to hear more from the candidates. But no matter where you stand on the political spectrum, honest observers must admit that within a span of 12 hours, Clinton, Trump, and Johnson have all proved again why none of them should be president.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declared:\"Their infrastructure was crumbling. So we know that they used a revenue from sanctions relief to start investing in infrastructure.\" But that was nothing but speculation, and ignorant speculation at that given the reality of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' stranglehold over the Iranian economy.\n\nSometimes, however, it is the smaller purchases that give irrefutable evidence that Iran's plans for the future include neither peace nor moderation. Hence, this article from an Iranian defense outlet talking about the Islamic Republic's decision to purchase AK-103s from Russia. The article describes the AK-103, compares it to the M-16, and presents several arguments about why it is best suited for the future needs of Iran's military. Among the most intriguing, however, is a citation of conflicts in Iraq and Yemen and the conclusion that the future of Iran's needs lay with a rifle useful in urban warfare and close-quarter fighting.\n\nThis is worrisome. Consider what Iran has recently been up to: It's used militias to supersede formal Iraqi military chain of command; it's been involved both directly and by proxy in Syria, as well as in more recent efforts to destabilize Yemen via Houthi proxies; and it's showing increasing aggression toward Bahrain and threatening Saudi Arabia. Perhaps it's time to put aside diplomatic rhetoric and wishful thinking and to start looking at where Iran sees itself in the future and how it's equipping its soldiers for the next decade.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 15Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nPalestinian Authority officials were crying smear yesterday about the report broadcast on Israel's Channel 1 that PA leader Mahmoud Abbas was a Soviet mole. The information comes from an archive kept by KGB defector Vasily Mitrokhin that is widely considered the most authoritative source on Soviet intelligence operations. But while it is embarrassing for someone who is treated like a world leader to be branded as a one-time spy, does it really matter what he was doing in the 1980s long before he succeeded Yasir Arafat?\n\nFrom the point of diplomacy, the answer is a clear \"no.\" Israel, after all, made deals with Arafat, a terrorist whose hands were soaked in innocent Jewish blood. If Abbas were finally willing to take \"yes\" for an answer, rather than to incite hate and violence, no one in Israel would think twice about his KGB past.\n\nAs to the details about Abbas's work for the KGB, it seems very much in keeping with the state of Palestinian nationalism during the era. Most of the various factions that made up the Palestine Liberation Organization identified with the Soviet bloc and depended heavily on Moscow during the Cold War. Abbas was one of many Palestinian operatives who were educated in Russia, where he wrote a doctoral thesis trying to link Zionism to the Nazis and denying the extent of the Holocaust. That he subsequently did some part-time post-graduate information gathering -- and was, by no small coincidence, run by an intelligence operative named Mikhail Bogdanov who is now fellow former KGB veteran Vladimir Putin's envoy to the Middle East -- as a way of paying off his debt to his hosts was hardly surprising.\n\nIsraelis have known about his Holocaust denial since Abbas first came to prominence after the Oslo Accords as Arafat's top deputy and eventual successor. It's also no secret that Abbas was one of the planners and financiers of the 1972 Olympic Munich massacre. If that didn't stop Israeli governments from not only trying to persuade him to make peace but to actively protect him from Hamas, why does anyone think Israelis would care about him gathering information for the Soviets?\n\nNor does the publicizing of this information give the Israeli government any edge over Abbas in talks about the negotiations (that refuses to restart). If the PA leader were to confound observers and summon up the courage to embrace peace and recognize the legitimacy of a Jewish state no matter its borders, then nothing in his past would prevent him from obtaining extensive concessions from the current Israeli government or any possible successor.\n\nIt's possible that Abbas and his Fatah party are worried that this reminder of his past will give a boost to their Hamas rivals. Hamas was contesting the local elections in the West Bank that were scheduled to be held on Oct. 8 and were just postponed by a PA court. Fatah might worry that Abbas's Soviet ties undermine their efforts to compete with the rulers of Gaza for the title of Palestinian defender of Islam.\n\nApologists for Abbas will likely argue that the Palestinians had no choice but to accept Soviet help during a period when they had few other friends. That's true, but the connection with the anti-Semitic Soviet leadership was always more than an alliance of convenience for men like Arafat and Abbas. Moscow was interested in using the Palestinians to undermine the U.S. and its Israeli ally and didn't care if that meant subsidizing a movement dedicated to terrorist violence against Jews.\n\nBut the rejectionism of the Palestinians wasn't merely a strategy but an expression of their identity. Their national purpose was and still is inextricably linked to their century-old war against the Zionists. If men like Abbas can't rise above their sordid past and make peace, it is not just a matter of habit, but also a natural consequence of the political culture steeped in hate that they have helped create.\n\nBeing a former Soviet agent doesn't prevent Abbas from making peace. But it does supply a partial explanation for why he refuses to do it.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:KGBMahmoud AbbasPalestinian Authority15Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",

Tobin / Sept. 9, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday morning, Gary Johnson earned himself immortality by saying something that will be in every political blooper reel for as long as the media survive. His cringe-inducing blank stare, offered when asked what he would \"do about Aleppo,\" made him the butt of abuse across the political spectrum. Yet he was also subsequently was praised for owning up to his mistake and for coming up with a coherent-sounding answer when probed later about his views on the Syrian civil war.\n\nTo some extent the instinct to show mercy to Johnson is understandable, especially since that gaffe may cost him whatever small chance he might have had to get his polling numbers up to 15 percent and join the first presidential debate. Having the grace to admit your mistakes is a good thing and the choices in this election would seem less grim to most voters if the two major-party candidates could do that. But it's a mistake to let Johnson off the hook. It was no accident that he would demonstrate ignorance on this topic. As a rigid isolationist, neither he nor most of his Libertarian supporters care about what's happening in Syria. After all, he is still undecided about the merits of intervening in World War Two.\n\nYet rather than merely guffaw at Johnson, we also ought to hold the other candidates -- and the incumbent -- accountable for their statements on Syria. They may know what Aleppo is, but they offer no more coherent answers than the clueless Libertarian does about how to handle the greatest humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.\n\nLet's remember that President Obama refused to act in early months of the Syrian unrest, when it might have been possible to force Bashar Assad out of office in the hope of seeing a non-Islamist replacement government. He subsequently laid down a \"red line\" against Assad's using chemical weapons on his own people and then again refused to act when the Syrian dictator crossed it. Since then he has punted on Syria, partly in order to appease Assad's ally Iran and allowed Russia a free hand to ensure that the Damascus government stays in power. The result is the current disaster in Aleppo, which adds to the suffering in a country where hundreds of thousands have been killed and five million have been driven from their homes.\n\nDonald Trump's main contribution to the discussion about Syria was taking a reasonable position -- a halt to admitting refugees from the country because they couldn't be properly vetted -- and turning it into a policy of religious intolerance: a ban on Muslim travel to the United States. But Trump's embrace of Vladimir Putin and his stated desire for better relations with Russia gives all the bad actors involved a green light for continued atrocities in Syria.\n\nHillary Clinton's position on Syria is supposed to be tougher than that of her former boss since he ignored her pleas for some sort of a stand there while she was secretary of state. But Clinton has been as silent about Syria as the other candidates have. Her pledges never to put U.S. troops on the ground again in the Middle East also undermines any notion that she would be willing to do more than pay lip service to the crisis if she won in November. She can find Aleppo on a map; she understands what's happening; and she can tell us how sad she is about it. But she offers no coherent alternative to the positions of Obama or Trump.\n\nPut in that context, Johnson still deserves his place in the blooper reel, but he isn't much more culpable than the major-party candidates who are counting on the indifference of the American public to save them from having to come up with a policy that might stop the killing.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument.

Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 10Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nOn Tuesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made an unusual request of her Republican counterpart. She wrote House Speaker Paul Ryan asking him to prevent Republicans from using any hacked documents in their re-election campaigns. With the publication of Democratic National Committee emails this summer as a result of what the U.S. government believes was a Russian hacking operation and threats of more such revelations from Wikileaks' Julian Assange, cyber security has become a major issue this fall. And given Russian dictator Vladimir Putin's clear preference for his fanboy Donald Trump, Democrats suspect that if there's going to be any October surprise it will emanate from Moscow and be aimed at Hillary Clinton and her party. But while everyone -- except perhaps Trump -- agrees that neither the Russians nor anyone else should be spying on U.S. politicians -- this request raises a couple of interesting questions about both ethics and politics.\n\nSpying on political enemies is despicable, but examples of the major parties using dirty tricks are not exactly rare in our political history. But the question of whether the product of such spying can be a matter of public debate is a very different thing.\n\nIn a court of law, evidence obtained in illegal searches is deemed the \"fruit of a poisoned tree\" and cannot be considered. Political debates, however, aren't and probably shouldn't be so fastidious. What Edward Snowden and Wikileaks and/or their Russian pals are doing to undermine our national security is wrong. But it's not as if the American people were ever going to ignore what these breaches revealed. If the leaks are truthful and are related to policy issues, there is no way to pretend the information is still unknown.\n\nEven when the leaks seem to be a matter of pure political mischief -- such as the publication of DNC emails that revealed the entirely unsurprising information that the staff there were supporting Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders -- it wasn't possible for the Democratic Party to ignore it. That's why Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign. If the Democrats had stuck to the standard Pelosi would impose on the Republicans, Wasserman Schultz would still be running the DNC.\n\nThe emails of Democratic members of Congress and their staffs probably contain lots of juicy gossip and indiscretions that would be embarrassing. The same is true of the Republicans. It would be unfair for the Russians to decide which of the parties gets embarrassed in this way. Perhaps, as the New York Times seems to suggest,Pelosi's goal here is merely to try and link Ryan and the GOP caucus to Putin's hackers.\n\nBut no matter who does the leaking or who loses out as a result of this spying, if the contents of the leaks are related to policy as opposed to private indiscretions, then it is neither reasonable nor ethical for either political party to vow not to use them. Those in office ought to know that they are living, emailing, and tweeting in glass houses and should act accordingly.\n\nWhich is why one has to wonder what exactly it is that Pelosi and the Democrats are worried about. Her going to the trouble of making the request might be motivated by the knowledge that there are some things that could be revealed about her party's activities or plans that would have a serious impact on the election.\n\nLet's reiterate that both Republicans and Democrats ought to be united in their anger and disgust for the activities of those who seek to undermine U.S. security, especially when it pertains to the war against Islamist terror. They should be just as opposed to any leaks that have political implications. But the best and only defense for politicians of every stripe against embarrassing leaks is to not do or write embarrassing things. If they can't remember that, they are taking their own chances and ought not rely on the forbearance of their political opponents to protect them against their own foibles.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 41Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nLast night's preview of the first presidential debate at the military forum held in New York confirmed what many, if not most Americans think about the two leading candidates. In just an hour's worth of gobsmacking political television, both made statements that were disqualifying. Clinton embroidered upon her previous lies about her email scandal and Trump dumped on the U.S. military while giving yet another endorsement to Vladimir Putin. But if voters woke up today scratching their heads about their dismal choice, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, the man even some otherwise sensible people are demanding to have included in the debates, went on television to demonstrate that he is as bad, if not worse, than either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.\n\nThe NBC forum is being perceived in some quarters as a victory for Trump because of the pasting Clinton took from both moderator Matt Lauer and audience members who asked about her email scandal. Liberals think this is all very unfair since it allowed Clinton to spend less time demonstrating that she is more knowledgeable than Trump. But Clinton's continued denials that she knowingly sent classified material on her insecure home server are outrageous. Yet not quite as outrageous as her claim that her server was actually more secure than well-protected systems operated by the government. You can't admit responsibility for what you say was a mistake and in the next breath claim to have done nothing wrong if you want to retain a shred of credibility. Her sense of entitlement about breaking the rules and cavalier attitude toward the truth make for a depressing spectacle. And its because of that combination that Americans don't trust her.\n\nClinton's answers about foreign and security policy -- where she has an advantage over Trump -- weren't much better. Trying to be both a responsible internationalist and an antiwar leftist is an impossible task and Clinton failed miserably. You can't promise to beat ISIS while at the same time vowing never to commit American ground troops to the fight and still sound like you're the serious person you claim to be.\n\nThat Lauer and the audience easily cornered Clinton speaks to her weakness as a politician. That the Today Show host had less success holding Trump accountable for the string of outrageous and false statements that poured forth from his mouth during his half hour speaks to his strength as a media personality. It may also be, as we saw during the Republican primary debates, that the sheer magnitude of his falsehoods is such that it defeats the ability of ordinary people to cope with them.\n\nSuffice it to say that for an American presidential candidate to praise Vladimir Putin and prefer him to our own president is, by itself, disqualifying. The Obama presidency deserves harsh criticism, but anyone who sees the Russian dictator as a role model is simply running for president in the wrong country. That also applies to Trump's trashing of our military, hostility to the presence of women in the armed forces, and clear desire for only those generals who will tell him what he wants to hear. Does anyone really believe he has a \"secret plan\" to defeat ISIS? Even if he does, what are we to make of a man who vows he won't send troops to Iraq or engage in regime change but then says he also intends to steal oil from that country and Libya, a colonial quagmire project that would make George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq look like an act of strategic genius.\n\nThis morning, however, Gary Johnson exceeded Trump and Clinton in the contest to determine which candidate was the most unqualified to be commander-in-chief. On the \"Morning Joe\" program, Mike Barnicle asked Johnson what he would do about the situation in Aleppo. Johnson replied, \"What is Aleppo?\" Barnicle responded, \"You're kidding,\" to which Johnson simply said, \"No,\" with a deer-in-the-headlights look.\n\nLater Johnson issued a statement claiming that he was actually aware of the ongoing human-rights catastrophe in Syria that centers on the siege of Aleppo and apologized for the gaffe. But coming from the same man who claimed at the Libertarian Party convention that he wasn't sure whether U.S. involvement in World War Two was justified, this stunning moment of ignorance ought to eliminate him from consideration for those voters desperate for an alternative to Trump and Clinton.\n\nAmericans will have two more months to hear more from the candidates. But no matter where you stand on the political spectrum, honest observers must admit that within a span of 12 hours, Clinton, Trump, and Johnson have all proved again why none of them should be president.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape.

Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declared:\"Their infrastructure was crumbling. So we know that they used a revenue from sanctions relief to start investing in infrastructure.\" But that was nothing but speculation, and ignorant speculation at that given the reality of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' stranglehold over the Iranian economy.\n\nSometimes, however, it is the smaller purchases that give irrefutable evidence that Iran's plans for the future include neither peace nor moderation. Hence, this article from an Iranian defense outlet talking about the Islamic Republic's decision to purchase AK-103s from Russia. The article describes the AK-103, compares it to the M-16, and presents several arguments about why it is best suited for the future needs of Iran's military. Among the most intriguing, however, is a citation of conflicts in Iraq and Yemen and the conclusion that the future of Iran's needs lay with a rifle useful in urban warfare and close-quarter fighting.\n\nThis is worrisome. Consider what Iran has recently been up to: It's used militias to supersede formal Iraqi military chain of command; it's been involved both directly and by proxy in Syria, as well as in more recent efforts to destabilize Yemen via Houthi proxies; and it's showing increasing aggression toward Bahrain and threatening Saudi Arabia. Perhaps it's time to put aside diplomatic rhetoric and wishful thinking and to start looking at where Iran sees itself in the future and how it's equipping its soldiers for the next decade.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 15Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nPalestinian Authority officials were crying smear yesterday about the report broadcast on Israel's Channel 1 that PA leader Mahmoud Abbas was a Soviet mole. The information comes from an archive kept by KGB defector Vasily Mitrokhin that is widely considered the most authoritative source on Soviet intelligence operations. But while it is embarrassing for someone who is treated like a world leader to be branded as a one-time spy, does it really matter what he was doing in the 1980s long before he succeeded Yasir Arafat?\n\nFrom the point of diplomacy, the answer is a clear \"no.\" Israel, after all, made deals with Arafat, a terrorist whose hands were soaked in innocent Jewish blood. If Abbas were finally willing to take \"yes\" for an answer, rather than to incite hate and violence, no one in Israel would think twice about his KGB past.\n\nAs to the details about Abbas's work for the KGB, it seems very much in keeping with the state of Palestinian nationalism during the era. Most of the various factions that made up the Palestine Liberation Organization identified with the Soviet bloc and depended heavily on Moscow during the Cold War. Abbas was one of many Palestinian operatives who were educated in Russia, where he wrote a doctoral thesis trying to link Zionism to the Nazis and denying the extent of the Holocaust. That he subsequently did some part-time post-graduate information gathering -- and was, by no small coincidence, run by an intelligence operative named Mikhail Bogdanov who is now fellow former KGB veteran Vladimir Putin's envoy to the Middle East -- as a way of paying off his debt to his hosts was hardly surprising.\n\nIsraelis have known about his Holocaust denial since Abbas first came to prominence after the Oslo Accords as Arafat's top deputy and eventual successor. It's also no secret that Abbas was one of the planners and financiers of the 1972 Olympic Munich massacre. If that didn't stop Israeli governments from not only trying to persuade him to make peace but to actively protect him from Hamas, why does anyone think Israelis would care about him gathering information for the Soviets?\n\nNor does the publicizing of this information give the Israeli government any edge over Abbas in talks about the negotiations (that refuses to restart). If the PA leader were to confound observers and summon up the courage to embrace peace and recognize the legitimacy of a Jewish state no matter its borders, then nothing in his past would prevent him from obtaining extensive concessions from the current Israeli government or any possible successor.\n\nIt's possible that Abbas and his Fatah party are worried that this reminder of his past will give a boost to their Hamas rivals. Hamas was contesting the local elections in the West Bank that were scheduled to be held on Oct. 8 and were just postponed by a PA court. Fatah might worry that Abbas's Soviet ties undermine their efforts to compete with the rulers of Gaza for the title of Palestinian defender of Islam.\n\nApologists for Abbas will likely argue that the Palestinians had no choice but to accept Soviet help during a period when they had few other friends. That's true, but the connection with the anti-Semitic Soviet leadership was always more than an alliance of convenience for men like Arafat and Abbas. Moscow was interested in using the Palestinians to undermine the U.S. and its Israeli ally and didn't care if that meant subsidizing a movement dedicated to terrorist violence against Jews.\n\nBut the rejectionism of the Palestinians wasn't merely a strategy but an expression of their identity. Their national purpose was and still is inextricably linked to their century-old war against the Zionists. If men like Abbas can't rise above their sordid past and make peace, it is not just a matter of habit, but also a natural consequence of the political culture steeped in hate that they have helped create.\n\nBeing a former Soviet agent doesn't prevent Abbas from making peace. But it does supply a partial explanation for why he refuses to do it.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:KGBMahmoud AbbasPalestinian Authority15Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles: Campaigns & Elections A Pass For Gaming the System? Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 5Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nWhat's worse: the politician who profits from contributions from those seeking to gain an advantage or the businessman who offers benefits that resemble bribes? That's one of the key questions voters must answer this year in a presidential contest that offers a pair of unsatisfactory choices. The election is still Hillary Clinton's to lose, but if Donald Trump still has a shot at winning -- and recent polls say as much -- it is because a great many Americans are not as angry about the smart aleck who can game the system as they are about the political establishment.\n\nThis dilemma is highlighted by the latest front page New York Times article, which seeks to flesh out the unsavory details about Donald Trump's business career. This one focuses on the well-timed $25,000 contribution the Donald made to the re-election campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013. The donation (and a subsequent fundraiser for her that was held at Trump's Mar A-lago resort) arrived not long before her office decided not to join fraud litigation being pursued against Trump University by the state of New York.\n\nThat would sound suspicious no matter who was doling out the payola, but coming from Trump, it's hard to accept the claims from Bondi and Trump's campaign about it all being an innocent coincidence. Trump is, as the Times recalls, a man who had been fined for illegal campaign contributions and lobbying. He has testified under oath about his massive donations to New York politicians from whom he sought favors. He's also the guy who has openly boasted in books and speeches about his ability to use his wealth to get what he needs from a system he says is \"rigged.\"\n\nThe contribution to Bondi has gotten attention not so much because it was illegal but because it was sloppy. The money came from the Republican candidate's non-profit foundation rather than an account that could make political contributions, and it resulted in another fine for Trump. But like most of his past efforts, it worked. Florida passed on the opportunity to join the suit against the Trump University scam as did other states -- like Texas and California -- whose attorneys general also got generous help from Trump. He may not always pay vendors who provide services to his companies, but he appears to get his money's worth from public servants.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this story, and the many others like it, is that it is not having the effect on his campaign that you might have thought it would. While people who are already opposed to Trump view his scams with disgust, the many who support him don't seem to care much. Indeed, while Trump is still likely to lose in November, stories like the Bondi bribe probably won't be the reason.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe first and most obvious reason is that this is an election that pits the proprietor of Trump University against one of the principals at the Clinton Foundation and the owner of the world's most famous home-brew email server. Clinton's reputation has driven her unfavorable poll ratings to the same stratospheric levels as those of Trump and earned her even worse numbers for being honest and trustworthy.\n\nBut his good fortune goes beyond the lack of a competitor with a pristine reputation. Trump's GOP primary competitors did not have reputations for lying that could compare to Clinton's, and they did their best to highlight Trump's problems. But Trump triumphed because he could denounce the political system that most of them were part of, portraying himself as someone who had transgressed but now saw the light.\n\nAmericans may not be as religious as they once were but they still love a redeemed sinner, and that's what Trump's pose promises. Some may find irony in the moral equivalent of a drunk running on a sobriety platform. But Trump claims that his past ability to work the angles gives him a unique ability to fix it, and that resonates with a lot of voters.\n\nAmericans may actually have a sneaking admiration for the person who is an expert at finagling, but they regard those on the inside -- especially those like the Clintons, who entered politics with little money but are now fabulously wealthy -- with far more anger. If stories like the one about Bondi don't sink Trump it's because many voters, if not most, are answering my question by saying that they think the bribed politician is a lot worse than the person offering them cash.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day.

                    "body": "Campaigns & Elections Leaks? What Are Dems Worried About? Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nOn Tuesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made an unusual request of her Republican counterpart. She wrote House Speaker Paul Ryan asking him to prevent Republicans from using any hacked documents in their re-election campaigns. With the publication of Democratic National Committee emails this summer as a result of what the U.S. government believes was a Russian hacking operation and threats of more such revelations from Wikileaks' Julian Assange, cyber security has become a major issue this fall. Moreover, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin's clear preference for his fanboy Donald Trump, Democrats suspect that if there's going to be any October surprise it will emanate from Moscow and be aimed at Hillary Clinton and her party. But while everyone -- except perhaps Trump -- agrees that neither the Russians nor anyone else should be spying on U.S. politicians -- this request raises a couple of interesting questions about both ethics and politics.\n\nSpying on political enemies is despicable, but examples of the major parties using dirty tricks are not exactly rare in our political history. But the question of whether the product of such spying can be a matter of public debate is a very different thing.\n\nIn a court of law, evidence obtained in illegal searches is considered the \"fruit of a poisoned tree\" and cannot be considered. Political debates, however, aren't and probably shouldn't be so fastidious. What Edward Snowden and Wikileaks and/or their Russian pals are doing to undermine our national security is wrong. But it's not as if the American people were ever going to ignore what these breaches revealed. If the leaks are truthful and are related to policy issues, there is no way to pretend the information is still unknown.\n\nEven when the leaks seem to be a matter of pure political mischief -- such as the publication of DNC emails that revealed the entirely unsurprising information that the staff there were supporting Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders -- it wasn't possible for the Democratic Party to ignore it. That's why Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign. If the Democrats had stuck to the standard Pelosi would impose on the Republicans, she'd still be running the DNC.\n\nThe emails of Democratic members of Congress and their staffs probably have lots of juicy gossip and indiscretions that would be embarrassing. The same is true of the Republicans. It would be unfair for the Russians to decide which of the parties gets embarrassed in this way. Perhaps, as the New York Times seems to suggest,Pelosi's goal here is merely to try and link Ryan and the GOP caucus to Putin's hackers.\n\nBut no matter who does the leaking or who loses out as a result of this spying, if the contents of the leaks are related to policy as opposed to private indiscretions, then it is neither reasonable nor ethical for either political party to vow not to use them. Those in office ought to know that they are living, emailing, and tweeting in glass houses and should act accordingly.\n\nWhich is why one has to wonder what exactly it is that Pelosi and the Democrats are worried about. Her going to the trouble of making the request might be motivated by the knowledge that there are some things that might be revealed about her party's activities or plans that would have a serious impact on the election.\n\nLet's reiterate that both Republicans and Democrats ought to be united in their anger and disgust for the activities of those who seek to undermine U.S. security, especially when it pertains to the war against Islamist terror. They should be just as opposed to any leaks that have political implications. But the best and only defense for politicians of every stripe against embarrassing leaks is to not do or write embarrassing things. If they can't remember that, they are taking their own chances and ought not rely on the forbearance of their political opponents to protect them against their own foibles.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 11Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nLast night's preview of the first presidential debate at the military forum held in New York confirmed what many, if not most Americans think about the two leading candidates. In just an hour's worth of gobsmacking political television, both made statements that were disqualifying. Clinton embroidered upon her previous lies about her email scandal and Trump dumped on the U.S. military while giving yet another endorsement to Vladimir Putin. But if voters woke up today scratching their heads about their dismal choice, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, the man even some otherwise sensible people are demanding to have included in the debates, went on television to demonstrate that he is as bad, if not worse, than either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.\n\nThe NBC forum is being perceived in some quarters as a victory for Trump because of the pasting Clinton took from both moderator Matt Lauer and audience members who asked about her email scandal. Liberals think this is all very unfair since it allowed Clinton to spend less time demonstrating that she is more knowledgeable than Trump. But Clinton's continued denials that she knowingly sent classified material on her insecure home server are outrageous. Yet not quite as outrageous as her claim that her server was actually more secure than well-protected systems operated by the government. You can't admit responsibility for what you say was a mistake and in the next breath claim to have done nothing wrong if you want to retain a shred of credibility. Her sense of entitlement about breaking the rules and cavalier attitude toward the truth make for a depressing spectacle. And its because of that combination that Americans don't trust her.\n\nClinton's answers about foreign and security policy -- where she has an advantage over Trump -- weren't much better. Trying to be both a responsible internationalist and an antiwar leftist is an impossible task and Clinton failed miserably. You can't promise to beat ISIS while at the same time vowing never to commit American ground troops to the fight and still sound like you're the serious person you claim to be.\n\nThat Lauer and the audience easily cornered Clinton speaks to her weakness as a politician. That the Today Show host had less success holding Trump accountable for the string of outrageous and false statements that poured forth from his mouth during his half hour speaks to his strength as a media personality. It may also be, as we saw during the Republican primary debates, that the sheer magnitude of his falsehoods is such that it defeats the ability of ordinary people to cope with them.\n\nSuffice it to say that for an American presidential candidate to praise Vladimir Putin and prefer him to our own president is, by itself, disqualifying. The Obama presidency deserves harsh criticism, but anyone who sees the Russian dictator as a role model is simply running for president in the wrong country. That also applies to Trump's trashing of our military, hostility to the presence of women in the armed forces, and clear desire for only those generals who will tell him what he wants to hear. Does anyone really believe he has a \"secret plan\" to defeat ISIS? Even if he does, what are we to make of a man who vows he won't send troops to Iraq or engage in regime change but then says he also intends to steal oil from that country and Libya, a colonial quagmire project that would make George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq look like an act of strategic genius.\n\nThis morning, however, Gary Johnson exceeded Trump and Clinton in the contest to determine which candidate was the most unqualified to be commander-in-chief. On the \"Morning Joe\" program, Mike Barnicle asked Johnson what he would do about the situation in Aleppo. Johnson replied, \"What is Aleppo?\" Barnicle responded, \"You're kidding,\" to which Johnson simply said, \"No,\" with a deer-in-the-headlights look.\n\nLater Johnson issued a statement claiming that he was actually aware of the ongoing human-rights catastrophe in Syria that centers on the siege of Aleppo and apologized for the gaffe. But coming from the same man who claimed at the Libertarian Party convention that he wasn't sure whether U.S. involvement in World War Two was justified, this stunning moment of ignorance ought to eliminate him from consideration for those voters desperate for an alternative to Trump and Clinton.\n\nAmericans will have two more months to hear more from the candidates. But no matter where you stand on the political spectrum, honest observers must admit that within a span of 12 hours, Clinton, Trump, and Johnson have all proved again why none of them should be president.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period.

Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape.

Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declared:\"Their infrastructure was crumbling. So we know that they used a revenue from sanctions relief to start investing in infrastructure.\" But that was nothing but speculation, and ignorant speculation at that given the reality of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' stranglehold over the Iranian economy.\n\nSometimes, however, it is the smaller purchases that give irrefutable evidence that Iran's plans for the future include neither peace nor moderation. Hence, this article from an Iranian defense outlet talking about the Islamic Republic's decision to purchase AK-103s from Russia. The article describes the AK-103, compares it to the M-16, and presents several arguments about why it is best suited for the future needs of Iran's military. Among the most intriguing, however, is a citation of conflicts in Iraq and Yemen and the conclusion that the future of Iran's needs lay with a rifle useful in urban warfare and close-quarter fighting.\n\nThis is worrisome. Consider what Iran has recently been up to: It's used militias to supersede formal Iraqi military chain of command; it's been involved both directly and by proxy in Syria, as well as in more recent efforts to destabilize Yemen via Houthi proxies; and it's showing increasing aggression toward Bahrain and threatening Saudi Arabia. Perhaps it's time to put aside diplomatic rhetoric and wishful thinking and to start looking at where Iran sees itself in the future and how it's equipping its soldiers for the next decade.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 3Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nPalestinian Authority officials were crying smear yesterday about the report broadcast on Israel's Channel 1 that PA leader Mahmoud Abbas was a Soviet mole. The information comes from an archive kept by KGB defector Vasily Mitrokhin that is widely considered the most authoritative source on Soviet intelligence operations. But while it is embarrassing for someone who is treated like a world leader to be branded as a one-time spy, does it really matter what he was doing in the 1980s long before he succeeded Yasir Arafat?\n\nFrom the point of diplomacy, the answer is a clear \"no.\" Israel, after all, made deals with Arafat, a terrorist whose hands were soaked in innocent Jewish blood. If Abbas were finally willing to take \"yes\" for an answer, rather than to incite hate and violence, no one in Israel would think twice about his KGB past.\n\nAs to the details about Abbas's work for the KGB, it seems very much in keeping with the state of Palestinian nationalism during the era. Most of the various factions that made up the Palestine Liberation Organization identified with the Soviet bloc and depended heavily on Moscow during the Cold War. Abbas was one of many Palestinian operatives who were educated in Russia, where he wrote a doctoral thesis trying to link Zionism to the Nazis and denying the extent of the Holocaust. That he subsequently did some part-time post-graduate information gathering -- and was, by no small coincidence, run by an intelligence operative named Mikhail Bogdanov who is now fellow former KGB veteran Vladimir Putin's envoy to the Middle East -- as a way of paying off his debt to his hosts was hardly surprising.\n\nIsraelis have known about his Holocaust denial since Abbas first came to prominence after the Oslo Accords as Arafat's top deputy and eventual successor. It's also no secret that Abbas was one of the planners and financiers of the 1972 Olympic Munich massacre. If that didn't stop Israeli governments from not only trying to persuade him to make peace but to actively protect him from Hamas, why does anyone think Israelis would care about him gathering information for the Soviets?\n\nNor does the publicizing of this information give the Israeli government any edge over Abbas in talks about the negotiations (that refuses to restart). If the PA leader were to confound observers and summon up the courage to embrace peace and recognize the legitimacy of a Jewish state no matter its borders, then nothing in his past would prevent him from obtaining extensive concessions from the current Israeli government or any possible successor.\n\nIt's possible that Abbas and his Fatah party are worried that this reminder of his past will give a boost to their Hamas rivals. Hamas was contesting the local elections in the West Bank that were scheduled to be held on Oct. 8 and were just postponed by a PA court. Fatah might worry that Abbas's Soviet ties undermine their efforts to compete with the rulers of Gaza for the title of Palestinian defender of Islam.\n\nApologists for Abbas will likely argue that the Palestinians had no choice but to accept Soviet help during a period when they had few other friends. That's true, but the connection with the anti-Semitic Soviet leadership was always more than an alliance of convenience for men like Arafat and Abbas. Moscow was interested in using the Palestinians to undermine the U.S. and its Israeli ally and didn't care if that meant subsidizing a movement dedicated to terrorist violence against Jews.\n\nBut the rejectionism of the Palestinians wasn't merely a strategy but an expression of their identity. Their national purpose was and still is inextricably linked to their century-old war against the Zionists.

Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:KGBMahmoud AbbasPalestinian Authority3Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles: Campaigns & Elections A Pass For Gaming the System?

Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 3Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nWhat's worse: the politician who profits from contributions from those seeking to gain an advantage or the businessman who offers benefits that resemble bribes? That's one of the key questions voters must answer this year in a presidential contest that offers a pair of unsatisfactory choices. The election is still Hillary Clinton's to lose, but if Donald Trump still has a shot at winning -- and recent polls say as much -- it is because a great many Americans are not as angry about the smart aleck who can game the system as they are about the political establishment.\n\nThis dilemma is highlighted by the latest front page New York Times article, which seeks to flesh out the unsavory details about Donald Trump's business career. This one focuses on the well-timed $25,000 contribution the Donald made to the re-election campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013. The donation (and a subsequent fundraiser for her that was held at Trump's Mar A-lago resort) arrived not long before her office decided not to join fraud litigation being pursued against Trump University by the state of New York.\n\nThat would sound suspicious no matter who was doling out the payola, but coming from Trump, it's hard to accept the claims from Bondi and Trump's campaign about it all being an innocent coincidence. Trump is, as the Times recalls, a man who had been fined for illegal campaign contributions and lobbying. He has testified under oath about his massive donations to New York politicians from whom he sought favors. He's also the guy who has openly boasted in books and speeches about his ability to use his wealth to get what he needs from a system he says is \"rigged.\"\n\nThe contribution to Bondi has gotten attention not so much because it was illegal but because it was sloppy. The money came from the Republican candidate's non-profit foundation rather than an account that could make political contributions, and it resulted in another fine for Trump. But like most of his past efforts, it worked. Florida passed on the opportunity to join the suit against the Trump University scam as did other states -- like Texas and California -- whose attorneys general also got generous help from Trump. He may not always pay vendors who provide services to his companies, but he appears to get his money's worth from public servants.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this story, and the many others like it, is that it is not having the effect on his campaign that you might have thought it would. While people who are already opposed to Trump view his scams with disgust, the many who support him don't seem to care much. Indeed, while Trump is still likely to lose in November, stories like the Bondi bribe probably won't be the reason.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe first and most obvious reason is that this is an election that pits the proprietor of Trump University against one of the principals at the Clinton Foundation and the owner of the world's most famous home-brew email server. Clinton's reputation has driven her unfavorable poll ratings to the same stratospheric levels as those of Trump and earned her even worse numbers for being honest and trustworthy.\n\nBut his good fortune goes beyond the lack of a competitor with a pristine reputation. Trump's GOP primary competitors did not have reputations for lying that could compare to Clinton's, and they did their best to highlight Trump's problems. But Trump triumphed because he could denounce the political system that most of them were part of, portraying himself as someone who had transgressed but now saw the light.\n\nAmericans may not be as religious as they once were but they still love a redeemed sinner, and that's what Trump's pose promises. Some may find irony in the moral equivalent of a drunk running on a sobriety platform. But Trump claims that his past ability to work the angles gives him a unique ability to fix it, and that resonates with a lot of voters.\n\nAmericans may actually have a sneaking admiration for the person who is an expert at finagling, but they regard those on the inside -- especially those like the Clintons, who entered politics with little money but are now fabulously wealthy -- with far more anger. If stories like the one about Bondi don't sink Trump it's because many voters, if not most, are answering my question by saying that they think the bribed politician is a lot worse than the person offering them cash.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Max Boot 2016-09-07 Max Boot / Sept. 7, 2016 35Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe White House is sensitive to charges that the president is conducting an \"apology tour\" of the world. And it's true that on Tuesday the president didn't actually apologize in Laos for American actions in the 1960s, but he danced right up to the line.\n\nThis is what he said:\n\nOver nine years -- from 1964 to 1973 -- the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs here in Laos -- more than we dropped on Germany and Japan combined during all of World War II. It made Laos, per person, the most heavily bombed country in history. As one Laotian said, the 'bombs fell like rain.' Villages and entire valleys were obliterated. The ancient Plain of Jars was devastated. Countless civilians were killed. And that conflict was another reminder that, whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts a terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children. Today, I stand with you in acknowledging the suffering and sacrifices on all sides of that conflict.\n\nHe went on to pledge to double U.S. funding, to $90 million a year, to help Laos defuse bombs dropped during the Vietnam War. The problem is a very real one, as I discovered for myself while visiting Laos's Plain of Jars a few months ago -- a tourist site but one where tourists are still warned to look out for unexploded ordnance. Everything Obama said was factual, and there is nothing wrong with his desire to aid Laos -- the U.S. needs as many friends on China's borders as it can find. But his rhetoric was nevertheless one-sided and disappointing.\n\nWhat was lacking, above all, was any context. Someone who listened to Obama's speech and knew nothing of Laos's history would have been left mystified about why the U.S. dropped bombs \"like rain\" on that country. Did Americans harbor irrational fear and prejudice of Laotians? Were the Johnson and Nixon administrations motivated by racial prejudice? Perhaps they were simply staffed by psychopaths and war criminals who enjoyed annihilating small countries?\n\nHardly.\n\nWhat Obama did not mention was that in 1959, preparatory to its invasion of South Vietnam, North Vietnam invaded Laos in order to establish a major segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail bringing weapons, supplies, and manpower from North to South. North Vietnam also sponsored and supported with its own troops a Communist insurgency, the Pathet Lao, to overthrow the Royal Government of Laos. The U.S. responded to this Communist aggression -- conducted in violation of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962 -- by providing covert and overt aid to the government of Laos and to Hmong militias who were fighting the Communists. Unlike in South Vietnam, the U.S. did not send combat troops to Laos; instead it relied on the CIA and the Special Forces to fight a \"secret war\" utilizing Laotians who were determined to resist Communist domination. The most capable American-supported leader was Vang Pao, a Hmong tribesman who was a general in the Lao army. Eventually he led as many as 40,000 guerrillas fighting the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese Army.\n\nThe U.S. bombing of Laos was conducted in support of Vang Pao and other anti-Communist fighters and as part of a general effort to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- the logistics line that enabled aggression against a sovereign state allied with the United States. Those interested in learning more should read my colleague Joshua Kurlantzick's excellent forthcoming book A Great Place to Have a War: America in Laos and the Birth of a Military CIA (out in January from Simon & Schuster).\n\nIt is certainly possible to question the utility and even the morality of U.S. bombing in Laos -- but it is highly misleading for any analyst, much less the president of the United States, to criticize the U.S. in a vacuum without noting the actions of the North Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao who killed countless numbers of Laotian civilians, violated Laotian sovereignty, and ultimately overthrew the internationally recognized government of Laos in order to impose a Communist dictatorship. That dictatorship continues to rule to this day, by the way. It has made some economic reforms primarily to encourage tourism, but it remains a dictatorship that is rated \"not free\" by Freedom House.\n\nTo his credit, Obama did speak out about human rights during his trip although in a particularly mealy-mouthed way. He never directly criticized Laos's human-rights record, which is poor. He never highlighted the plight of dissidents or called for democracy. Instead he spoke in oblique terms about the importance of human rights while making clear that they are not very crucial in the U.S.-Laos relationship: \"As we do around the world, the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of what we consider universal human rights, including the rights of the people of Laos to express yourselves freely and decide your own future. Yet even as our governments deal candidly with our differences, I believe, as we have shown from Cuba to Burma to Vietnam, the best way to deliver progress for all of our peoples is by closer cooperation between our countries. And that's why, today, the United States and Laos have agreed to a new comprehensive partnership to guide and deepen our relationship for years to come.\" In other words, while saying he would speak out on behalf of human rights, Obama did not really do that.\n\nI get what Obama is up to here. He thinks the U.S. can exercise more influence today by acknowledging past \"misconduct\" without directly criticizing the behavior of countries it deals with. The problem is that, in practice, this amounts to kow-towing to dictators from Cuba to Iran and buying into their fiction that the U.S. is guilty of conduct just as bad, if not worse, than what they have done. That simply isn't true, and by shading the truth the president is failing to speak on behalf of the principles upon which the United States was founded-and which have long been our most powerful tool and selling point in international affairs. He is also inadvertently buttressing the dictatorships he is dealing with; now they can turn to their people and say in essence, \"Our problems are America's fault-the president of the United States even said so.\" What we have seen during the two terms of the Obama presidency is that by failing to speak out more robustly on behalf of freedom, the president is not winning any friends; he is simply convincing the world's dictators that he is a patsy who can be pushed around with impunity.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason.

Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nLast night's preview of the first presidential debate at the military forum held in New York confirmed what many, if not most Americans think about the two leading candidates. In just an hour's worth of gobsmacking political television, both made statements that were disqualifying. Clinton embroidered upon her previous lies about her email scandal and Trump dumped on the U.S. military while giving yet another endorsement to Vladimir Putin. But if voters woke up today scratching their heads about their dismal choice, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, the man even some otherwise sensible people are demanding to have included in the debates, went on television to demonstrate that he is as bad, if not worse, than either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.\n\nThe NBC forum is being perceived in some quarters as a victory for Trump because of the pasting Clinton took from both moderator Matt Lauer and audience members who asked about her email scandal. Liberals think this is all very unfair since it allowed Clinton to spend less time demonstrating that she is more knowledgeable than Trump. But Clinton's continued denials that she knowingly sent classified material on her insecure home server are outrageous. Yet not quite as outrageous as her claim that her server was actually more secure than well-protected systems operated by the government. You can't admit responsibility for what you say was a mistake and in the next breath claim to have done nothing wrong if you want to retain a shred of credibility. Her sense of entitlement about breaking the rules and cavalier attitude toward the truth make for a depressing spectacle. And its because of that combination that Americans don't trust her.\n\nClinton's answers about foreign and security policy -- where she has an advantage over Trump -- weren't much better. Trying to be both a responsible internationalist and an antiwar leftist is an impossible task and Clinton failed miserably. You can't promise to beat ISIS while at the same time vowing never to commit American ground troops to the fight and still sound like you're the serious person you claim to be.\n\nThat Lauer and the audience easily cornered Clinton speaks to her weakness as a politician. That the Today Show host had less success holding Trump accountable for the string of outrageous and false statements that poured forth from his mouth during his half hour speaks to his strength as a media personality. It may also be, as we saw during the Republican primary debates, that the sheer magnitude of his falsehoods is such that it defeats the ability of ordinary people to cope with them.\n\nSuffice it to say that for an American presidential candidate to praise Vladimir Putin and prefer him to our own president is, by itself, disqualifying. The Obama presidency deserves harsh criticism, but anyone who sees the Russian dictator as a role model is simply running for president in the wrong country. That also applies to Trump's trashing of our military, hostility to the presence of women in the armed forces, and clear desire for only those generals who will tell him what he wants to hear. Does anyone really believe he has a \"secret plan\" to defeat ISIS? Even if he does, what are we to make of a man who vows he won't send troops to Iraq or engage in regime change but then says he also intends to steal oil from that country and Libya, a colonial quagmire project that would make George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq look like an act of strategic genius.\n\nThis morning, however, Gary Johnson exceeded Trump and Clinton in the contest to determine which candidate was the most unqualified to be commander-in-chief. On the \"Morning Joe\" program, Mike Barnicle asked Johnson what he would do about the situation in Aleppo. Johnson replied, \"What is Aleppo?\" Barnicle responded, \"You're kidding,\" to which Johnson simply said, \"No,\" with a deer-in-the-headlights look.\n\nLater Johnson issued a statement claiming that he was actually aware of the ongoing human-rights catastrophe in Syria that centers on the siege of Aleppo and apologized for the gaffe. But coming from the same man who claimed at the Libertarian Party convention that he wasn't sure whether U.S. involvement in World War Two was justified, this stunning moment of ignorance ought to eliminate him from consideration for those voters desperate for an alternative to Trump and Clinton.\n\nAmericans will have two more months to hear more from the candidates. But no matter where you stand on the political spectrum, honest observers must admit that within a span of 12 hours, Clinton, Trump, and Johnson have all proved again why none of them should be president.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

The magazine you are now reading.

In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack.

Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declared:\"Their infrastructure was crumbling. So we know that they used a revenue from sanctions relief to start investing in infrastructure.\" But that was nothing but speculation, and ignorant speculation at that given the reality of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' stranglehold over the Iranian economy.\n\nSometimes, however, it is the smaller purchases that give irrefutable evidence that Iran's plans for the future include neither peace nor moderation. Hence, this article from an Iranian defense outlet talking about the Islamic Republic's decision to purchase AK-103s from Russia. The article describes the AK-103, compares it to the M-16, and presents several arguments about why it is best suited for the future needs of Iran's military. Among the most intriguing, however, is a citation of conflicts in Iraq and Yemen and the conclusion that the future of Iran's needs lay with a rifle useful in urban warfare and close-quarter fighting.\n\nThis is worrisome. Consider what Iran has recently been up to: It's used militias to supersede formal Iraqi military chain of command; it's been involved both directly and by proxy in Syria, as well as in more recent efforts to destabilize Yemen via Houthi proxies; and it's showing increasing aggression toward Bahrain and threatening Saudi Arabia. Perhaps it's time to put aside diplomatic rhetoric and wishful thinking and to start looking at where Iran sees itself in the future and how it's equipping its soldiers for the next decade.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 3Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nPalestinian Authority officials were crying smear yesterday about the report broadcast on Israel's Channel 1 that PA leader Mahmoud Abbas was a Soviet mole. The information comes from an archive kept by KGB defector Vasily Mitrokhin that is widely considered the most authoritative source on Soviet intelligence operations. But while it is embarrassing for someone who is treated like a world leader to be branded as a one-time spy, does it really matter what he was doing in the 1980s long before he succeeded Yasir Arafat?\n\nFrom the point of diplomacy, the answer is a clear \"no.\" Israel, after all, made deals with Arafat, a terrorist whose hands were soaked in innocent Jewish blood. If Abbas were finally willing to take \"yes\" for an answer, rather than to incite hate and violence, no one in Israel would think twice about his KGB past.\n\nAs to the details about Abbas's work for the KGB, it seems very much in keeping with the state of Palestinian nationalism during the era. Most of the various factions that made up the Palestine Liberation Organization identified with the Soviet bloc and depended heavily on Moscow during the Cold War. Abbas was one of many Palestinian operatives who were educated in Russia, where he wrote a doctoral thesis trying to link Zionism to the Nazis and denying the extent of the Holocaust. That he subsequently did some part-time post-graduate information gathering -- and was, by no small coincidence, run by an intelligence operative named Mikhail Bogdanov who is now fellow former KGB veteran Vladimir Putin's envoy to the Middle East -- as a way of paying off his debt to his hosts was hardly surprising.\n\nIsraelis have known about his Holocaust denial since Abbas first came to prominence after the Oslo Accords as Arafat's top deputy and eventual successor. It's also no secret that Abbas was one of the planners and financiers of the 1972 Olympic Munich massacre. If that didn't stop Israeli governments from not only trying to persuade him to make peace but to actively protect him from Hamas, why does anyone think Israelis would care about him gathering information for the Soviets?\n\nNor does the publicizing of this information give the Israeli government any edge over Abbas in talks about the negotiations (that refuses to restart). If the PA leader were to confound observers and summon up the courage to embrace peace and recognize the legitimacy of a Jewish state no matter its borders, then nothing in his past would prevent him from obtaining extensive concessions from the current Israeli government or any possible successor.\n\nIt's possible that Abbas and his Fatah party are worried that this reminder of his past will give a boost to their Hamas rivals. Hamas was contesting the local elections in the West Bank that were scheduled to be held on Oct. 8 and were just postponed by a PA court. Fatah might worry that Abbas's Soviet ties undermine their efforts to compete with the rulers of Gaza for the title of Palestinian defender of Islam.\n\nApologists for Abbas will likely argue that the Palestinians had no choice but to accept Soviet help during a period when they had few other friends. That's true, but the connection with the anti-Semitic Soviet leadership was always more than an alliance of convenience for men like Arafat and Abbas. Moscow was interested in using the Palestinians to undermine the U.S. and its Israeli ally and didn't care if that meant subsidizing a movement dedicated to terrorist violence against Jews.\n\nBut the rejectionism of the Palestinians wasn't merely a strategy but an expression of their identity. Their national purpose was and still is inextricably linked to their century-old war against the Zionists. If men like Abbas can't rise above their sordid past and make peace, it is not just a matter of habit, but also a natural consequence of the political culture steeped in hate that they have helped create.\n\nBeing a former Soviet agent doesn't prevent Abbas from making peace. But it does supply a partial explanation for why he refuses to do it.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 3Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nWhat's worse: the politician who profits from contributions from those seeking to gain an advantage or the businessman who offers benefits that resemble bribes? That's one of the key questions voters must answer this year in a presidential contest that offers a pair of unsatisfactory choices. The election is still Hillary Clinton's to lose, but if Donald Trump still has a shot at winning -- and recent polls say as much -- it is because a great many Americans are not as angry about the smart aleck who can game the system as they are about the political establishment.\n\nThis dilemma is highlighted by the latest front page New York Times article, which seeks to flesh out the unsavory details about Donald Trump's business career. This one focuses on the well-timed $25,000 contribution the Donald made to the re-election campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013. The donation (and a subsequent fundraiser for her that was held at Trump's Mar A-lago resort) arrived not long before her office decided not to join fraud litigation being pursued against Trump University by the state of New York.\n\nThat would sound suspicious no matter who was doling out the payola, but coming from Trump, it's hard to accept the claims from Bondi and Trump's campaign about it all being an innocent coincidence. Trump is, as the Times recalls, a man who had been fined for illegal campaign contributions and lobbying. He has testified under oath about his massive donations to New York politicians from whom he sought favors. He's also the guy who has openly boasted in books and speeches about his ability to use his wealth to get what he needs from a system he says is \"rigged.\"\n\nThe contribution to Bondi has gotten attention not so much because it was illegal but because it was sloppy. The money came from the Republican candidate's non-profit foundation rather than an account that could make political contributions, and it resulted in another fine for Trump. But like most of his past efforts, it worked. Florida passed on the opportunity to join the suit against the Trump University scam as did other states -- like Texas and California -- whose attorneys general also got generous help from Trump. He may not always pay vendors who provide services to his companies, but he appears to get his money's worth from public servants.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this story, and the many others like it, is that it is not having the effect on his campaign that you might have thought it would. While people who are already opposed to Trump view his scams with disgust, the many who support him don't seem to care much. Indeed, while Trump is still likely to lose in November, stories like the Bondi bribe probably won't be the reason.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe first and most obvious reason is that this is an election that pits the proprietor of Trump University against one of the principals at the Clinton Foundation and the owner of the world's most famous home-brew email server. Clinton's reputation has driven her unfavorable poll ratings to the same stratospheric levels as those of Trump and earned her even worse numbers for being honest and trustworthy.\n\nBut his good fortune goes beyond the lack of a competitor with a pristine reputation. Trump's GOP primary competitors did not have reputations for lying that could compare to Clinton's, and they did their best to highlight Trump's problems. But Trump triumphed because he could denounce the political system that most of them were part of, portraying himself as someone who had transgressed but now saw the light.\n\nAmericans may not be as religious as they once were but they still love a redeemed sinner, and that's what Trump's pose promises. Some may find irony in the moral equivalent of a drunk running on a sobriety platform. But Trump claims that his past ability to work the angles gives him a unique ability to fix it, and that resonates with a lot of voters.\n\nAmericans may actually have a sneaking admiration for the person who is an expert at finagling, but they regard those on the inside -- especially those like the Clintons, who entered politics with little money but are now fabulously wealthy -- with far more anger. If stories like the one about Bondi don't sink Trump it's because many voters, if not most, are answering my question by saying that they think the bribed politician is a lot worse than the person offering them cash.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Max Boot 2016-09-07 Max Boot / Sept. 7, 2016 32Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe White House is sensitive to charges that the president is conducting an \"apology tour\" of the world. And it's true that on Tuesday the president didn't actually apologize in Laos for American actions in the 1960s, but he danced right up to the line.\n\nThis is what he said:\n\nOver nine years -- from 1964 to 1973 -- the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs here in Laos -- more than we dropped on Germany and Japan combined during all of World War II. It made Laos, per person, the most heavily bombed country in history. As one Laotian said, the 'bombs fell like rain.' Villages and entire valleys were obliterated. The ancient Plain of Jars was devastated. Countless civilians were killed. And that conflict was another reminder that, whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts a terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children. Today, I stand with you in acknowledging the suffering and sacrifices on all sides of that conflict.\n\nHe went on to pledge to double U.S. funding, to $90 million a year, to help Laos defuse bombs dropped during the Vietnam War. The problem is a very real one, as I discovered for myself while visiting Laos's Plain of Jars a few months ago -- a tourist site but one where tourists are still warned to look out for unexploded ordnance. Everything Obama said was factual, and there is nothing wrong with his desire to aid Laos -- the U.S. needs as many friends on China's borders as it can find. But his rhetoric was nevertheless one-sided and disappointing.\n\nWhat was lacking, above all, was any context. Someone who listened to Obama's speech and knew nothing of Laos's history would have been left mystified about why the U.S. dropped bombs \"like rain\" on that country. Did Americans harbor irrational fear and prejudice of Laotians? Were the Johnson and Nixon administrations motivated by racial prejudice? Perhaps they were simply staffed by psychopaths and war criminals who enjoyed annihilating small countries?\n\nHardly.\n\nWhat Obama did not mention was that in 1959, preparatory to its invasion of South Vietnam, North Vietnam invaded Laos in order to establish a major segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail bringing weapons, supplies, and manpower from North to South. North Vietnam also sponsored and supported with its own troops a Communist insurgency, the Pathet Lao, to overthrow the Royal Government of Laos. The U.S. responded to this Communist aggression -- conducted in violation of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962 -- by providing covert and overt aid to the government of Laos and to Hmong militias who were fighting the Communists. Unlike in South Vietnam, the U.S. did not send combat troops to Laos; instead it relied on the CIA and the Special Forces to fight a \"secret war\" utilizing Laotians who were determined to resist Communist domination. The most capable American-supported leader was Vang Pao, a Hmong tribesman who was a general in the Lao army. Eventually he led as many as 40,000 guerrillas fighting the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese Army.\n\nThe U.S. bombing of Laos was conducted in support of Vang Pao and other anti-Communist fighters and as part of a general effort to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- the logistics line that enabled aggression against a sovereign state allied with the United States. Those interested in learning more should read my colleague Joshua Kurlantzick's excellent forthcoming book A Great Place to Have a War: America in Laos and the Birth of a Military CIA (out in January from Simon & Schuster).\n\nIt is certainly possible to question the utility and even the morality of U.S. bombing in Laos -- but it is highly misleading for any analyst, much less the president of the United States, to criticize the U.S. in a vacuum without noting the actions of the North Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao who killed countless numbers of Laotian civilians, violated Laotian sovereignty, and ultimately overthrew the internationally recognized government of Laos in order to impose a Communist dictatorship. That dictatorship continues to rule to this day, by the way. It has made some economic reforms primarily to encourage tourism, but it remains a dictatorship that is rated \"not free\" by Freedom House.\n\nTo his credit, Obama did speak out about human rights during his trip although in a particularly mealy-mouthed way. He never directly criticized Laos's human-rights record, which is poor. He never highlighted the plight of dissidents or called for democracy. Instead he spoke in oblique terms about the importance of human rights while making clear that they are not very crucial in the U.S.-Laos relationship: \"As we do around the world, the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of what we consider universal human rights, including the rights of the people of Laos to express yourselves freely and decide your own future. Yet even as our governments deal candidly with our differences, I believe, as we have shown from Cuba to Burma to Vietnam, the best way to deliver progress for all of our peoples is by closer cooperation between our countries. And that's why, today, the United States and Laos have agreed to a new comprehensive partnership to guide and deepen our relationship for years to come.\" In other words, while saying he would speak out on behalf of human rights, Obama did not really do that.\n\nI get what Obama is up to here. He thinks the U.S. can exercise more influence today by acknowledging past \"misconduct\" without directly criticizing the behavior of countries it deals with. The problem is that, in practice, this amounts to kow-towing to dictators from Cuba to Iran and buying into their fiction that the U.S. is guilty of conduct just as bad, if not worse, than what they have done. That simply isn't true, and by shading the truth the president is failing to speak on behalf of the principles upon which the United States was founded-and which have long been our most powerful tool and selling point in international affairs. He is also inadvertently buttressing the dictatorships he is dealing with; now they can turn to their people and say in essence, \"Our problems are America's fault-the president of the United States even said so.\" What we have seen during the two terms of the Obama presidency is that by failing to speak out more robustly on behalf of freedom, the president is not winning any friends; he is simply convincing the world's dictators that he is a patsy who can be pushed around with impunity.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers.

It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here 6Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",

                    "body": "Iran What Iran's Rifle Purchases Mean Michael Rubin 2016-09-08 Michael Rubin / Sept. 8, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nMuch of the press attention on Iranian spending in the wake of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the lifting of many sanctions has focused on its ballistic missile investments or its efforts to acquire big-ticket military platforms: the delivery of S-300 surface-to-air missiles, Russian Sukhoi fighter jets, and T-90 tanks, for example. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declared:\"Their infrastructure was crumbling. So we know that they used a revenue from sanctions relief to start investing in infrastructure.\" But that was nothing but speculation, and ignorant speculation at that given the reality of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' stranglehold over the Iranian economy.\n\nSometimes, however, it is the smaller purchases that give irrefutable evidence that Iran's plans for the future include neither peace nor moderation. Hence, this article from an Iranian defense outlet talking about the Islamic Republic's decision to purchase AK-103s from Russia. The article describes the AK-103, compares it to the M-16, and presents several arguments about why it is best suited for the future needs of Iran's military. Among the most intriguing, however, is a citation of conflicts in Iraq and Yemen and the conclusion that the future of Iran's needs lay with a rifle useful in urban warfare and close-quarter fighting.\n\nThis is worrisome. Consider what Iran has recently been up to: It's used militias to supersede formal Iraqi military chain of command; it's been involved both directly and by proxy in Syria, as well as in more recent efforts to destabilize Yemen via Houthi proxies; and it's showing increasing aggression toward Bahrain and threatening Saudi Arabia. Perhaps it's time to put aside diplomatic rhetoric and wishful thinking and to start looking at where Iran sees itself in the future and how it's equipping its soldiers for the next decade.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nPalestinian Authority officials were crying smear yesterday about the report broadcast on Israel's Channel 1 that PA leader Mahmoud Abbas was a Soviet mole. The information comes from an archive kept by KGB defector Vasily Mitrokhin that is widely considered the most authoritative source on Soviet intelligence operations. But while it is embarrassing for someone who is treated like a world leader to be branded as a one-time spy, does it really matter what he was doing in the 1980s long before he succeeded Yasir Arafat?\n\nFrom the point of diplomacy, the answer is a clear \"no.\" Israel, after all, made deals with Arafat, a terrorist whose hands were soaked in innocent Jewish blood. If Abbas were finally willing to take \"yes\" for an answer, rather than to incite hate and violence, no one in Israel would think twice about his KGB past.\n\nAs to the details about Abbas's work for the KGB, it seems very much in keeping with the state of Palestinian nationalism during the era. Most of the various factions that made up the Palestine Liberation Organization identified with the Soviet bloc and depended heavily on Moscow during the Cold War. Abbas was one of many Palestinian operatives who were educated in Russia, where he wrote a doctoral thesis trying to link Zionism to the Nazis and denying the extent of the Holocaust. That he subsequently did some part-time post-graduate information gathering -- and was, by no small coincidence, run by an intelligence operative named Mikhail Bogdanov who is now fellow former KGB veteran Vladimir Putin's envoy to the Middle East -- as a way of paying off his debt to his hosts was hardly surprising.\n\nIsraelis have known about his Holocaust denial since Abbas first came to prominence after the Oslo Accords as Arafat's top deputy and eventual successor. It's also no secret that Abbas was one of the planners and financiers of the 1972 Olympic Munich massacre. If that didn't stop Israeli governments from not only trying to persuade him to make peace but to actively protect him from Hamas, why does anyone think Israelis would care about him gathering information for the Soviets?\n\nNor does the publicizing of this information give the Israeli government any edge over Abbas in talks about the negotiations (that refuses to restart). If the PA leader were to confound observers and summon up the courage to embrace peace and recognize the legitimacy of a Jewish state no matter its borders, then nothing in his past would prevent him from obtaining extensive concessions from the current Israeli government or any possible successor.\n\nIt's possible that Abbas and his Fatah party are worried that this reminder of his past will give a boost to their Hamas rivals. Hamas was contesting the local elections in the West Bank that were scheduled to be held on Oct. 8 and were just postponed by a PA court. Fatah might worry that Abbas's Soviet ties undermine their efforts to compete with the rulers of Gaza for the title of Palestinian defender of Islam.\n\nApologists for Abbas will likely argue that the Palestinians had no choice but to accept Soviet help during a period when they had few other friends. That's true, but the connection with the anti-Semitic Soviet leadership was always more than an alliance of convenience for men like Arafat and Abbas. Moscow was interested in using the Palestinians to undermine the U.S. and its Israeli ally and didn't care if that meant subsidizing a movement dedicated to terrorist violence against Jews.\n\nBut the rejectionism of the Palestinians wasn't merely a strategy but an expression of their identity. Their national purpose was and still is inextricably linked to their century-old war against the Zionists. If men like Abbas can't rise above their sordid past and make peace, it is not just a matter of habit, but also a natural consequence of the political culture steeped in hate that they have helped create.\n\nBeing a former Soviet agent doesn't prevent Abbas from making peace. But it does supply a partial explanation for why he refuses to do it.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history.

Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 3Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nWhat's worse: the politician who profits from contributions from those seeking to gain an advantage or the businessman who offers benefits that resemble bribes? That's one of the key questions voters must answer this year in a presidential contest that offers a pair of unsatisfactory choices. The election is still Hillary Clinton's to lose, but if Donald Trump still has a shot at winning -- and recent polls say as much -- it is because a great many Americans are not as angry about the smart aleck who can game the system as they are about the political establishment.\n\nThis dilemma is highlighted by the latest front page New York Times article, which seeks to flesh out the unsavory details about Donald Trump's business career. This one focuses on the well-timed $25,000 contribution the Donald made to the re-election campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013. The donation (and a subsequent fundraiser for her that was held at Trump's Mar A-lago resort) arrived not long before her office decided not to join fraud litigation being pursued against Trump University by the state of New York.\n\nThat would sound suspicious no matter who was doling out the payola, but coming from Trump, it's hard to accept the claims from Bondi and Trump's campaign about it all being an innocent coincidence. Trump is, as the Times recalls, a man who had been fined for illegal campaign contributions and lobbying. He has testified under oath about his massive donations to New York politicians from whom he sought favors. He's also the guy who has openly boasted in books and speeches about his ability to use his wealth to get what he needs from a system he says is \"rigged.\"\n\nThe contribution to Bondi has gotten attention not so much because it was illegal but because it was sloppy. The money came from the Republican candidate's non-profit foundation rather than an account that could make political contributions, and it resulted in another fine for Trump. But like most of his past efforts, it worked. Florida passed on the opportunity to join the suit against the Trump University scam as did other states -- like Texas and California -- whose attorneys general also got generous help from Trump. He may not always pay vendors who provide services to his companies, but he appears to get his money's worth from public servants.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this story, and the many others like it, is that it is not having the effect on his campaign that you might have thought it would. While people who are already opposed to Trump view his scams with disgust, the many who support him don't seem to care much. Indeed, while Trump is still likely to lose in November, stories like the Bondi bribe probably won't be the reason.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe first and most obvious reason is that this is an election that pits the proprietor of Trump University against one of the principals at the Clinton Foundation and the owner of the world's most famous home-brew email server. Clinton's reputation has driven her unfavorable poll ratings to the same stratospheric levels as those of Trump and earned her even worse numbers for being honest and trustworthy.\n\nBut his good fortune goes beyond the lack of a competitor with a pristine reputation. Trump's GOP primary competitors did not have reputations for lying that could compare to Clinton's, and they did their best to highlight Trump's problems. But Trump triumphed because he could denounce the political system that most of them were part of, portraying himself as someone who had transgressed but now saw the light.\n\nAmericans may not be as religious as they once were but they still love a redeemed sinner, and that's what Trump's pose promises. Some may find irony in the moral equivalent of a drunk running on a sobriety platform. But Trump claims that his past ability to work the angles gives him a unique ability to fix it, and that resonates with a lot of voters.\n\nAmericans may actually have a sneaking admiration for the person who is an expert at finagling, but they regard those on the inside -- especially those like the Clintons, who entered politics with little money but are now fabulously wealthy -- with far more anger. If stories like the one about Bondi don't sink Trump it's because many voters, if not most, are answering my question by saying that they think the bribed politician is a lot worse than the person offering them cash.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Max Boot 2016-09-07 Max Boot / Sept. 7, 2016 17Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe White House is sensitive to charges that the president is conducting an \"apology tour\" of the world. And it's true that on Tuesday the president didn't actually apologize in Laos for American actions in the 1960s, but he danced right up to the line.\n\nThis is what he said:\n\nOver nine years -- from 1964 to 1973 -- the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs here in Laos -- more than we dropped on Germany and Japan combined during all of World War II. It made Laos, per person, the most heavily bombed country in history. As one Laotian said, the 'bombs fell like rain.' Villages and entire valleys were obliterated. The ancient Plain of Jars was devastated. Countless civilians were killed. And that conflict was another reminder that, whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts a terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children. Today, I stand with you in acknowledging the suffering and sacrifices on all sides of that conflict.\n\nHe went on to pledge to double U.S. funding, to $90 million a year, to help Laos defuse bombs dropped during the Vietnam War. The problem is a very real one, as I discovered for myself while visiting Laos's Plain of Jars a few months ago -- a tourist site but one where tourists are still warned to look out for unexploded ordnance. Everything Obama said was factual, and there is nothing wrong with his desire to aid Laos -- the U.S. needs as many friends on China's borders as it can find. But his rhetoric was nevertheless one-sided and disappointing.\n\nWhat was lacking, above all, was any context. Someone who listened to Obama's speech and knew nothing of Laos's history would have been left mystified about why the U.S. dropped bombs \"like rain\" on that country. Did Americans harbor irrational fear and prejudice of Laotians? Were the Johnson and Nixon administrations motivated by racial prejudice? Perhaps they were simply staffed by psychopaths and war criminals who enjoyed annihilating small countries?\n\nHardly.\n\nWhat Obama did not mention was that in 1959, preparatory to its invasion of South Vietnam, North Vietnam invaded Laos in order to establish a major segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail bringing weapons, supplies, and manpower from North to South. North Vietnam also sponsored and supported with its own troops a Communist insurgency, the Pathet Lao, to overthrow the Royal Government of Laos. The U.S. responded to this Communist aggression -- conducted in violation of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962 -- by providing covert and overt aid to the government of Laos and to Hmong militias who were fighting the Communists. Unlike in South Vietnam, the U.S. did not send combat troops to Laos; instead it relied on the CIA and the Special Forces to fight a \"secret war\" utilizing Laotians who were determined to resist Communist domination. The most capable American-supported leader was Vang Pao, a Hmong tribesman who was a general in the Lao army. Eventually he led as many as 40,000 guerrillas fighting the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese Army.\n\nThe U.S. bombing of Laos was conducted in support of Vang Pao and other anti-Communist fighters and as part of a general effort to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- the logistics line that enabled aggression against a sovereign state allied with the United States. Those interested in learning more should read my colleague Joshua Kurlantzick's excellent forthcoming book A Great Place to Have a War: America in Laos and the Birth of a Military CIA (out in January from Simon & Schuster).\n\nIt is certainly possible to question the utility and even the morality of U.S. bombing in Laos -- but it is highly misleading for any analyst, much less the president of the United States, to criticize the U.S. in a vacuum without noting the actions of the North Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao who killed countless numbers of Laotian civilians, violated Laotian sovereignty, and ultimately overthrew the internationally recognized government of Laos in order to impose a Communist dictatorship. That dictatorship continues to rule to this day, by the way. It has made some economic reforms primarily to encourage tourism, but it remains a dictatorship that is rated \"not free\" by Freedom House.\n\nTo his credit, Obama did speak out about human rights during his trip although in a particularly mealy-mouthed way. He never directly criticized Laos's human-rights record, which is poor. He never highlighted the plight of dissidents or called for democracy. Instead he spoke in oblique terms about the importance of human rights while making clear that they are not very crucial in the U.S.-Laos relationship: \"As we do around the world, the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of what we consider universal human rights, including the rights of the people of Laos to express yourselves freely and decide your own future. Yet even as our governments deal candidly with our differences, I believe, as we have shown from Cuba to Burma to Vietnam, the best way to deliver progress for all of our peoples is by closer cooperation between our countries. And that's why, today, the United States and Laos have agreed to a new comprehensive partnership to guide and deepen our relationship for years to come.\" In other words, while saying he would speak out on behalf of human rights, Obama did not really do that.\n\nI get what Obama is up to here. He thinks the U.S. can exercise more influence today by acknowledging past \"misconduct\" without directly criticizing the behavior of countries it deals with. The problem is that, in practice, this amounts to kow-towing to dictators from Cuba to Iran and buying into their fiction that the U.S. is guilty of conduct just as bad, if not worse, than what they have done. That simply isn't true, and by shading the truth the president is failing to speak on behalf of the principles upon which the United States was founded-and which have long been our most powerful tool and selling point in international affairs. He is also inadvertently buttressing the dictatorships he is dealing with; now they can turn to their people and say in essence, \"Our problems are America's fault-the president of the United States even said so.\" What we have seen during the two terms of the Obama presidency is that by failing to speak out more robustly on behalf of freedom, the president is not winning any friends; he is simply convincing the world's dictators that he is a patsy who can be pushed around with impunity.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always.

Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here 6Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles: Iran Can Only Trump Save Israel? Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 10Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nDonald Trump is many things but subtle isn't one of them. While campaigning in Ohio yesterday, he said that Iran \"is going to destroy Israel unless I get elected.\" But if he wins, \"then Israel will be just fine.\" That's a pretty simple formulation and it's one that some friends of the Jewish state are buying. Are they right?\n\nThe basic premise of this apocalyptic argument is that the nuclear deal the Obama administration struck with Iran poses an existential threat to the state of Israel. Trump is right about that. The deal makes an Iranian bomb possible in the long term while also enriching the regime and strengthening its ability to support terror and harass Israel via its Hezbollah auxiliaries and Hamas allies.\n\nThe question is, what can Trump do about it? Or at least what would he do that Hillary Clinton won't?\n\nThe first advantage Trump has is that he enters the Iran debate with clean hands, having never supported President Obama's goal of rapprochement with Tehran. The same cannot be said of Clinton. No, the deal didn't happen on Clinton's watch and it might not have come to pass had she not been replaced by John Kerry at the State Department since he ardent supporter of Obama's approach on Iran. But she still supported the negotiations and the dismal final result.\n\nClinton says she will zealously enforce the terms of the deal and has made noises -- while keeping as little daylight between herself and President Obama as possible for the purposes of the campaign -- about getting tougher on Iranian behavior in the region.\n\nIn contrast to most of the other Republican presidential candidates, Trump never said he would tear up the deal. He has merely held it up as a terrible negotiation in which the U.S. gave up its goals and got little in return. The assumption is that somehow he will attempt to renegotiate or re-impose sanctions to get better terms. But since America's European allies will never go along with such a scenario, short of war, that isn't going to happen. So other than a more robust rhetorical approach to Iran, it's not clear what functional difference there will be between his Iran policy and that of Clinton.\n\nBut for all of his justified criticism of the nuclear deal, the rest of Trump's foreign and Middle East policy hints at a less contentious approach to Iran.\n\nAs Trump said in his security-policy speech delivered today in Philadelphia, he will \"work with any country\" provided they are willing to cooperate in the struggle against ISIS. While specifically eschewing regime change in any country in the region, he said \"new friendships and partnerships\" would be pursued in \"this mission.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means that Trump is interested in cooperating with Russia and, since he wants the U.S. to shoulder as little responsibility for Middle East security as possible, he seems just as willing as Obama to allow Vladimir Putin a free hand in Syria and other trouble spots. And because Russia is in business with Iran in their joint effort to preserve the Assad regime in Syria a Trump administration would appear to be pursuing the same strategic goals as Obama. Given Trump's disdain for efforts to overturn the theocratic dictatorship in Tehran and his general opposition to U.S. military interventions, friends of the Jewish state may be forgiven for dismissing all this talk about preventing Israel's destruction as mere rhetoric.\n\nPro-Israel advocates would do well to be just as skeptical of Clinton's claims as a champion of Israel. We don't know whether Trump would pursue renewed negotiations with the Palestinians or pressure Israel to help him create a peace deal. He is probably less interested, however, in a continuation of the same failed policies pursued by both the Clinton and the Obama administration. But if you're judging the two candidates on their ability to enable Israel to survive the threat from Iran, Trump's case seems less impressive in the context of his advocacy for more \"realism\" -- a word that has always been synonymous with policies that are hostile to Israeli security. Moreover, Israelis know better than to rest their safety on anything other than their own strength.\n\nPut simply, Trump's goals are mutually exclusive. The U.S. can't abandon the region while simultaneously enhancing Israel's security. And no matter how magical your negotiating skills might be, you can't have better relations with Russia and work with Iran against ISIS while also pursuing a tougher policy against the latter's nuclear program.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:Donald TrumpIran nuclear dealIsrael10Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",

                    "body": "Middle East Does Abbas's KGB Past Matter? Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-08 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 8, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nPalestinian Authority officials were crying smear yesterday about the report broadcast on Israel's Channel 1 that PA leader Mahmoud Abbas was a Soviet mole. The information comes from an archive kept by KGB defector Vasily Mitrokhin that is widely considered the most authoritative source on Soviet intelligence operations. But while it is embarrassing for someone who is treated like a world leader to be branded as a one-time spy, does it really matter what he was doing in the 1980s long before he succeeded Yasir Arafat?\n\nFrom the point of diplomacy, the answer is a clear \"no.\" Israel, after all, made deals with Arafat, a terrorist whose hands were soaked in innocent Jewish blood. If Abbas were finally willing to take \"yes\" for an answer, rather than to incite hate and violence, no one in Israel would think twice about his KGB past.\n\nAs to the details about Abbas's work for the KGB, it seems very much in keeping with the state of Palestinian nationalism during the era. Most of the various factions that made up the Palestine Liberation Organization identified with the Soviet bloc and depended heavily on Moscow during the Cold War. Abbas was one of many Palestinian operatives who were educated in Russia, where he wrote a doctoral thesis trying to link Zionism to the Nazis and denying the extent of the Holocaust. That he subsequently did some part-time post-graduate information gathering -- and was, by no small coincidence, run by an intelligence operative named Mikhail Bogdanov who is now fellow former KGB veteran Vladimir Putin's envoy to the Middle East -- as a way of paying off his debt to his hosts was hardly surprising.\n\nIsraelis have known about his Holocaust denial since Abbas first came to prominence after the Oslo Accords as Arafat's top deputy and eventual successor. It's also no secret that Abbas was one of the planners and financiers of the 1972 Olympic Munich massacre. If that didn't stop Israeli governments from not only trying to persuade him to make peace but to actively protect him from Hamas, why does anyone think Israelis would care about him gathering information for the Soviets?\n\nNor does the publicizing of this information give the Israeli government any edge over Abbas in talks about the negotiations (that refuses to restart). If the PA leader were to confound observers and summon up the courage to embrace peace and recognize the legitimacy of a Jewish state no matter its borders, then nothing in his past would prevent him from obtaining extensive concessions from the current Israeli government or any possible successor.\n\nIt's possible that Abbas and his Fatah party are worried that this reminder of his past will give a boost to their Hamas rivals. Hamas is contesting the local elections in the West Bank scheduled to be held on Oct. 8. Fatah might worry that Abbas's Soviet ties undermine their efforts to compete with the rulers of Gaza for the title of Palestinian defender of Islam.\n\nApologists for Abbas will likely argue that the Palestinians had no choice but to accept Soviet help during a period when they had few other friends. That's true, but the connection with the anti-Semitic Soviet leadership was always more than an alliance of convenience for men like Arafat and Abbas. Moscow was interested in using the Palestinians to undermine the U.S. and its Israeli ally and didn't care if that meant subsidizing a movement dedicated to terrorist violence against Jews.\n\nBut the rejectionism of the Palestinians wasn't merely a strategy but an expression of their identity. Their national purpose was and still is inextricably linked to their century-old war against the Zionists. If men like Abbas can't rise above their sordid past and make peace, it is not just a matter of habit, but also a natural consequence of the political culture steeped in hate that they have helped create.\n\nBeing a former Soviet agent doesn't prevent Abbas from making peace. But it does supply a partial explanation for why he refuses to do it.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 2Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nWhat's worse: the politician who profits from contributions from those seeking to gain an advantage or the businessman who offers benefits that resemble bribes? That's one of the key questions voters must answer this year in a presidential contest that offers a pair of unsatisfactory choices. The election is still Hillary Clinton's to lose, but if Donald Trump still has a shot at winning -- and recent polls say as much -- it is because a great many Americans are not as angry about the smart aleck who can game the system as they are about the political establishment.\n\nThis dilemma is highlighted by the latest front page New York Times article, which seeks to flesh out the unsavory details about Donald Trump's business career. This one focuses on the well-timed $25,000 contribution the Donald made to the re-election campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013. The donation (and a subsequent fundraiser for her that was held at Trump's Mar A-lago resort) arrived not long before her office decided not to join fraud litigation being pursued against Trump University by the state of New York.\n\nThat would sound suspicious no matter who was doling out the payola, but coming from Trump, it's hard to accept the claims from Bondi and Trump's campaign about it all being an innocent coincidence. Trump is, as the Times recalls, a man who had been fined for illegal campaign contributions and lobbying. He has testified under oath about his massive donations to New York politicians from whom he sought favors. He's also the guy who has openly boasted in books and speeches about his ability to use his wealth to get what he needs from a system he says is \"rigged.\"\n\nThe contribution to Bondi has gotten attention not so much because it was illegal but because it was sloppy. The money came from the Republican candidate's non-profit foundation rather than an account that could make political contributions, and it resulted in another fine for Trump. But like most of his past efforts, it worked. Florida passed on the opportunity to join the suit against the Trump University scam as did other states -- like Texas and California -- whose attorneys general also got generous help from Trump. He may not always pay vendors who provide services to his companies, but he appears to get his money's worth from public servants.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this story, and the many others like it, is that it is not having the effect on his campaign that you might have thought it would. While people who are already opposed to Trump view his scams with disgust, the many who support him don't seem to care much. Indeed, while Trump is still likely to lose in November, stories like the Bondi bribe probably won't be the reason.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe first and most obvious reason is that this is an election that pits the proprietor of Trump University against one of the principals at the Clinton Foundation and the owner of the world's most famous home-brew email server. Clinton's reputation has driven her unfavorable poll ratings to the same stratospheric levels as those of Trump and earned her even worse numbers for being honest and trustworthy.\n\nBut his good fortune goes beyond the lack of a competitor with a pristine reputation. Trump's GOP primary competitors did not have reputations for lying that could compare to Clinton's, and they did their best to highlight Trump's problems. But Trump triumphed because he could denounce the political system that most of them were part of, portraying himself as someone who had transgressed but now saw the light.\n\nAmericans may not be as religious as they once were but they still love a redeemed sinner, and that's what Trump's pose promises. Some may find irony in the moral equivalent of a drunk running on a sobriety platform. But Trump claims that his past ability to work the angles gives him a unique ability to fix it, and that resonates with a lot of voters.\n\nAmericans may actually have a sneaking admiration for the person who is an expert at finagling, but they regard those on the inside -- especially those like the Clintons, who entered politics with little money but are now fabulously wealthy -- with far more anger. If stories like the one about Bondi don't sink Trump it's because many voters, if not most, are answering my question by saying that they think the bribed politician is a lot worse than the person offering them cash.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co.

Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view.

Max Boot 2016-09-07 Max Boot / Sept. 7, 2016 16Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe White House is sensitive to charges that the president is conducting an \"apology tour\" of the world. And it's true that on Tuesday the president didn't actually apologize in Laos for American actions in the 1960s, but he danced right up to the line.\n\nThis is what he said:\n\nOver nine years -- from 1964 to 1973 -- the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs here in Laos -- more than we dropped on Germany and Japan combined during all of World War II. It made Laos, per person, the most heavily bombed country in history. As one Laotian said, the 'bombs fell like rain.' Villages and entire valleys were obliterated. The ancient Plain of Jars was devastated. Countless civilians were killed. And that conflict was another reminder that, whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts a terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children. Today, I stand with you in acknowledging the suffering and sacrifices on all sides of that conflict.\n\nHe went on to pledge to double U.S. funding, to $90 million a year, to help Laos defuse bombs dropped during the Vietnam War. The problem is a very real one, as I discovered for myself while visiting Laos's Plain of Jars a few months ago -- a tourist site but one where tourists are still warned to look out for unexploded ordnance. Everything Obama said was factual, and there is nothing wrong with his desire to aid Laos -- the U.S. needs as many friends on China's borders as it can find. But his rhetoric was nevertheless one-sided and disappointing.\n\nWhat was lacking, above all, was any context. Someone who listened to Obama's speech and knew nothing of Laos's history would have been left mystified about why the U.S. dropped bombs \"like rain\" on that country. Did Americans harbor irrational fear and prejudice of Laotians? Were the Johnson and Nixon administrations motivated by racial prejudice? Perhaps they were simply staffed by psychopaths and war criminals who enjoyed annihilating small countries?\n\nHardly.\n\nWhat Obama did not mention was that in 1959, preparatory to its invasion of South Vietnam, North Vietnam invaded Laos in order to establish a major segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail bringing weapons, supplies, and manpower from North to South. North Vietnam also sponsored and supported with its own troops a Communist insurgency, the Pathet Lao, to overthrow the Royal Government of Laos. The U.S. responded to this Communist aggression -- conducted in violation of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962 -- by providing covert and overt aid to the government of Laos and to Hmong militias who were fighting the Communists. Unlike in South Vietnam, the U.S. did not send combat troops to Laos; instead it relied on the CIA and the Special Forces to fight a \"secret war\" utilizing Laotians who were determined to resist Communist domination. The most capable American-supported leader was Vang Pao, a Hmong tribesman who was a general in the Lao army. Eventually he led as many as 40,000 guerrillas fighting the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese Army.\n\nThe U.S. bombing of Laos was conducted in support of Vang Pao and other anti-Communist fighters and as part of a general effort to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- the logistics line that enabled aggression against a sovereign state allied with the United States. Those interested in learning more should read my colleague Joshua Kurlantzick's excellent forthcoming book A Great Place to Have a War: America in Laos and the Birth of a Military CIA (out in January from Simon & Schuster).\n\nIt is certainly possible to question the utility and even the morality of U.S. bombing in Laos -- but it is highly misleading for any analyst, much less the president of the United States, to criticize the U.S. in a vacuum without noting the actions of the North Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao who killed countless numbers of Laotian civilians, violated Laotian sovereignty, and ultimately overthrew the internationally recognized government of Laos in order to impose a Communist dictatorship. That dictatorship continues to rule to this day, by the way. It has made some economic reforms primarily to encourage tourism, but it remains a dictatorship that is rated \"not free\" by Freedom House.\n\nTo his credit, Obama did speak out about human rights during his trip although in a particularly mealy-mouthed way. He never directly criticized Laos's human-rights record, which is poor. He never highlighted the plight of dissidents or called for democracy. Instead he spoke in oblique terms about the importance of human rights while making clear that they are not very crucial in the U.S.-Laos relationship: \"As we do around the world, the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of what we consider universal human rights, including the rights of the people of Laos to express yourselves freely and decide your own future. Yet even as our governments deal candidly with our differences, I believe, as we have shown from Cuba to Burma to Vietnam, the best way to deliver progress for all of our peoples is by closer cooperation between our countries. And that's why, today, the United States and Laos have agreed to a new comprehensive partnership to guide and deepen our relationship for years to come.\" In other words, while saying he would speak out on behalf of human rights, Obama did not really do that.\n\nI get what Obama is up to here. He thinks the U.S. can exercise more influence today by acknowledging past \"misconduct\" without directly criticizing the behavior of countries it deals with. The problem is that, in practice, this amounts to kow-towing to dictators from Cuba to Iran and buying into their fiction that the U.S. is guilty of conduct just as bad, if not worse, than what they have done. That simply isn't true, and by shading the truth the president is failing to speak on behalf of the principles upon which the United States was founded-and which have long been our most powerful tool and selling point in international affairs. He is also inadvertently buttressing the dictatorships he is dealing with; now they can turn to their people and say in essence, \"Our problems are America's fault-the president of the United States even said so.\" What we have seen during the two terms of the Obama presidency is that by failing to speak out more robustly on behalf of freedom, the president is not winning any friends; he is simply convincing the world's dictators that he is a patsy who can be pushed around with impunity.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 10Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nDonald Trump is many things but subtle isn't one of them. While campaigning in Ohio yesterday, he said that Iran \"is going to destroy Israel unless I get elected.\" But if he wins, \"then Israel will be just fine.\" That's a pretty simple formulation and it's one that some friends of the Jewish state are buying. Are they right?\n\nThe basic premise of this apocalyptic argument is that the nuclear deal the Obama administration struck with Iran poses an existential threat to the state of Israel. Trump is right about that. The deal makes an Iranian bomb possible in the long term while also enriching the regime and strengthening its ability to support terror and harass Israel via its Hezbollah auxiliaries and Hamas allies.\n\nThe question is, what can Trump do about it? Or at least what would he do that Hillary Clinton won't?\n\nThe first advantage Trump has is that he enters the Iran debate with clean hands, having never supported President Obama's goal of rapprochement with Tehran. The same cannot be said of Clinton. No, the deal didn't happen on Clinton's watch and it might not have come to pass had she not been replaced by John Kerry at the State Department since he ardent supporter of Obama's approach on Iran. But she still supported the negotiations and the dismal final result.\n\nClinton says she will zealously enforce the terms of the deal and has made noises -- while keeping as little daylight between herself and President Obama as possible for the purposes of the campaign -- about getting tougher on Iranian behavior in the region.\n\nIn contrast to most of the other Republican presidential candidates, Trump never said he would tear up the deal. He has merely held it up as a terrible negotiation in which the U.S. gave up its goals and got little in return. The assumption is that somehow he will attempt to renegotiate or re-impose sanctions to get better terms. But since America's European allies will never go along with such a scenario, short of war, that isn't going to happen. So other than a more robust rhetorical approach to Iran, it's not clear what functional difference there will be between his Iran policy and that of Clinton.\n\nBut for all of his justified criticism of the nuclear deal, the rest of Trump's foreign and Middle East policy hints at a less contentious approach to Iran.\n\nAs Trump said in his security-policy speech delivered today in Philadelphia, he will \"work with any country\" provided they are willing to cooperate in the struggle against ISIS. While specifically eschewing regime change in any country in the region, he said \"new friendships and partnerships\" would be pursued in \"this mission.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means that Trump is interested in cooperating with Russia and, since he wants the U.S. to shoulder as little responsibility for Middle East security as possible, he seems just as willing as Obama to allow Vladimir Putin a free hand in Syria and other trouble spots. And because Russia is in business with Iran in their joint effort to preserve the Assad regime in Syria a Trump administration would appear to be pursuing the same strategic goals as Obama. Given Trump's disdain for efforts to overturn the theocratic dictatorship in Tehran and his general opposition to U.S. military interventions, friends of the Jewish state may be forgiven for dismissing all this talk about preventing Israel's destruction as mere rhetoric.\n\nPro-Israel advocates would do well to be just as skeptical of Clinton's claims as a champion of Israel. We don't know whether Trump would pursue renewed negotiations with the Palestinians or pressure Israel to help him create a peace deal. He is probably less interested, however, in a continuation of the same failed policies pursued by both the Clinton and the Obama administration. But if you're judging the two candidates on their ability to enable Israel to survive the threat from Iran, Trump's case seems less impressive in the context of his advocacy for more \"realism\" -- a word that has always been synonymous with policies that are hostile to Israeli security. Moreover, Israelis know better than to rest their safety on anything other than their own strength.\n\nPut simply, Trump's goals are mutually exclusive. The U.S. can't abandon the region while simultaneously enhancing Israel's security. And no matter how magical your negotiating skills might be, you can't have better relations with Russia and work with Iran against ISIS while also pursuing a tougher policy against the latter's nuclear program.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 4Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday's CNN/ORC poll was a thunderbolt that hit the Clinton campaign right between the eyes. Not only did the survey have Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton for the first time in the race, it also showed her surpassing Trump's already historically high negatives. If that wasn't bad enough, 50 percent of those polled expressed confidence in the GOP candidate's trustworthiness and honesty while only 35 percent would say the same for Clinton. If, as I noted, these results are repeated in other polls, it will be seen as a turning point in the race. But figuring out whether this is a harbinger of a reversal or a mere statistical outlier depends on your ideas about who will be voting in November.\n\nAs Chuck Todd pointed out on MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily yesterday, CNN's poll should be viewed with skepticism because of the sample on which it is based. The population polled by CNN had four percentage points more voters that identified as Republicans than Democrats. More than half of them were whites without a college degree. If that is what the electorate looks like in November then Trump will be poised to win or at least come close.\n\nBut that electorate looks nothing like the one that went to the polls in 2012, when only about a third of voters were whites without college degrees and Democrats enjoyed a clear edge. So if you adjust CNN's results for a population that looks more like 2012, Clinton takes the lead by four points. Such a result would still reflect a marked decline in voter trust for Clinton as the drip-drip-drip of stories that highlight her lies about the email scandal continues. Though she may be dropping in the polls, the demographic advantages that the Democrats have carried into the fall among female, minority, and young voters are still there.\n\nIf this kind of argument about sample proportions sounds familiar, it should. As I noted in June, Mitt Romney and his supporters had claimed the 2012 polls showing Barack Obama winning were wrong because the samples were too Democratic. I made the same mistake at the time, reasoning that there was no way the electorate would skew as heavily toward minorities and Democrats as it had in 2008. Romney was wrong and so was I. It turned out that, if anything, the polls had underestimated the number of Democrats who would turn out to vote.\n\nSince then, many on the right have claimed that there were millions of missing conservative white voters who stayed home in 2012 rather than cast an unenthusiastic ballot for a moderate like Romney. There isn't much evidence to support this theory, but in order to imagine a Trump victory you'd need a 2016 turnout model composed of more whites (and with those whites being skewed toward those without a college degree) than the one that re-elected Obama in 2012.\n\nSuch a scenario is not impossible. Like most voters this year, Democrats are unenthusiastic about their choices. Clinton hasn't the appeal among minorities that the first African-American president did. If Trump wins white voters by a greater percentage than Romney did and if minority turnout doesn't increase or actually goes down, then the billionaire can win.\n\nThis would be historic, but it is also unlikely. It is hard to imagine why the fastest growing demographic sectors (particularly Hispanics) would not continue to increase their share of the vote, especially since animosity for Trump seems to be a stand-in for enthusiasm for Obama as an incentive for minorities to turn out. And since Trump is losing among college-educated whites -- a group Romney won by double digits -- the prospect of the GOP getting a higher share of the white vote requires the miraculous appearance of those missing millions of white working-class voters who have never voted and who may not actually exist.\n\nBoth sides dismiss unfavorable polls and laud those who tell them what they want to hear. But unless Trump's presence on the ballot can transform the electorate into something that doesn't seem to exist, his supporters' optimism is unfounded.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure.

The election is still Hillary Clinton's to lose, but if Donald Trump still has a shot at winning -- and recent polls say as much -- it is because a great many Americans are not as angry about the smart aleck who can game the system as they are about the political establishment.\n\nThis dilemma is highlighted by the latest front page New York Times article, which seeks to flesh out the unsavory details about Donald Trump's business career. This one focuses on the well-timed $25,000 contribution the Donald made to the re-election campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013. The donation (and a subsequent fundraiser for her that was held at Trump's Mar A-lago resort) arrived not long before her office decided not to join fraud litigation being pursued against Trump University by the state of New York.\n\nThat would sound suspicious no matter who was doling out the payola, but coming from Trump, it's hard to accept the claims from Bondi and Trump's campaign about it all being an innocent coincidence. Trump is, as the Times recalls, a man who had been fined for illegal campaign contributions and lobbying. He has testified under oath about his massive donations to New York politicians from whom he sought favors. He's also the guy who has openly boasted in books and speeches about his ability to use his wealth to get what he needs from a system he says is \"rigged.\"\n\nThe contribution to Bondi has gotten attention not so much because it was illegal but because it was sloppy. The money came from the Republican candidate's non-profit foundation rather than an account that could make political contributions, and it resulted in another fine for Trump. But like most of his past efforts, it worked. Florida passed on the opportunity to join the suit against the Trump University scam as did other states -- like Texas and California -- whose attorneys general also got generous help from Trump. He may not always pay vendors who provide services to his companies, but he appears to get his money's worth from public servants.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this story, and the many others like it, is that it is not having the effect on his campaign that you might have thought it would. While people who are already opposed to Trump view his scams with disgust, the many who support him don't seem to care much. Indeed, while Trump is still likely to lose in November, stories like the Bondi bribe probably won't be the reason.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe first and most obvious reason is that this is an election that pits the proprietor of Trump University against one of the principals at the Clinton Foundation and the owner of the world's most famous home-brew email server. Clinton's reputation has driven her unfavorable poll ratings to the same stratospheric levels as those of Trump and earned her even worse numbers for being honest and trustworthy.\n\nBut his good fortune goes beyond the lack of a competitor with a pristine reputation. Trump's GOP primary competitors did not have reputations for lying that could compare to Clinton's, and they did their best to highlight Trump's problems. But Trump triumphed because he could denounce the political system that most of them were part of, portraying himself as someone who had transgressed but now saw the light.\n\nAmericans may not be as religious as they once were but they still love a redeemed sinner, and that's what Trump's pose promises. Some may find irony in the moral equivalent of a drunk running on a sobriety platform. But Trump claims that his past ability to work the angles gives him a unique ability to fix it, and that resonates with a lot of voters.\n\nAmericans may actually have a sneaking admiration for the person who is an expert at finagling, but they regard those on the inside -- especially those like the Clintons, who entered politics with little money but are now fabulously wealthy -- with far more anger. If stories like the one about Bondi don't sink Trump it's because many voters, if not most, are answering my question by saying that they think the bribed politician is a lot worse than the person offering them cash.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience.

It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later.

It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack.

So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always.

There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY!

That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small.

Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Max Boot 2016-09-07 Max Boot / Sept. 7, 2016 7Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe White House is sensitive to charges that the president is conducting an \"apology tour\" of the world. And it's true that on Tuesday the president didn't actually apologize in Laos for American actions in the 1960s, but he danced right up to the line.\n\nThis is what he said:\n\nOver nine years -- from 1964 to 1973 -- the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs here in Laos -- more than we dropped on Germany and Japan combined during all of World War II. It made Laos, per person, the most heavily bombed country in history. As one Laotian said, the 'bombs fell like rain.' Villages and entire valleys were obliterated. The ancient Plain of Jars was devastated. Countless civilians were killed. And that conflict was another reminder that, whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts a terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children. Today, I stand with you in acknowledging the suffering and sacrifices on all sides of that conflict.\n\nHe went on to pledge to double U.S. funding, to $90 million a year, to help Laos defuse bombs dropped during the Vietnam War. The problem is a very real one, as I discovered for myself while visiting Laos's Plain of Jars a few months ago -- a tourist site but one where tourists are still warned to look out for unexploded ordnance. Everything Obama said was factual, and there is nothing wrong with his desire to aid Laos -- the U.S. needs as many friends on China's borders as it can find. But his rhetoric was nevertheless one-sided and disappointing.\n\nWhat was lacking, above all, was any context. Someone who listened to Obama's speech and knew nothing of Laos's history would have been left mystified about why the U.S. dropped bombs \"like rain\" on that country. Did Americans harbor irrational fear and prejudice of Laotians? Were the Johnson and Nixon administrations motivated by racial prejudice? Perhaps they were simply staffed by psychopaths and war criminals who enjoyed annihilating small countries?\n\nHardly.\n\nWhat Obama did not mention was that in 1959, preparatory to its invasion of South Vietnam, North Vietnam invaded Laos in order to establish a major segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail bringing weapons, supplies, and manpower from North to South. North Vietnam also sponsored and supported with its own troops a Communist insurgency, the Pathet Lao, to overthrow the Royal Government of Laos. The U.S. responded to this Communist aggression -- conducted in violation of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962 -- by providing covert and overt aid to the government of Laos and to Hmong militias who were fighting the Communists. Unlike in South Vietnam, the U.S. did not send combat troops to Laos; instead it relied on the CIA and the Special Forces to fight a \"secret war\" utilizing Laotians who were determined to resist Communist domination. The most capable American-supported leader was Vang Pao, a Hmong tribesman who was a general in the Lao army. Eventually he led as many as 40,000 guerrillas fighting the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese Army.\n\nThe U.S. bombing of Laos was conducted in support of Vang Pao and other anti-Communist fighters and as part of a general effort to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- the logistics line that enabled aggression against a sovereign state allied with the United States. Those interested in learning more should read my colleague Joshua Kurlantzick's excellent forthcoming book A Great Place to Have a War: America in Laos and the Birth of a Military CIA (out in January from Simon & Schuster).\n\nIt is certainly possible to question the utility and even the morality of U.S. bombing in Laos -- but it is highly misleading for any analyst, much less the president of the United States, to criticize the U.S. in a vacuum without noting the actions of the North Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao who killed countless numbers of Laotian civilians, violated Laotian sovereignty, and ultimately overthrew the internationally recognized government of Laos in order to impose a Communist dictatorship. That dictatorship continues to rule to this day, by the way. It has made some economic reforms primarily to encourage tourism, but it remains a dictatorship that is rated \"not free\" by Freedom House.\n\nTo his credit, Obama did speak out about human rights during his trip although in a particularly mealy-mouthed way. He never directly criticized Laos's human-rights record, which is poor. He never highlighted the plight of dissidents or called for democracy. Instead he spoke in oblique terms about the importance of human rights while making clear that they are not very crucial in the U.S.-Laos relationship: \"As we do around the world, the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of what we consider universal human rights, including the rights of the people of Laos to express yourselves freely and decide your own future. Yet even as our governments deal candidly with our differences, I believe, as we have shown from Cuba to Burma to Vietnam, the best way to deliver progress for all of our peoples is by closer cooperation between our countries. And that's why, today, the United States and Laos have agreed to a new comprehensive partnership to guide and deepen our relationship for years to come.\" In other words, while saying he would speak out on behalf of human rights, Obama did not really do that.\n\nI get what Obama is up to here. He thinks the U.S. can exercise more influence today by acknowledging past \"misconduct\" without directly criticizing the behavior of countries it deals with. The problem is that, in practice, this amounts to kow-towing to dictators from Cuba to Iran and buying into their fiction that the U.S. is guilty of conduct just as bad, if not worse, than what they have done. That simply isn't true, and by shading the truth the president is failing to speak on behalf of the principles upon which the United States was founded-and which have long been our most powerful tool and selling point in international affairs. He is also inadvertently buttressing the dictatorships he is dealing with; now they can turn to their people and say in essence, \"Our problems are America's fault-the president of the United States even said so.\" What we have seen during the two terms of the Obama presidency is that by failing to speak out more robustly on behalf of freedom, the president is not winning any friends; he is simply convincing the world's dictators that he is a patsy who can be pushed around with impunity.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view.

Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 1Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nDonald Trump is many things but subtle isn't one of them. While campaigning in Ohio yesterday, he said that Iran \"is going to destroy Israel unless I get elected.\" But if he wins, \"then Israel will be just fine.\" That's a pretty simple formulation and it's one that some friends of the Jewish state are buying. Are they right?\n\nThe basic premise of this apocalyptic argument is that the nuclear deal the Obama administration struck with Iran poses an existential threat to the state of Israel. Trump is right about that. The deal makes an Iranian bomb possible in the long term while also enriching the regime and strengthening its ability to support terror and harass Israel via its Hezbollah auxiliaries and Hamas allies.\n\nThe question is, what can Trump do about it? Or at least what would he do that Hillary Clinton won't?\n\nThe first advantage Trump has is that he enters the Iran debate with clean hands, having never supported President Obama's goal of rapprochement with Tehran. The same cannot be said of Clinton. No, the deal didn't happen on Clinton's watch and it might not have come to pass had she not been replaced by John Kerry at the State Department since he ardent supporter of Obama's approach on Iran. But she still supported the negotiations and the dismal final result.\n\nClinton says she will zealously enforce the terms of the deal and has made noises -- while keeping as little daylight between herself and President Obama as possible for the purposes of the campaign -- about getting tougher on Iranian behavior in the region.\n\nIn contrast to most of the other Republican presidential candidates, Trump never said he would tear up the deal. He has merely held it up as a terrible negotiation in which the U.S. gave up its goals and got little in return. The assumption is that somehow he will attempt to renegotiate or re-impose sanctions to get better terms. But since America's European allies will never go along with such a scenario, short of war, that isn't going to happen. So other than a more robust rhetorical approach to Iran, it's not clear what functional difference there will be between his Iran policy and that of Clinton.\n\nBut for all of his justified criticism of the nuclear deal, the rest of Trump's foreign and Middle East policy hints at a less contentious approach to Iran.\n\nAs Trump said in his security-policy speech delivered today in Philadelphia, he will \"work with any country\" provided they are willing to cooperate in the struggle against ISIS. While specifically eschewing regime change in any country in the region, he said \"new friendships and partnerships\" would be pursued in \"this mission.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means that Trump is interested in cooperating with Russia and, since he wants the U.S. to shoulder as little responsibility for Middle East security as possible, he seems just as willing as Obama to allow Vladimir Putin a free hand in Syria and other trouble spots. And because Russia is in business with Iran in their joint effort to preserve the Assad regime in Syria a Trump administration would appear to be pursuing the same strategic goals as Obama. Given Trump's disdain for efforts to overturn the theocratic dictatorship in Tehran and his general opposition to U.S. military interventions, friends of the Jewish state may be forgiven for dismissing all this talk about preventing Israel's destruction as mere rhetoric.\n\nPro-Israel advocates would do well to be just as skeptical of Clinton's claims as a champion of Israel. We don't know whether Trump would pursue renewed negotiations with the Palestinians or pressure Israel to help him create a peace deal. He is probably less interested, however, in a continuation of the same failed policies pursued by both the Clinton and the Obama administration. But if you're judging the two candidates on their ability to enable Israel to survive the threat from Iran, Trump's case seems less impressive in the context of his advocacy for more \"realism\" -- a word that has always been synonymous with policies that are hostile to Israeli security. Moreover, Israelis know better than to rest their safety on anything other than their own strength.\n\nPut simply, Trump's goals are mutually exclusive. The U.S. can't abandon the region while simultaneously enhancing Israel's security. And no matter how magical your negotiating skills might be, you can't have better relations with Russia and work with Iran against ISIS while also pursuing a tougher policy against the latter's nuclear program.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 2Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday's CNN/ORC poll was a thunderbolt that hit the Clinton campaign right between the eyes. Not only did the survey have Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton for the first time in the race, it also showed her surpassing Trump's already historically high negatives. If that wasn't bad enough, 50 percent of those polled expressed confidence in the GOP candidate's trustworthiness and honesty while only 35 percent would say the same for Clinton. If, as I noted, these results are repeated in other polls, it will be seen as a turning point in the race. But figuring out whether this is a harbinger of a reversal or a mere statistical outlier depends on your ideas about who will be voting in November.\n\nAs Chuck Todd pointed out on MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily yesterday, CNN's poll should be viewed with skepticism because of the sample on which it is based. The population polled by CNN had four percentage points more voters that identified as Republicans than Democrats. More than half of them were whites without a college degree. If that is what the electorate looks like in November then Trump will be poised to win or at least come close.\n\nBut that electorate looks nothing like the one that went to the polls in 2012, when only about a third of voters were whites without college degrees and Democrats enjoyed a clear edge. So if you adjust CNN's results for a population that looks more like 2012, Clinton takes the lead by four points. Such a result would still reflect a marked decline in voter trust for Clinton as the drip-drip-drip of stories that highlight her lies about the email scandal continues. Though she may be dropping in the polls, the demographic advantages that the Democrats have carried into the fall among female, minority, and young voters are still there.\n\nIf this kind of argument about sample proportions sounds familiar, it should. As I noted in June, Mitt Romney and his supporters had claimed the 2012 polls showing Barack Obama winning were wrong because the samples were too Democratic. I made the same mistake at the time, reasoning that there was no way the electorate would skew as heavily toward minorities and Democrats as it had in 2008. Romney was wrong and so was I. It turned out that, if anything, the polls had underestimated the number of Democrats who would turn out to vote.\n\nSince then, many on the right have claimed that there were millions of missing conservative white voters who stayed home in 2012 rather than cast an unenthusiastic ballot for a moderate like Romney. There isn't much evidence to support this theory, but in order to imagine a Trump victory you'd need a 2016 turnout model composed of more whites (and with those whites being skewed toward those without a college degree) than the one that re-elected Obama in 2012.\n\nSuch a scenario is not impossible. Like most voters this year, Democrats are unenthusiastic about their choices. Clinton hasn't the appeal among minorities that the first African-American president did. If Trump wins white voters by a greater percentage than Romney did and if minority turnout doesn't increase or actually goes down, then the billionaire can win.\n\nThis would be historic, but it is also unlikely. It is hard to imagine why the fastest growing demographic sectors (particularly Hispanics) would not continue to increase their share of the vote, especially since animosity for Trump seems to be a stand-in for enthusiasm for Obama as an incentive for minorities to turn out. And since Trump is losing among college-educated whites -- a group Romney won by double digits -- the prospect of the GOP getting a higher share of the white vote requires the miraculous appearance of those missing millions of white working-class voters who have never voted and who may not actually exist.\n\nBoth sides dismiss unfavorable polls and laud those who tell them what they want to hear. But unless Trump's presence on the ballot can transform the electorate into something that doesn't seem to exist, his supporters' optimism is unfounded.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nA month ago, Donald Trump openly declared that he believed the election would be rigged against him. But now Trump and his followers aren't the only ones worrying about the integrity of the election. The Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee raises serious questions about just how far Moscow would go to help Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton because of Trump's open advocacy of appeasement of the Vladimir Putin regime. Add to that other legitimate concerns that have been discussed in the media about the security of electronic voting and reporting systems and you've got the makings of a terrible controversy if, as today's national polls indicate, the presidential election turns out to be close.\n\nTrump's talk of a rigged election fit in neatly with his dark vision of America as a corrupt nation in decline. For those who truly believe the country is on the verge of collapse, it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to think the system's malignant puppeteers will stop at nothing to prevent the Trump revolution. For months, Trump's alt-right cheering section at Breitbart and elsewhere on the Internet have been stoking his followers' fears that their hero would be cheated of the presidency. That's why some tortured souls imagine President Obama will either suspend elections or somehow thwart the will of \"we the people\" this fall.\n\nThat's crazy stuff, but given the fact that American popular culture has been endlessly feeding audiences such paranoid scenarios in films and TV shows since the 1960s, why should we be surprised if some people -- on both the left and the right -- are ready to buy into the notion that life will somehow imitate art in 2016?\n\nBut while, as our Max Boot correctly stated yesterday, the Obama administration must send a strong message to Russia to make them understand we won't tolerate any interference, we must at the same time recognize that there's nothing new about fears of cheating in American politics.\n\nOne of the most disingenuous arguments that Democrats have used against voter ID laws is that there is no such thing as voter fraud. In order to accept this claim, you'd have to forget much of American political history as well as everything we know about human nature. Attempts to rig elections are as old as the republic itself. Most pundits rightly disparaged Trump's comments about rigged elections. But the fact that they were uttered in Pennsylvania stems from by no means from unreasonable Republican allegations that Democrats have been using their minority voter stronghold in Philadelphia to pad their totals.\n\nBut let's also remember that the left has its own myths about cheating. Many Democrats remain convinced the 2000 election was stolen in Florida even if the evidence showed that Bush actually won the state, albeit because of a confusing ballot in one county that Republicans had no hand in creating. Liberals also made misleading claims about electronic voting machines being rigged to help Bush in 2004 and about his win in Ohio being the result of illegal manipulation.\n\nThese disputes are only remembered if the outcome of an election is close. Every time a presidential election is won by a narrow margin, claims of fraud arise. More to the point, those charges have special resonance when the two parties view each other's candidates as illegitimate. The Internet and social media have made this worse.\n\nIf worries about fraud are louder than ever this year it is because we have the two most unpopular presidential candidates in our modern history. Many Americans think Trump to be not merely wrong but unfit for the presidency. As the most recent polls demonstrate, just as many feel the same way about Hillary Clinton. No matter who prevails, the winner is going to be considered illegitimate by much of the country. Republicans may have thought John Kennedy's camp stole the 1960 election and some Democrats may have thought the same thing about Bush in 2000 and 2004. But those arguments will be nothing when compared to what will greet the election of either Trump or Clinton this year if the result is close.\n\nWhether or not the Russians do their worst or any other bad actor tries to cook the results, those who care about democracy must hope for a decisive win by either side. Anything else will only feed the perfect storm of paranoia and cynicism that has migrated from the fever swamps of American politics to the mainstream in recent years.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:Donald TrumpRussian hackingVoter fraud0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",

We wonder at Donald Trump's insistence on enlarging a military he does not wish to use, and wonder how he can reconcile all that with his promise to destroy ISIS. And we do not forget how the president was dissed in Asia.

Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness.

Max Boot 2016-09-07 Max Boot / Sept. 7, 2016 4Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe White House is sensitive to charges that the president is conducting an \"apology tour\" of the world. And it's true that on Tuesday the president didn't actually apologize in Laos for American actions in the 1960s, but he danced right up to the line.\n\nThis is what he said:\n\nOver nine years -- from 1964 to 1973 -- the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs here in Laos -- more than we dropped on Germany and Japan combined during all of World War II. It made Laos, per person, the most heavily bombed country in history. As one Laotian said, the 'bombs fell like rain.' Villages and entire valleys were obliterated. The ancient Plain of Jars was devastated. Countless civilians were killed. And that conflict was another reminder that, whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts a terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children. Today, I stand with you in acknowledging the suffering and sacrifices on all sides of that conflict.\n\nHe went on to pledge to double U.S. funding, to $90 million a year, to help Laos defuse bombs dropped during the Vietnam War. The problem is a very real one, as I discovered for myself while visiting Laos's Plain of Jars a few months ago -- a tourist site but one where tourists are still warned to look out for unexploded ordnance. Everything Obama said was factual, and there is nothing wrong with his desire to aid Laos -- the U.S. needs as many friends on China's borders as it can find. But his rhetoric was nevertheless one-sided and disappointing.\n\nWhat was lacking, above all, was any context. Someone who listened to Obama's speech and knew nothing of Laos's history would have been left mystified about why the U.S. dropped bombs \"like rain\" on that country. Did Americans harbor irrational fear and prejudice of Laotians? Were the Johnson and Nixon administrations motivated by racial prejudice? Perhaps they were simply staffed by psychopaths and war criminals who enjoyed annihilating small countries?\n\nHardly.\n\nWhat Obama did not mention was that in 1959, preparatory to its invasion of South Vietnam, North Vietnam invaded Laos in order to establish a major segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail bringing weapons, supplies, and manpower from North to South. North Vietnam also sponsored and supported with its own troops a Communist insurgency, the Pathet Lao, to overthrow the Royal Government of Laos. The U.S. responded to this Communist aggression -- conducted in violation of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962 -- by providing covert and overt aid to the government of Laos and to Hmong militias who were fighting the Communists. Unlike in South Vietnam, the U.S. did not send combat troops to Laos; instead it relied on the CIA and the Special Forces to fight a \"secret war\" utilizing Laotians who were determined to resist Communist domination. The most capable American-supported leader was Vang Pao, a Hmong tribesman who was a general in the Lao army. Eventually he led as many as 40,000 guerrillas fighting the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese Army.\n\nThe U.S. bombing of Laos was conducted in support of Vang Pao and other anti-Communist fighters and as part of a general effort to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- the logistics line that enabled aggression against a sovereign state allied with the United States. Those interested in learning more should read my colleague Joshua Kurlantzick's excellent forthcoming book A Great Place to Have a War: America in Laos and the Birth of a Military CIA (out in January from Simon & Schuster).\n\nIt is certainly possible to question the utility and even the morality of U.S. bombing in Laos -- but it is highly misleading for any analyst, much less the president of the United States, to criticize the U.S. in a vacuum without noting the actions of the North Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao who killed countless numbers of Laotian civilians, violated Laotian sovereignty, and ultimately overthrew the internationally recognized government of Laos in order to impose a Communist dictatorship. That dictatorship continues to rule to this day, by the way. It has made some economic reforms primarily to encourage tourism, but it remains a dictatorship that is rated \"not free\" by Freedom House.\n\nTo his credit, Obama did speak out about human rights during his trip although in a particularly mealy-mouthed way. He never directly criticized Laos's human-rights record, which is poor. He never highlighted the plight of dissidents or called for democracy. Instead he spoke in oblique terms about the importance of human rights while making clear that they are not very crucial in the U.S.-Laos relationship: \"As we do around the world, the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of what we consider universal human rights, including the rights of the people of Laos to express yourselves freely and decide your own future. Yet even as our governments deal candidly with our differences, I believe, as we have shown from Cuba to Burma to Vietnam, the best way to deliver progress for all of our peoples is by closer cooperation between our countries. And that's why, today, the United States and Laos have agreed to a new comprehensive partnership to guide and deepen our relationship for years to come.\" In other words, while saying he would speak out on behalf of human rights, Obama did not really do that.\n\nI get what Obama is up to here. He thinks the U.S. can exercise more influence today by acknowledging past \"misconduct\" without directly criticizing the behavior of countries it deals with. The problem is that, in practice, this amounts to kow-towing to dictators from Cuba to Iran and buying into their fiction that the U.S. is guilty of conduct just as bad, if not worse, than what they have done. That simply isn't true, and by shading the truth the president is failing to speak on behalf of the principles upon which the United States was founded-and which have long been our most powerful tool and selling point in international affairs. He is also inadvertently buttressing the dictatorships he is dealing with; now they can turn to their people and say in essence, \"Our problems are America's fault-the president of the United States even said so.\" What we have seen during the two terms of the Obama presidency is that by failing to speak out more robustly on behalf of freedom, the president is not winning any friends; he is simply convincing the world's dictators that he is a patsy who can be pushed around with impunity.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 1Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nDonald Trump is many things but subtle isn't one of them. While campaigning in Ohio yesterday, he said that Iran \"is going to destroy Israel unless I get elected.\" But if he wins, \"then Israel will be just fine.\" That's a pretty simple formulation and it's one that some friends of the Jewish state are buying. Are they right?\n\nThe basic premise of this apocalyptic argument is that the nuclear deal the Obama administration struck with Iran poses an existential threat to the state of Israel. Trump is right about that. The deal makes an Iranian bomb possible in the long term while also enriching the regime and strengthening its ability to support terror and harass Israel via its Hezbollah auxiliaries and Hamas allies.\n\nThe question is, what can Trump do about it? Or at least what would he do that Hillary Clinton won't?\n\nThe first advantage Trump has is that he enters the Iran debate with clean hands, having never supported President Obama's goal of rapprochement with Tehran. The same cannot be said of Clinton. No, the deal didn't happen on Clinton's watch and it might not have come to pass had she not been replaced by John Kerry at the State Department since he ardent supporter of Obama's approach on Iran. But she still supported the negotiations and the dismal final result.\n\nClinton says she will zealously enforce the terms of the deal and has made noises -- while keeping as little daylight between herself and President Obama as possible for the purposes of the campaign -- about getting tougher on Iranian behavior in the region.\n\nIn contrast to most of the other Republican presidential candidates, Trump never said he would tear up the deal. He has merely held it up as a terrible negotiation in which the U.S. gave up its goals and got little in return. The assumption is that somehow he will attempt to renegotiate or re-impose sanctions to get better terms. But since America's European allies will never go along with such a scenario, short of war, that isn't going to happen. So other than a more robust rhetorical approach to Iran, it's not clear what functional difference there will be between his Iran policy and that of Clinton.\n\nBut for all of his justified criticism of the nuclear deal, the rest of Trump's foreign and Middle East policy hints at a less contentious approach to Iran.\n\nAs Trump said in his security-policy speech delivered today in Philadelphia, he will \"work with any country\" provided they are willing to cooperate in the struggle against ISIS. While specifically eschewing regime change in any country in the region, he said \"new friendships and partnerships\" would be pursued in \"this mission.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means that Trump is interested in cooperating with Russia and, since he wants the U.S. to shoulder as little responsibility for Middle East security as possible, he seems just as willing as Obama to allow Vladimir Putin a free hand in Syria and other trouble spots. And because Russia is in business with Iran in their joint effort to preserve the Assad regime in Syria a Trump administration would appear to be pursuing the same strategic goals as Obama. Given Trump's disdain for efforts to overturn the theocratic dictatorship in Tehran and his general opposition to U.S. military interventions, friends of the Jewish state may be forgiven for dismissing all this talk about preventing Israel's destruction as mere rhetoric.\n\nPro-Israel advocates would do well to be just as skeptical of Clinton's claims as a champion of Israel. We don't know whether Trump would pursue renewed negotiations with the Palestinians or pressure Israel to help him create a peace deal. He is probably less interested, however, in a continuation of the same failed policies pursued by both the Clinton and the Obama administration. But if you're judging the two candidates on their ability to enable Israel to survive the threat from Iran, Trump's case seems less impressive in the context of his advocacy for more \"realism\" -- a word that has always been synonymous with policies that are hostile to Israeli security. Moreover, Israelis know better than to rest their safety on anything other than their own strength.\n\nPut simply, Trump's goals are mutually exclusive. The U.S. can't abandon the region while simultaneously enhancing Israel's security. And no matter how magical your negotiating skills might be, you can't have better relations with Russia and work with Iran against ISIS while also pursuing a tougher policy against the latter's nuclear program.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:Donald TrumpIran nuclear dealIsrael1Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles: Campaigns & Elections Which Turnout Model is Realistic? Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 2Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday's CNN/ORC poll was a thunderbolt that hit the Clinton campaign right between the eyes. Not only did the survey have Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton for the first time in the race, it also showed her surpassing Trump's already historically high negatives. If that wasn't bad enough, 50 percent of those polled expressed confidence in the GOP candidate's trustworthiness and honesty while only 35 percent would say the same for Clinton. If, as I noted, these results are repeated in other polls, it will be seen as a turning point in the race. But figuring out whether this is a harbinger of a reversal or a mere statistical outlier depends on your ideas about who will be voting in November.\n\nAs Chuck Todd pointed out on MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily yesterday, CNN's poll should be viewed with skepticism because of the sample on which it is based. The population polled by CNN had four percentage points more voters that identified as Republicans than Democrats. More than half of them were whites without a college degree. If that is what the electorate looks like in November then Trump will be poised to win or at least come close.\n\nBut that electorate looks nothing like the one that went to the polls in 2012, when only about a third of voters were whites without college degrees and Democrats enjoyed a clear edge. So if you adjust CNN's results for a population that looks more like 2012, Clinton takes the lead by four points. Such a result would still reflect a marked decline in voter trust for Clinton as the drip-drip-drip of stories that highlight her lies about the email scandal continues. Though she may be dropping in the polls, the demographic advantages that the Democrats have carried into the fall among female, minority, and young voters are still there.\n\nIf this kind of argument about sample proportions sounds familiar, it should. As I noted in June, Mitt Romney and his supporters had claimed the 2012 polls showing Barack Obama winning were wrong because the samples were too Democratic. I made the same mistake at the time, reasoning that there was no way the electorate would skew as heavily toward minorities and Democrats as it had in 2008. Romney was wrong and so was I. It turned out that, if anything, the polls had underestimated the number of Democrats who would turn out to vote.\n\nSince then, many on the right have claimed that there were millions of missing conservative white voters who stayed home in 2012 rather than cast an unenthusiastic ballot for a moderate like Romney. There isn't much evidence to support this theory, but in order to imagine a Trump victory you'd need a 2016 turnout model composed of more whites (and with those whites being skewed toward those without a college degree) than the one that re-elected Obama in 2012.\n\nSuch a scenario is not impossible. Like most voters this year, Democrats are unenthusiastic about their choices. Clinton hasn't the appeal among minorities that the first African-American president did. If Trump wins white voters by a greater percentage than Romney did and if minority turnout doesn't increase or actually goes down, then the billionaire can win.\n\nThis would be historic, but it is also unlikely. It is hard to imagine why the fastest growing demographic sectors (particularly Hispanics) would not continue to increase their share of the vote, especially since animosity for Trump seems to be a stand-in for enthusiasm for Obama as an incentive for minorities to turn out. And since Trump is losing among college-educated whites -- a group Romney won by double digits -- the prospect of the GOP getting a higher share of the white vote requires the miraculous appearance of those missing millions of white working-class voters who have never voted and who may not actually exist.\n\nBoth sides dismiss unfavorable polls and laud those who tell them what they want to hear. But unless Trump's presence on the ballot can transform the electorate into something that doesn't seem to exist, his supporters' optimism is unfounded.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nA month ago, Donald Trump openly declared that he believed the election would be rigged against him. But now Trump and his followers aren't the only ones worrying about the integrity of the election. The Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee raises serious questions about just how far Moscow would go to help Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton because of Trump's open advocacy of appeasement of the Vladimir Putin regime. Add to that other legitimate concerns that have been discussed in the media about the security of electronic voting and reporting systems and you've got the makings of a terrible controversy if, as today's national polls indicate, the presidential election turns out to be close.\n\nTrump's talk of a rigged election fit in neatly with his dark vision of America as a corrupt nation in decline. For those who truly believe the country is on the verge of collapse, it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to think the system's malignant puppeteers will stop at nothing to prevent the Trump revolution. For months, Trump's alt-right cheering section at Breitbart and elsewhere on the Internet have been stoking his followers' fears that their hero would be cheated of the presidency. That's why some tortured souls imagine President Obama will either suspend elections or somehow thwart the will of \"we the people\" this fall.\n\nThat's crazy stuff, but given the fact that American popular culture has been endlessly feeding audiences such paranoid scenarios in films and TV shows since the 1960s, why should we be surprised if some people -- on both the left and the right -- are ready to buy into the notion that life will somehow imitate art in 2016?\n\nBut while, as our Max Boot correctly stated yesterday, the Obama administration must send a strong message to Russia to make them understand we won't tolerate any interference, we must at the same time recognize that there's nothing new about fears of cheating in American politics.\n\nOne of the most disingenuous arguments that Democrats have used against voter ID laws is that there is no such thing as voter fraud. In order to accept this claim, you'd have to forget much of American political history as well as everything we know about human nature. Attempts to rig elections are as old as the republic itself. Most pundits rightly disparaged Trump's comments about rigged elections. But the fact that they were uttered in Pennsylvania stems from by no means from unreasonable Republican allegations that Democrats have been using their minority voter stronghold in Philadelphia to pad their totals.\n\nBut let's also remember that the left has its own myths about cheating. Many Democrats remain convinced the 2000 election was stolen in Florida even if the evidence showed that Bush actually won the state, albeit because of a confusing ballot in one county that Republicans had no hand in creating. Liberals also made misleading claims about electronic voting machines being rigged to help Bush in 2004 and about his win in Ohio being the result of illegal manipulation.\n\nThese disputes are only remembered if the outcome of an election is close. Every time a presidential election is won by a narrow margin, claims of fraud arise. More to the point, those charges have special resonance when the two parties view each other's candidates as illegitimate. The Internet and social media have made this worse.\n\nIf worries about fraud are louder than ever this year it is because we have the two most unpopular presidential candidates in our modern history. Many Americans think Trump to be not merely wrong but unfit for the presidency. As the most recent polls demonstrate, just as many feel the same way about Hillary Clinton. No matter who prevails, the winner is going to be considered illegitimate by much of the country. Republicans may have thought John Kennedy's camp stole the 1960 election and some Democrats may have thought the same thing about Bush in 2000 and 2004. But those arguments will be nothing when compared to what will greet the election of either Trump or Clinton this year if the result is close.\n\nWhether or not the Russians do their worst or any other bad actor tries to cook the results, those who care about democracy must hope for a decisive win by either side. Anything else will only feed the perfect storm of paranoia and cynicism that has migrated from the fever swamps of American politics to the mainstream in recent years.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason.

Max Boot 2016-09-07 Max Boot / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe White House is sensitive to charges that the president is conducting an \"apology tour\" of the world. And it's true that on Tuesday the president didn't actually apologize in Laos for American actions in the 1960s, but he danced right up to the line.\n\nThis is what he said:\n\nOver nine years -- from 1964 to 1973 -- the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs here in Laos -- more than we dropped on Germany and Japan combined during all of World War II. It made Laos, per person, the most heavily bombed country in history. As one Laotian said, the 'bombs fell like rain.' Villages and entire valleys were obliterated. The ancient Plain of Jars was devastated. Countless civilians were killed. And that conflict was another reminder that, whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts a terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women and children. Today, I stand with you in acknowledging the suffering and sacrifices on all sides of that conflict.\n\nHe went on to pledge to double U.S. funding, to $90 million a year, to help Laos defuse bombs dropped during the Vietnam War. The problem is a very real one, as I discovered for myself while visiting Laos's Plain of Jars a few months ago -- a tourist site but one where tourists are still warned to look out for unexploded ordnance. Everything Obama said was factual, and there is nothing wrong with his desire to aid Laos -- the U.S. needs as many friends on China's borders as it can find. But his rhetoric was nevertheless one-sided and disappointing.\n\nWhat was lacking, above all, was any context. Someone who listened to Obama's speech and knew nothing of Laos's history would have been left mystified about why the U.S. dropped bombs \"like rain\" on that country. Did Americans harbor irrational fear and prejudice of Laotians? Were the Johnson and Nixon administrations motivated by racial prejudice? Perhaps they were simply staffed by psychopaths and war criminals who enjoyed annihilating small countries?\n\nHardly.\n\nWhat Obama did not mention was that in 1959, preparatory to its invasion of South Vietnam, North Vietnam invaded Laos in order to establish a major segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail bringing weapons, supplies, and manpower from North to South. North Vietnam also sponsored and supported with its own troops a Communist insurgency, the Pathet Lao, to overthrow the Royal Government of Laos. The U.S. responded to this Communist aggression -- conducted in violation of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962 -- by providing covert and overt aid to the government of Laos and to Hmong militias who were fighting the Communists. Unlike in South Vietnam, the U.S. did not send combat troops to Laos; instead it relied on the CIA and the Special Forces to fight a \"secret war\" utilizing Laotians who were determined to resist Communist domination. The most capable American-supported leader was Vang Pao, a Hmong tribesman who was a general in the Lao army. Eventually he led as many as 40,000 guerrillas fighting the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese Army.\n\nThe U.S. bombing of Laos was conducted in support of Vang Pao and other anti-Communist fighters and as part of a general effort to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- the logistics line that enabled aggression against a sovereign state allied with the United States. Those interested in learning more should read my colleague Joshua Kurlantzick's excellent forthcoming book A Great Place to Have a War: America in Laos and the Birth of a Military CIA (out in January from Simon & Schuster).\n\nIt is certainly possible to question the utility and even the morality of U.S. bombing in Laos -- but it is highly misleading for any analyst, much less the president of the United States, to criticize the U.S. in a vacuum without noting the actions of the North Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao who killed countless numbers of Laotian civilians, violated Laotian sovereignty, and ultimately overthrew the internationally recognized government of Laos in order to impose a Communist dictatorship. That dictatorship continues to rule to this day, by the way. It has made some economic reforms primarily to encourage tourism, but it remains a dictatorship that is rated \"not free\" by Freedom House.\n\nTo his credit, Obama did speak out about human rights during his trip although in a particularly mealy-mouthed way. He never directly criticized Laos's human-rights record, which is poor. He never highlighted the plight of dissidents or called for democracy. Instead he spoke in oblique terms about the importance of human rights while making clear that they are not very crucial in the U.S.-Laos relationship: \"As we do around the world, the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of what we consider universal human rights, including the rights of the people of Laos to express yourselves freely and decide your own future. Yet even as our governments deal candidly with our differences, I believe, as we have shown from Cuba to Burma to Vietnam, the best way to deliver progress for all of our peoples is by closer cooperation between our countries. And that's why, today, the United States and Laos have agreed to a new comprehensive partnership to guide and deepen our relationship for years to come.\" In other words, while saying he would speak out on behalf of human rights, Obama did not really do that.\n\nI get what Obama is up to here. He thinks the U.S. can exercise more influence today by acknowledging past \"misconduct\" without directly criticizing the behavior of countries it deals with. The problem is that, in practice, this amounts to kow-towing to dictators from Cuba to Iran and buying into their fiction that the U.S. is guilty of conduct just as bad, if not worse, than what they have done. That simply isn't true, and by shading the truth the president is failing to speak on behalf of the principles upon which the United States was founded-and which have long been our most powerful tool and selling point in international affairs. He is also inadvertently buttressing the dictatorships he is dealing with; now they can turn to their people and say in essence, \"Our problems are America's fault-the president of the United States even said so.\" What we have seen during the two terms of the Obama presidency is that by failing to speak out more robustly on behalf of freedom, the president is not winning any friends; he is simply convincing the world's dictators that he is a patsy who can be pushed around with impunity.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nDonald Trump is many things but subtle isn't one of them. While campaigning in Ohio yesterday, he said that Iran \"is going to destroy Israel unless I get elected.\" But if he wins, \"then Israel will be just fine.\" That's a pretty simple formulation and it's one that some friends of the Jewish state are buying. Are they right?\n\nThe basic premise of this apocalyptic argument is that the nuclear deal the Obama administration struck with Iran poses an existential threat to the state of Israel. Trump is right about that. The deal makes an Iranian bomb possible in the long term while also enriching the regime and strengthening its ability to support terror and harass Israel via its Hezbollah auxiliaries and Hamas allies.\n\nThe question is, what can Trump do about it? Or at least what would he do that Hillary Clinton won't?\n\nThe first advantage Trump has is that he enters the Iran debate with clean hands, having never supported President Obama's goal of rapprochement with Tehran. The same cannot be said of Clinton. No, the deal didn't happen on Clinton's watch and it might not have come to pass had she not been replaced by John Kerry at the State Department since he ardent supporter of Obama's approach on Iran. But she still supported the negotiations and the dismal final result.\n\nClinton says she will zealously enforce the terms of the deal and has made noises -- while keeping as little daylight between herself and President Obama as possible for the purposes of the campaign -- about getting tougher on Iranian behavior in the region.\n\nIn contrast to most of the other Republican presidential candidates, Trump never said he would tear up the deal. He has merely held it up as a terrible negotiation in which the U.S. gave up its goals and got little in return. The assumption is that somehow he will attempt to renegotiate or re-impose sanctions to get better terms. But since America's European allies will never go along with such a scenario, short of war, that isn't going to happen. So other than a more robust rhetorical approach to Iran, it's not clear what functional difference there will be between his Iran policy and that of Clinton.\n\nBut for all of his justified criticism of the nuclear deal, the rest of Trump's foreign and Middle East policy hints at a less contentious approach to Iran.\n\nAs Trump said in his security-policy speech delivered today in Philadelphia, he will \"work with any country\" provided they are willing to cooperate in the struggle against ISIS. While specifically eschewing regime change in any country in the region, he said \"new friendships and partnerships\" would be pursued in \"this mission.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means that Trump is interested in cooperating with Russia and, since he wants the U.S. to shoulder as little responsibility for Middle East security as possible, he seems just as willing as Obama to allow Vladimir Putin a free hand in Syria and other trouble spots. And because Russia is in business with Iran in their joint effort to preserve the Assad regime in Syria a Trump administration would appear to be pursuing the same strategic goals as Obama. Given Trump's disdain for efforts to overturn the theocratic dictatorship in Tehran and his general opposition to U.S. military interventions, friends of the Jewish state may be forgiven for dismissing all this talk about preventing Israel's destruction as mere rhetoric.\n\nPro-Israel advocates would do well to be just as skeptical of Clinton's claims as a champion of Israel. We don't know whether Trump would pursue renewed negotiations with the Palestinians or pressure Israel to help him create a peace deal. He is probably less interested, however, in a continuation of the same failed policies pursued by both the Clinton and the Obama administration. But if you're judging the two candidates on their ability to enable Israel to survive the threat from Iran, Trump's case seems less impressive in the context of his advocacy for more \"realism\" -- a word that has always been synonymous with policies that are hostile to Israeli security. Moreover, Israelis know better than to rest their safety on anything other than their own strength.\n\nPut simply, Trump's goals are mutually exclusive. The U.S. can't abandon the region while simultaneously enhancing Israel's security. And no matter how magical your negotiating skills might be, you can't have better relations with Russia and work with Iran against ISIS while also pursuing a tougher policy against the latter's nuclear program.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 2Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday's CNN/ORC poll was a thunderbolt that hit the Clinton campaign right between the eyes. Not only did the survey have Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton for the first time in the race, it also showed her surpassing Trump's already historically high negatives. If that wasn't bad enough, 50 percent of those polled expressed confidence in the GOP candidate's trustworthiness and honesty while only 35 percent would say the same for Clinton. If, as I noted, these results are repeated in other polls, it will be seen as a turning point in the race. But figuring out whether this is a harbinger of a reversal or a mere statistical outlier depends on your ideas about who will be voting in November.\n\nAs Chuck Todd pointed out on MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily yesterday, CNN's poll should be viewed with skepticism because of the sample on which it is based. The population polled by CNN had four percentage points more voters that identified as Republicans than Democrats. More than half of them were whites without a college degree. If that is what the electorate looks like in November then Trump will be poised to win or at least come close.\n\nBut that electorate looks nothing like the one that went to the polls in 2012, when only about a third of voters were whites without college degrees and Democrats enjoyed a clear edge. So if you adjust CNN's results for a population that looks more like 2012, Clinton takes the lead by four points. Such a result would still reflect a marked decline in voter trust for Clinton as the drip-drip-drip of stories that highlight her lies about the email scandal continues. Though she may be dropping in the polls, the demographic advantages that the Democrats have carried into the fall among female, minority, and young voters are still there.\n\nIf this kind of argument about sample proportions sounds familiar, it should. As I noted in June, Mitt Romney and his supporters had claimed the 2012 polls showing Barack Obama winning were wrong because the samples were too Democratic. I made the same mistake at the time, reasoning that there was no way the electorate would skew as heavily toward minorities and Democrats as it had in 2008. Romney was wrong and so was I. It turned out that, if anything, the polls had underestimated the number of Democrats who would turn out to vote.\n\nSince then, many on the right have claimed that there were millions of missing conservative white voters who stayed home in 2012 rather than cast an unenthusiastic ballot for a moderate like Romney. There isn't much evidence to support this theory, but in order to imagine a Trump victory you'd need a 2016 turnout model composed of more whites (and with those whites being skewed toward those without a college degree) than the one that re-elected Obama in 2012.\n\nSuch a scenario is not impossible. Like most voters this year, Democrats are unenthusiastic about their choices. Clinton hasn't the appeal among minorities that the first African-American president did. If Trump wins white voters by a greater percentage than Romney did and if minority turnout doesn't increase or actually goes down, then the billionaire can win.\n\nThis would be historic, but it is also unlikely. It is hard to imagine why the fastest growing demographic sectors (particularly Hispanics) would not continue to increase their share of the vote, especially since animosity for Trump seems to be a stand-in for enthusiasm for Obama as an incentive for minorities to turn out. And since Trump is losing among college-educated whites -- a group Romney won by double digits -- the prospect of the GOP getting a higher share of the white vote requires the miraculous appearance of those missing millions of white working-class voters who have never voted and who may not actually exist.\n\nBoth sides dismiss unfavorable polls and laud those who tell them what they want to hear. But unless Trump's presence on the ballot can transform the electorate into something that doesn't seem to exist, his supporters' optimism is unfounded.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nA month ago, Donald Trump openly declared that he believed the election would be rigged against him. But now Trump and his followers aren't the only ones worrying about the integrity of the election. The Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee raises serious questions about just how far Moscow would go to help Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton because of Trump's open advocacy of appeasement of the Vladimir Putin regime. Add to that other legitimate concerns that have been discussed in the media about the security of electronic voting and reporting systems and you've got the makings of a terrible controversy if, as today's national polls indicate, the presidential election turns out to be close.\n\nTrump's talk of a rigged election fit in neatly with his dark vision of America as a corrupt nation in decline. For those who truly believe the country is on the verge of collapse, it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to think the system's malignant puppeteers will stop at nothing to prevent the Trump revolution. For months, Trump's alt-right cheering section at Breitbart and elsewhere on the Internet have been stoking his followers' fears that their hero would be cheated of the presidency. That's why some tortured souls imagine President Obama will either suspend elections or somehow thwart the will of \"we the people\" this fall.\n\nThat's crazy stuff, but given the fact that American popular culture has been endlessly feeding audiences such paranoid scenarios in films and TV shows since the 1960s, why should we be surprised if some people -- on both the left and the right -- are ready to buy into the notion that life will somehow imitate art in 2016?\n\nBut while, as our Max Boot correctly stated yesterday, the Obama administration must send a strong message to Russia to make them understand we won't tolerate any interference, we must at the same time recognize that there's nothing new about fears of cheating in American politics.\n\nOne of the most disingenuous arguments that Democrats have used against voter ID laws is that there is no such thing as voter fraud. In order to accept this claim, you'd have to forget much of American political history as well as everything we know about human nature. Attempts to rig elections are as old as the republic itself. Most pundits rightly disparaged Trump's comments about rigged elections. But the fact that they were uttered in Pennsylvania stems from by no means from unreasonable Republican allegations that Democrats have been using their minority voter stronghold in Philadelphia to pad their totals.\n\nBut let's also remember that the left has its own myths about cheating. Many Democrats remain convinced the 2000 election was stolen in Florida even if the evidence showed that Bush actually won the state, albeit because of a confusing ballot in one county that Republicans had no hand in creating. Liberals also made misleading claims about electronic voting machines being rigged to help Bush in 2004 and about his win in Ohio being the result of illegal manipulation.\n\nThese disputes are only remembered if the outcome of an election is close. Every time a presidential election is won by a narrow margin, claims of fraud arise. More to the point, those charges have special resonance when the two parties view each other's candidates as illegitimate. The Internet and social media have made this worse.\n\nIf worries about fraud are louder than ever this year it is because we have the two most unpopular presidential candidates in our modern history. Many Americans think Trump to be not merely wrong but unfit for the presidency. As the most recent polls demonstrate, just as many feel the same way about Hillary Clinton. No matter who prevails, the winner is going to be considered illegitimate by much of the country. Republicans may have thought John Kennedy's camp stole the 1960 election and some Democrats may have thought the same thing about Bush in 2000 and 2004. But those arguments will be nothing when compared to what will greet the election of either Trump or Clinton this year if the result is close.\n\nWhether or not the Russians do their worst or any other bad actor tries to cook the results, those who care about democracy must hope for a decisive win by either side. Anything else will only feed the perfect storm of paranoia and cynicism that has migrated from the fever swamps of American politics to the mainstream in recent years.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 28Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe Washington Post revealed on Sunday that \"U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are investigating what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in U.S. political institutions.\"\n\nIf there is such an effort under way, it would hardly be surprising. Russia has become a master of \"active measures\" in Europe, designed to spread dissension among the Western Alliance and to make the states of Eastern Europe easier picking for Russian domination. This type of information warfare has even become known as the Gerasimov Doctrine after Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces. Russia has long been suspected of backing extreme parties of both the left and the right that oppose NATO and the European Union. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, has admitted that her party has received millions of dollars in loans from a Moscow-linked bank.\n\nEvidence that Russia's intelligence services are playing a similar game in the U.S. became evident when Russian hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee computers and released 20,000 stolen emails via Wikileaks. The resulting embarrassment forced Debbie Wasserman Schultz to step down as head of the DNC on the eve of the Democratic convention.\n\nThe question is whether further Russian intrusions are coming and what form they will take. There is speculation that Russian hackers could interfere with electronic voting machines and/or release further emails stolen from the Clinton campaign or foundation. Given the pro-Russia stance of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin certainly has every incentive to help him get elected-or, failing that, to at least spread doubt about the legitimacy of the U.S. electoral process, thus further undermining American standing in the world.\n\nThe Post notes: \"Last month, the FBI issued an unprecedented warning to state election officials urging them to be on the lookout for intrusions into their election systems and to take steps to upgrade security measures across the voting process, including voter registration, voter rolls, and election-related websites. The confidential 'flash' alert said investigators had detected attempts to penetrate election systems in several states.\"\n\nAs Republican Sen. Daniel Coats of Indiana, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Post, if Moscow is trying to influence the U.S. election, \"such actions would be an outrageous violation of international rules of behavior and cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nProving that Russia is responsible may not be possible, at least not to a legal standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" because the Russian intelligence services takes care to cover their tracks. Even when hacks can be traced to Russia, it's very difficult to prove that the Kremlin was responsible. But the U.S. government doesn't need to wait for definitive proof to act, assuming, as appears likely, the evidence is already overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet no action has been forthcoming so far. The Post article notes: \"Administration officials said they are still weighing their response.\" As a friend noted in calling my attention to this line, this is \"true for almost any foreign policy challenge facing the Obama administration.\" Reflecting the professorial style of the president, this is an administration that has a tendency to talk problems to death even as they grow worse.\n\nThis Slate article provides a good rundown of possible American responses, including: public denouncement, sanctions, indictment, \"in-domain\" retaliation, harassment or \"heckling\" of Russian officials, and \"take it on the chin.\" So far the Obama administration, in this area as in so many others, is choosing the take-it-on-the-chin option. In fact one suspects that that the information-gathering now being conducted by the intelligence community can provide a convenient cover for administration inaction-how can the president possibly do anything before all the facts are in?\n\nIn reality the president normally has to act without having 100 percent knowledge. In this case it is imperative that the U.S. do something -- anything -- in response to the Russian provocations. As cyberwarfare expert Thomas Rid has noted, \"American inaction now risks establishing a de facto norm that all election campaigns in the future, everywhere, are fair game for sabotage -- sabotage that could potentially affect the outcome and tarnish the winner's legitimacy.\"\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous.

Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 6Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday, in an exchange with reporters aboard his plane, Donald Trump offered up the latest in a series of baffling flip-flops on illegal immigration. When asked by a reporter whether he was ruling out a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants, Trump replied, \"I'm not ruling out anything.\" That was a reversal of the hard-line stand he took in his big immigration speech last week in Arizona, which was itself a reversal of statements made by the candidate and his campaign staff about \"softening\" the harsh positions he's been spouting since he began running for president.\n\nIf you find that confusing, you're not alone. Trump's surrogates are hard-pressed to keep pace with their man's statements and are reduced to disingenuously insisting that he's been consistent. But even amid the dishonest spin, one of them, Katrina Pierson, may have blurted out the truth this morning. She said on CNN that Trump's position wasn't a big deal because \"immigration is not showing to be a top priority for Americans in this election cycle.\" She's right about that, even if it contradicts everything Trump has said. And it's the only possible conclusion to draw from the results of the latest national poll that shows Trump gaining ground on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new CNN/ORC poll shows Trump edging ahead of Clinton by two points among likely voters. Coming from a poll that has consistently shown Clinton leading by significant margins, it should be taken seriously. Even more important are two other numbers that came out of the survey. For the first time, Clinton's unfavorable ratings exceeded those of Trump. The former secretary of state is disliked by 57 percent of Americans polled while Trump comes in at 56 percent. Both are historically high figures, but if you throw in the fact that CNN/ORC also finds that Trump is viewed as honest and trustworthy by 50 percent of Americans while only 35 percent would say the same about Clinton, then an election that seemed to be in the Democrats' pocket a few weeks ago might actually be up for grabs.\n\nThat a man who won't release his tax returns, has no principled beliefs, and has never had a position that couldn't be reversed can be viewed as honest and trustworthy boggles the mind. But in politics, as in much of life, such judgments rest primarily on the comparison with the alternative. Which is to say that after a year and a half of Democrats telling us that no one but the vast right-wing conspiracy cares about Clinton's scandals and the lies about them, their understanding of the voters' interests may be mistaken. Voters may not like Trump, nor can they count on him to do as he says. But they also care about the stench of corruption that emanates from the Clinton machine and all it touches.\n\nThe shift in polling doesn't necessarily doom Clinton. She is still leading in virtually every swing state and that edge is dragging down embattled Republican Congressional candidates to the point where the Democrats are now favored to take back control of the Senate. Her demographic edges among women, minorities, and young voters are still impressive. But it's also true that if enough Americans view her record with even more disgust than that of Trump, the turnout models that seemed to guarantee her victory in November may be flawed.\n\nClinton's decision to actually take questions from the reporters covering her campaign for the first time in several months may reflect a realization that her attempt to stonewall the press is counterproductive. This election is as much a referendum about her problems as it is about Trump's well-known flaws. Given Trump's lack of discipline, the focus may soon return to him and rescue the floundering Democrat. But in an election where both major candidates are disliked, nothing can be taken for granted.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:2016 presidential electionDonald TrumpHillary Clinton6Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",

We wonder at Donald Trump's insistence on enlarging a military he does not wish to use, and wonder how he can reconcile all that with his promise to destroy ISIS. And we do not forget how the president was dissed in Asia.

Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape.

Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nDonald Trump is many things but subtle isn't one of them. While campaigning in Ohio yesterday, he said that Iran \"is going to destroy Israel unless I get elected.\" But if he wins, \"then Israel will be just fine.\" That's a pretty simple formulation and it's one that some friends of the Jewish state are buying. Are they right?\n\nThe basic premise of this apocalyptic argument is that the nuclear deal the Obama administration struck with Iran poses an existential threat to the state of Israel. Trump is right about that. The deal makes an Iranian bomb possible in the long term while also enriching the regime and strengthening its ability to support terror and harass Israel via its Hezbollah auxiliaries and Hamas allies.\n\nThe question is, what can Trump do about it? Or at least what would he do that Hillary Clinton won't?\n\nThe first advantage Trump has is that he enters the Iran debate with clean hands, having never supported President Obama's goal of rapprochement with Tehran. The same cannot be said of Clinton. No, the deal didn't happen on Clinton's watch and it might not have come to pass had she not been replaced by John Kerry at the State Department since he ardent supporter of Obama's approach on Iran. But she still supported the negotiations and the dismal final result.\n\nClinton says she will zealously enforce the terms of the deal and has made noises -- while keeping as little daylight between herself and President Obama as possible for the purposes of the campaign -- about getting tougher on Iranian behavior in the region.\n\nIn contrast to most of the other Republican presidential candidates, Trump never said he would tear up the deal. He has merely held it up as a terrible negotiation in which the U.S. gave up its goals and got little in return. The assumption is that somehow he will attempt to renegotiate or re-impose sanctions to get better terms. But since America's European allies will never go along with such a scenario, short of war, that isn't going to happen. So other than a more robust rhetorical approach to Iran, it's not clear what functional difference there will be between his Iran policy and that of Clinton.\n\nBut for all of his justified criticism of the nuclear deal, the rest of Trump's foreign and Middle East policy hints at a less contentious approach to Iran.\n\nAs Trump said in his security-policy speech delivered today in Philadelphia, he will \"work with any country\" provided they are willing to cooperate in the struggle against ISIS. While specifically eschewing regime change in any country in the region, he said \"new friendships and partnerships\" would be pursued in \"this mission.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means that Trump is interested in cooperating with Russia and, since he wants the U.S. to shoulder as little responsibility for Middle East security as possible, he seems just as willing as Obama to allow Vladimir Putin a free hand in Syria and other trouble spots. And because Russia is in business with Iran in their joint effort to preserve the Assad regime in Syria a Trump administration would appear to be pursuing the same strategic goals as Obama. Given Trump's disdain for efforts to overturn the theocratic dictatorship in Tehran and his general opposition to U.S. military interventions, friends of the Jewish state may be forgiven for dismissing all this talk about preventing Israel's destruction as mere rhetoric.\n\nPro-Israel advocates would do well to be just as skeptical of Clinton's claims as a champion of Israel. We don't know whether Trump would pursue renewed negotiations with the Palestinians or pressure Israel to help him create a peace deal. He is probably less interested, however, in a continuation of the same failed policies pursued by both the Clinton and the Obama administration. But if you're judging the two candidates on their ability to enable Israel to survive the threat from Iran, Trump's case seems less impressive in the context of his advocacy for more \"realism\" -- a word that has always been synonymous with policies that are hostile to Israeli security. Moreover, Israelis know better than to rest their safety on anything other than their own strength.\n\nPut simply, Trump's goals are mutually exclusive. The U.S. can't abandon the region while simultaneously enhancing Israel's security. And no matter how magical your negotiating skills might be, you can't have better relations with Russia and work with Iran against ISIS while also pursuing a tougher policy against the latter's nuclear program.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 2Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday's CNN/ORC poll was a thunderbolt that hit the Clinton campaign right between the eyes. Not only did the survey have Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton for the first time in the race, it also showed her surpassing Trump's already historically high negatives. If that wasn't bad enough, 50 percent of those polled expressed confidence in the GOP candidate's trustworthiness and honesty while only 35 percent would say the same for Clinton. If, as I noted, these results are repeated in other polls, it will be seen as a turning point in the race. But figuring out whether this is a harbinger of a reversal or a mere statistical outlier depends on your ideas about who will be voting in November.\n\nAs Chuck Todd pointed out on MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily yesterday, CNN's poll should be viewed with skepticism because of the sample on which it is based. The population polled by CNN had four percentage points more voters that identified as Republicans than Democrats. More than half of them were whites without a college degree. If that is what the electorate looks like in November then Trump will be poised to win or at least come close.\n\nBut that electorate looks nothing like the one that went to the polls in 2012, when only about a third of voters were whites without college degrees and Democrats enjoyed a clear edge. So if you adjust CNN's results for a population that looks more like 2012, Clinton takes the lead by four points. Such a result would still reflect a marked decline in voter trust for Clinton as the drip-drip-drip of stories that highlight her lies about the email scandal continues. Though she may be dropping in the polls, the demographic advantages that the Democrats have carried into the fall among female, minority, and young voters are still there.\n\nIf this kind of argument about sample proportions sounds familiar, it should. As I noted in June, Mitt Romney and his supporters had claimed the 2012 polls showing Barack Obama winning were wrong because the samples were too Democratic. I made the same mistake at the time, reasoning that there was no way the electorate would skew as heavily toward minorities and Democrats as it had in 2008. Romney was wrong and so was I. It turned out that, if anything, the polls had underestimated the number of Democrats who would turn out to vote.\n\nSince then, many on the right have claimed that there were millions of missing conservative white voters who stayed home in 2012 rather than cast an unenthusiastic ballot for a moderate like Romney. There isn't much evidence to support this theory, but in order to imagine a Trump victory you'd need a 2016 turnout model composed of more whites (and with those whites being skewed toward those without a college degree) than the one that re-elected Obama in 2012.\n\nSuch a scenario is not impossible. Like most voters this year, Democrats are unenthusiastic about their choices. Clinton hasn't the appeal among minorities that the first African-American president did. If Trump wins white voters by a greater percentage than Romney did and if minority turnout doesn't increase or actually goes down, then the billionaire can win.\n\nThis would be historic, but it is also unlikely. It is hard to imagine why the fastest growing demographic sectors (particularly Hispanics) would not continue to increase their share of the vote, especially since animosity for Trump seems to be a stand-in for enthusiasm for Obama as an incentive for minorities to turn out. And since Trump is losing among college-educated whites -- a group Romney won by double digits -- the prospect of the GOP getting a higher share of the white vote requires the miraculous appearance of those missing millions of white working-class voters who have never voted and who may not actually exist.\n\nBoth sides dismiss unfavorable polls and laud those who tell them what they want to hear. But unless Trump's presence on the ballot can transform the electorate into something that doesn't seem to exist, his supporters' optimism is unfounded.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth.

When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nA month ago, Donald Trump openly declared that he believed the election would be rigged against him. But now Trump and his followers aren't the only ones worrying about the integrity of the election. The Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee raises serious questions about just how far Moscow would go to help Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton because of Trump's open advocacy of appeasement of the Vladimir Putin regime. Add to that other legitimate concerns that have been discussed in the media about the security of electronic voting and reporting systems and you've got the makings of a terrible controversy if, as today's national polls indicate, the presidential election turns out to be close.\n\nTrump's talk of a rigged election fit in neatly with his dark vision of America as a corrupt nation in decline. For those who truly believe the country is on the verge of collapse, it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to think the system's malignant puppeteers will stop at nothing to prevent the Trump revolution. For months, Trump's alt-right cheering section at Breitbart and elsewhere on the Internet have been stoking his followers' fears that their hero would be cheated of the presidency. That's why some tortured souls imagine President Obama will either suspend elections or somehow thwart the will of \"we the people\" this fall.\n\nThat's crazy stuff, but given the fact that American popular culture has been endlessly feeding audiences such paranoid scenarios in films and TV shows since the 1960s, why should we be surprised if some people -- on both the left and the right -- are ready to buy into the notion that life will somehow imitate art in 2016?\n\nBut while, as our Max Boot correctly stated yesterday, the Obama administration must send a strong message to Russia to make them understand we won't tolerate any interference, we must at the same time recognize that there's nothing new about fears of cheating in American politics.\n\nOne of the most disingenuous arguments that Democrats have used against voter ID laws is that there is no such thing as voter fraud. In order to accept this claim, you'd have to forget much of American political history as well as everything we know about human nature. Attempts to rig elections are as old as the republic itself. Most pundits rightly disparaged Trump's comments about rigged elections. But the fact that they were uttered in Pennsylvania stems from by no means from unreasonable Republican allegations that Democrats have been using their minority voter stronghold in Philadelphia to pad their totals.\n\nBut let's also remember that the left has its own myths about cheating. Many Democrats remain convinced the 2000 election was stolen in Florida even if the evidence showed that Bush actually won the state, albeit because of a confusing ballot in one county that Republicans had no hand in creating. Liberals also made misleading claims about electronic voting machines being rigged to help Bush in 2004 and about his win in Ohio being the result of illegal manipulation.\n\nThese disputes are only remembered if the outcome of an election is close. Every time a presidential election is won by a narrow margin, claims of fraud arise. More to the point, those charges have special resonance when the two parties view each other's candidates as illegitimate. The Internet and social media have made this worse.\n\nIf worries about fraud are louder than ever this year it is because we have the two most unpopular presidential candidates in our modern history. Many Americans think Trump to be not merely wrong but unfit for the presidency. As the most recent polls demonstrate, just as many feel the same way about Hillary Clinton. No matter who prevails, the winner is going to be considered illegitimate by much of the country. Republicans may have thought John Kennedy's camp stole the 1960 election and some Democrats may have thought the same thing about Bush in 2000 and 2004. But those arguments will be nothing when compared to what will greet the election of either Trump or Clinton this year if the result is close.\n\nWhether or not the Russians do their worst or any other bad actor tries to cook the results, those who care about democracy must hope for a decisive win by either side. Anything else will only feed the perfect storm of paranoia and cynicism that has migrated from the fever swamps of American politics to the mainstream in recent years.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol.

This type of information warfare has even become known as the Gerasimov Doctrine after Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces. Russia has long been suspected of backing extreme parties of both the left and the right that oppose NATO and the European Union. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, has admitted that her party has received millions of dollars in loans from a Moscow-linked bank.\n\nEvidence that Russia's intelligence services are playing a similar game in the U.S. became evident when Russian hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee computers and released 20,000 stolen emails via Wikileaks. The resulting embarrassment forced Debbie Wasserman Schultz to step down as head of the DNC on the eve of the Democratic convention.\n\nThe question is whether further Russian intrusions are coming and what form they will take. There is speculation that Russian hackers could interfere with electronic voting machines and/or release further emails stolen from the Clinton campaign or foundation. Given the pro-Russia stance of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin certainly has every incentive to help him get elected-or, failing that, to at least spread doubt about the legitimacy of the U.S. electoral process, thus further undermining American standing in the world.\n\nThe Post notes: \"Last month, the FBI issued an unprecedented warning to state election officials urging them to be on the lookout for intrusions into their election systems and to take steps to upgrade security measures across the voting process, including voter registration, voter rolls, and election-related websites. The confidential 'flash' alert said investigators had detected attempts to penetrate election systems in several states.\"\n\nAs Republican Sen. Daniel Coats of Indiana, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Post, if Moscow is trying to influence the U.S. election, \"such actions would be an outrageous violation of international rules of behavior and cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nProving that Russia is responsible may not be possible, at least not to a legal standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" because the Russian intelligence services takes care to cover their tracks. Even when hacks can be traced to Russia, it's very difficult to prove that the Kremlin was responsible. But the U.S. government doesn't need to wait for definitive proof to act, assuming, as appears likely, the evidence is already overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet no action has been forthcoming so far. The Post article notes: \"Administration officials said they are still weighing their response.\" As a friend noted in calling my attention to this line, this is \"true for almost any foreign policy challenge facing the Obama administration.\" Reflecting the professorial style of the president, this is an administration that has a tendency to talk problems to death even as they grow worse.\n\nThis Slate article provides a good rundown of possible American responses, including: public denouncement, sanctions, indictment, \"in-domain\" retaliation, harassment or \"heckling\" of Russian officials, and \"take it on the chin.\" So far the Obama administration, in this area as in so many others, is choosing the take-it-on-the-chin option. In fact one suspects that that the information-gathering now being conducted by the intelligence community can provide a convenient cover for administration inaction-how can the president possibly do anything before all the facts are in?\n\nIn reality the president normally has to act without having 100 percent knowledge. In this case it is imperative that the U.S. do something -- anything -- in response to the Russian provocations. As cyberwarfare expert Thomas Rid has noted, \"American inaction now risks establishing a de facto norm that all election campaigns in the future, everywhere, are fair game for sabotage -- sabotage that could potentially affect the outcome and tarnish the winner's legitimacy.\"\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:cyberwarfareRussian hackingU.S.-Russia relations28Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles: Campaigns & Elections What Voters Care About Jonathan S.

Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 6Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday, in an exchange with reporters aboard his plane, Donald Trump offered up the latest in a series of baffling flip-flops on illegal immigration. When asked by a reporter whether he was ruling out a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants, Trump replied, \"I'm not ruling out anything.\" That was a reversal of the hard-line stand he took in his big immigration speech last week in Arizona, which was itself a reversal of statements made by the candidate and his campaign staff about \"softening\" the harsh positions he's been spouting since he began running for president.\n\nIf you find that confusing, you're not alone. Trump's surrogates are hard-pressed to keep pace with their man's statements and are reduced to disingenuously insisting that he's been consistent. But even amid the dishonest spin, one of them, Katrina Pierson, may have blurted out the truth this morning. She said on CNN that Trump's position wasn't a big deal because \"immigration is not showing to be a top priority for Americans in this election cycle.\" She's right about that, even if it contradicts everything Trump has said. And it's the only possible conclusion to draw from the results of the latest national poll that shows Trump gaining ground on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new CNN/ORC poll shows Trump edging ahead of Clinton by two points among likely voters. Coming from a poll that has consistently shown Clinton leading by significant margins, it should be taken seriously. Even more important are two other numbers that came out of the survey. For the first time, Clinton's unfavorable ratings exceeded those of Trump. The former secretary of state is disliked by 57 percent of Americans polled while Trump comes in at 56 percent. Both are historically high figures, but if you throw in the fact that CNN/ORC also finds that Trump is viewed as honest and trustworthy by 50 percent of Americans while only 35 percent would say the same about Clinton, then an election that seemed to be in the Democrats' pocket a few weeks ago might actually be up for grabs.\n\nThat a man who won't release his tax returns, has no principled beliefs, and has never had a position that couldn't be reversed can be viewed as honest and trustworthy boggles the mind. But in politics, as in much of life, such judgments rest primarily on the comparison with the alternative. Which is to say that after a year and a half of Democrats telling us that no one but the vast right-wing conspiracy cares about Clinton's scandals and the lies about them, their understanding of the voters' interests may be mistaken. Voters may not like Trump, nor can they count on him to do as he says. But they also care about the stench of corruption that emanates from the Clinton machine and all it touches.\n\nThe shift in polling doesn't necessarily doom Clinton. She is still leading in virtually every swing state and that edge is dragging down embattled Republican Congressional candidates to the point where the Democrats are now favored to take back control of the Senate. Her demographic edges among women, minorities, and young voters are still impressive. But it's also true that if enough Americans view her record with even more disgust than that of Trump, the turnout models that seemed to guarantee her victory in November may be flawed.\n\nClinton's decision to actually take questions from the reporters covering her campaign for the first time in several months may reflect a realization that her attempt to stonewall the press is counterproductive. This election is as much a referendum about her problems as it is about Trump's well-known flaws. Given Trump's lack of discipline, the focus may soon return to him and rescue the floundering Democrat. But in an election where both major candidates are disliked, nothing can be taken for granted.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:2016 presidential electionDonald TrumpHillary Clinton6Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",

                    "body": "Iran Can Only Trump Save Israel? Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nDonald Trump is many things but subtle isn't one of them. While campaigning in Ohio yesterday, he said that Iran \"is going to destroy Israel unless I get elected.\" But if he wins, \"then Israel will be just fine.\" That's a pretty simple formulation and it's one that some friends of the Jewish state are buying. Are they right?\n\nThe basic premise of this apocalyptic argument is that the nuclear deal the Obama administration struck with Iran poses an existential threat to the state of Israel. Trump is right about that. The deal makes an Iranian bomb possible in the long term while also enriching the regime and strengthening its ability to support terror and harass Israel via its Hezbollah auxiliaries and Hamas allies.\n\nThe question is, what can Trump do about it? Or at least what would he do that Hillary Clinton won't?\n\nThe first advantage Trump has is that he enters the Iran debate with clean hands, having never supported President Obama's goal of rapprochement with Tehran. The same cannot be said of Clinton. No, the deal didn't happen on Clinton's watch and it might not have come to pass had she not been replaced by John Kerry at the State Department since he ardent supporter of Obama's approach on Iran. But she still supported the negotiations and the dismal final result.\n\nClinton says she will zealously enforce the terms of the deal and has made noises -- while keeping as little daylight between herself and President Obama as possible for the purposes of the campaign -- about getting tougher on Iranian behavior in the region.\n\nIn contrast to most of the other Republican presidential candidates, Trump never said he would tear up the deal. He has merely held it up as a terrible negotiation in which the U.S. gave up its goals and got little in return. The assumption is that somehow he will attempt to renegotiate or re-impose sanctions to get better terms. But since America's European allies will never go along with such a scenario, short of war, that isn't going to happen. So other than a more robust rhetorical approach to Iran, it's not clear what functional difference there will be between his Iran policy and that of Clinton.\n\nBut for all of his justified criticism of the nuclear deal, the rest of Trump's foreign and Middle East policy hints at a less contentious approach to Iran.\n\nAs Trump said in his security-policy speech delivered today in Philadelphia, he will \"work with any country\" provided they are willing to cooperate in the struggle against ISIS. While specifically eschewing regime change in any country in the region, he said \"new friendships and partnerships\" would be pursued in \"this mission.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means that Trump is interested in cooperating with Russia and, since he wants the U.S. to shoulder as little responsibility for Middle East security as possible, he seems just as willing as Obama to allow Vladimir Putin a free hand in Syria and other trouble spots. And because Russia is in business with Iran in their joint effort to preserve the Assad regime in Syria a Trump administration would appear to be pursuing the same strategic goals as Obama. Given Trump's disdain for efforts to overturn the theocratic dictatorship in Tehran and his general opposition to U.S. military interventions, friends of the Jewish state may be forgiven for dismissing all this talk about preventing Israel's destruction as mere rhetoric.\n\nPro-Israel advocates would do well to be just as skeptical of Clinton's claims as a champion of Israel. We don't know whether Trump would pursue renewed negotiations with the Palestinians or pressure Israel to help him create a peace deal. He is probably less interested, however, in a continuation of the same failed policies pursued by both the Clinton and the Obama administration. But if you're judging the two candidates on their ability to enable Israel to survive the threat from Iran, Trump's case seems less impressive in the context of his advocacy for more \"realism\" -- a word that has always been synonymous with policies that are hostile to Israeli security. Moreover, Israelis know better than to rest their safety on anything other than their own strength.\n\nPut simply, Trump's goals are mutually exclusive. The U.S. can't abandon the region while simultaneously enhancing Israel's security. And no matter how magical your negotiating skills might be, you can't have better relations with Russia and work with Iran against ISIS while also pursuing a tougher policy against the latter's nuclear program.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 2Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday's CNN/ORC poll was a thunderbolt that hit the Clinton campaign right between the eyes. Not only did the survey have Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton for the first time in the race, it also showed her surpassing Trump's already historically high negatives. If that wasn't bad enough, 50 percent of those polled expressed confidence in the GOP candidate's trustworthiness and honesty while only 35 percent would say the same for Clinton. If, as I noted, these results are repeated in other polls, it will be seen as a turning point in the race. But figuring out whether this is a harbinger of a reversal or a mere statistical outlier depends on your ideas about who will be voting in November.\n\nAs Chuck Todd pointed out on MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily yesterday, CNN's poll should be viewed with skepticism because of the sample on which it is based. The population polled by CNN had four percentage points more voters that identified as Republicans than Democrats. More than half of them were whites without a college degree. If that is what the electorate looks like in November then Trump will be poised to win or at least come close.\n\nBut that electorate looks nothing like the one that went to the polls in 2012, when only about a third of voters were whites without college degrees and Democrats enjoyed a clear edge. So if you adjust CNN's results for a population that looks more like 2012, Clinton takes the lead by four points. Such a result would still reflect a marked decline in voter trust for Clinton as the drip-drip-drip of stories that highlight her lies about the email scandal continues. Though she may be dropping in the polls, the demographic advantages that the Democrats have carried into the fall among female, minority, and young voters are still there.\n\nIf this kind of argument about sample proportions sounds familiar, it should. As I noted in June, Mitt Romney and his supporters had claimed the 2012 polls showing Barack Obama winning were wrong because the samples were too Democratic. I made the same mistake at the time, reasoning that there was no way the electorate would skew as heavily toward minorities and Democrats as it had in 2008. Romney was wrong and so was I. It turned out that, if anything, the polls had underestimated the number of Democrats who would turn out to vote.\n\nSince then, many on the right have claimed that there were millions of missing conservative white voters who stayed home in 2012 rather than cast an unenthusiastic ballot for a moderate like Romney. There isn't much evidence to support this theory, but in order to imagine a Trump victory you'd need a 2016 turnout model composed of more whites (and with those whites being skewed toward those without a college degree) than the one that re-elected Obama in 2012.\n\nSuch a scenario is not impossible. Like most voters this year, Democrats are unenthusiastic about their choices. Clinton hasn't the appeal among minorities that the first African-American president did. If Trump wins white voters by a greater percentage than Romney did and if minority turnout doesn't increase or actually goes down, then the billionaire can win.\n\nThis would be historic, but it is also unlikely. It is hard to imagine why the fastest growing demographic sectors (particularly Hispanics) would not continue to increase their share of the vote, especially since animosity for Trump seems to be a stand-in for enthusiasm for Obama as an incentive for minorities to turn out. And since Trump is losing among college-educated whites -- a group Romney won by double digits -- the prospect of the GOP getting a higher share of the white vote requires the miraculous appearance of those missing millions of white working-class voters who have never voted and who may not actually exist.\n\nBoth sides dismiss unfavorable polls and laud those who tell them what they want to hear. But unless Trump's presence on the ballot can transform the electorate into something that doesn't seem to exist, his supporters' optimism is unfounded.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nA month ago, Donald Trump openly declared that he believed the election would be rigged against him. But now Trump and his followers aren't the only ones worrying about the integrity of the election. The Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee raises serious questions about just how far Moscow would go to help Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton because of Trump's open advocacy of appeasement of the Vladimir Putin regime. Add to that other legitimate concerns that have been discussed in the media about the security of electronic voting and reporting systems and you've got the makings of a terrible controversy if, as today's national polls indicate, the presidential election turns out to be close.\n\nTrump's talk of a rigged election fit in neatly with his dark vision of America as a corrupt nation in decline. For those who truly believe the country is on the verge of collapse, it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to think the system's malignant puppeteers will stop at nothing to prevent the Trump revolution. For months, Trump's alt-right cheering section at Breitbart and elsewhere on the Internet have been stoking his followers' fears that their hero would be cheated of the presidency. That's why some tortured souls imagine President Obama will either suspend elections or somehow thwart the will of \"we the people\" this fall.\n\nThat's crazy stuff, but given the fact that American popular culture has been endlessly feeding audiences such paranoid scenarios in films and TV shows since the 1960s, why should we be surprised if some people -- on both the left and the right -- are ready to buy into the notion that life will somehow imitate art in 2016?\n\nBut while, as our Max Boot correctly stated yesterday, the Obama administration must send a strong message to Russia to make them understand we won't tolerate any interference, we must at the same time recognize that there's nothing new about fears of cheating in American politics.\n\nOne of the most disingenuous arguments that Democrats have used against voter ID laws is that there is no such thing as voter fraud. In order to accept this claim, you'd have to forget much of American political history as well as everything we know about human nature. Attempts to rig elections are as old as the republic itself. Most pundits rightly disparaged Trump's comments about rigged elections. But the fact that they were uttered in Pennsylvania stems from by no means from unreasonable Republican allegations that Democrats have been using their minority voter stronghold in Philadelphia to pad their totals.\n\nBut let's also remember that the left has its own myths about cheating. Many Democrats remain convinced the 2000 election was stolen in Florida even if the evidence showed that Bush actually won the state, albeit because of a confusing ballot in one county that Republicans had no hand in creating. Liberals also made misleading claims about electronic voting machines being rigged to help Bush in 2004 and about his win in Ohio being the result of illegal manipulation.\n\nThese disputes are only remembered if the outcome of an election is close. Every time a presidential election is won by a narrow margin, claims of fraud arise. More to the point, those charges have special resonance when the two parties view each other's candidates as illegitimate. The Internet and social media have made this worse.\n\nIf worries about fraud are louder than ever this year it is because we have the two most unpopular presidential candidates in our modern history. Many Americans think Trump to be not merely wrong but unfit for the presidency. As the most recent polls demonstrate, just as many feel the same way about Hillary Clinton. No matter who prevails, the winner is going to be considered illegitimate by much of the country. Republicans may have thought John Kennedy's camp stole the 1960 election and some Democrats may have thought the same thing about Bush in 2000 and 2004. But those arguments will be nothing when compared to what will greet the election of either Trump or Clinton this year if the result is close.\n\nWhether or not the Russians do their worst or any other bad actor tries to cook the results, those who care about democracy must hope for a decisive win by either side. Anything else will only feed the perfect storm of paranoia and cynicism that has migrated from the fever swamps of American politics to the mainstream in recent years.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 28Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe Washington Post revealed on Sunday that \"U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are investigating what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in U.S. political institutions.\"\n\nIf there is such an effort under way, it would hardly be surprising. Russia has become a master of \"active measures\" in Europe, designed to spread dissension among the Western Alliance and to make the states of Eastern Europe easier picking for Russian domination. This type of information warfare has even become known as the Gerasimov Doctrine after Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces. Russia has long been suspected of backing extreme parties of both the left and the right that oppose NATO and the European Union. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, has admitted that her party has received millions of dollars in loans from a Moscow-linked bank.\n\nEvidence that Russia's intelligence services are playing a similar game in the U.S. became evident when Russian hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee computers and released 20,000 stolen emails via Wikileaks. The resulting embarrassment forced Debbie Wasserman Schultz to step down as head of the DNC on the eve of the Democratic convention.\n\nThe question is whether further Russian intrusions are coming and what form they will take. There is speculation that Russian hackers could interfere with electronic voting machines and/or release further emails stolen from the Clinton campaign or foundation. Given the pro-Russia stance of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin certainly has every incentive to help him get elected-or, failing that, to at least spread doubt about the legitimacy of the U.S. electoral process, thus further undermining American standing in the world.\n\nThe Post notes: \"Last month, the FBI issued an unprecedented warning to state election officials urging them to be on the lookout for intrusions into their election systems and to take steps to upgrade security measures across the voting process, including voter registration, voter rolls, and election-related websites. The confidential 'flash' alert said investigators had detected attempts to penetrate election systems in several states.\"\n\nAs Republican Sen. Daniel Coats of Indiana, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Post, if Moscow is trying to influence the U.S. election, \"such actions would be an outrageous violation of international rules of behavior and cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nProving that Russia is responsible may not be possible, at least not to a legal standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" because the Russian intelligence services takes care to cover their tracks. Even when hacks can be traced to Russia, it's very difficult to prove that the Kremlin was responsible. But the U.S. government doesn't need to wait for definitive proof to act, assuming, as appears likely, the evidence is already overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet no action has been forthcoming so far. The Post article notes: \"Administration officials said they are still weighing their response.\" As a friend noted in calling my attention to this line, this is \"true for almost any foreign policy challenge facing the Obama administration.\" Reflecting the professorial style of the president, this is an administration that has a tendency to talk problems to death even as they grow worse.\n\nThis Slate article provides a good rundown of possible American responses, including: public denouncement, sanctions, indictment, \"in-domain\" retaliation, harassment or \"heckling\" of Russian officials, and \"take it on the chin.\" So far the Obama administration, in this area as in so many others, is choosing the take-it-on-the-chin option. In fact one suspects that that the information-gathering now being conducted by the intelligence community can provide a convenient cover for administration inaction-how can the president possibly do anything before all the facts are in?\n\nIn reality the president normally has to act without having 100 percent knowledge. In this case it is imperative that the U.S. do something -- anything -- in response to the Russian provocations. As cyberwarfare expert Thomas Rid has noted, \"American inaction now risks establishing a de facto norm that all election campaigns in the future, everywhere, are fair game for sabotage -- sabotage that could potentially affect the outcome and tarnish the winner's legitimacy.\"\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers.

Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 6Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday, in an exchange with reporters aboard his plane, Donald Trump offered up the latest in a series of baffling flip-flops on illegal immigration. When asked by a reporter whether he was ruling out a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants, Trump replied, \"I'm not ruling out anything.\" That was a reversal of the hard-line stand he took in his big immigration speech last week in Arizona, which was itself a reversal of statements made by the candidate and his campaign staff about \"softening\" the harsh positions he's been spouting since he began running for president.\n\nIf you find that confusing, you're not alone. Trump's surrogates are hard-pressed to keep pace with their man's statements and are reduced to disingenuously insisting that he's been consistent. But even amid the dishonest spin, one of them, Katrina Pierson, may have blurted out the truth this morning. She said on CNN that Trump's position wasn't a big deal because \"immigration is not showing to be a top priority for Americans in this election cycle.\" She's right about that, even if it contradicts everything Trump has said. And it's the only possible conclusion to draw from the results of the latest national poll that shows Trump gaining ground on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new CNN/ORC poll shows Trump edging ahead of Clinton by two points among likely voters. Coming from a poll that has consistently shown Clinton leading by significant margins, it should be taken seriously. Even more important are two other numbers that came out of the survey. For the first time, Clinton's unfavorable ratings exceeded those of Trump. The former secretary of state is disliked by 57 percent of Americans polled while Trump comes in at 56 percent. Both are historically high figures, but if you throw in the fact that CNN/ORC also finds that Trump is viewed as honest and trustworthy by 50 percent of Americans while only 35 percent would say the same about Clinton, then an election that seemed to be in the Democrats' pocket a few weeks ago might actually be up for grabs.\n\nThat a man who won't release his tax returns, has no principled beliefs, and has never had a position that couldn't be reversed can be viewed as honest and trustworthy boggles the mind. But in politics, as in much of life, such judgments rest primarily on the comparison with the alternative. Which is to say that after a year and a half of Democrats telling us that no one but the vast right-wing conspiracy cares about Clinton's scandals and the lies about them, their understanding of the voters' interests may be mistaken. Voters may not like Trump, nor can they count on him to do as he says. But they also care about the stench of corruption that emanates from the Clinton machine and all it touches.\n\nThe shift in polling doesn't necessarily doom Clinton. She is still leading in virtually every swing state and that edge is dragging down embattled Republican Congressional candidates to the point where the Democrats are now favored to take back control of the Senate. Her demographic edges among women, minorities, and young voters are still impressive. But it's also true that if enough Americans view her record with even more disgust than that of Trump, the turnout models that seemed to guarantee her victory in November may be flawed.\n\nClinton's decision to actually take questions from the reporters covering her campaign for the first time in several months may reflect a realization that her attempt to stonewall the press is counterproductive. This election is as much a referendum about her problems as it is about Trump's well-known flaws. Given Trump's lack of discipline, the focus may soon return to him and rescue the floundering Democrat. But in an election where both major candidates are disliked, nothing can be taken for granted.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 10Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nNew details have emerged in recent weeks about how three Americans were freed from Iranian prisons on January 17. That very day a cargo aircraft with pallets full of $400 million in cash landed in Tehran. The Obama administration denies any connection between these two events but common sense suggests that the delivery of the money -- even if it was ostensibly to pay old claims for Iranian arms sales dating back to 1979 -- was conditioned on the release of the hostages. Hence it was, in the common understanding, a ransom.\n\nBut even as those American hostages were being released, new ones were being seized. On January 15, three American contractors working for a subsidiary of General Dynamics to train Iraqi Special Forces were seized by Shiite gunmen in Baghdad and held for a month before being released. In a fascinating interview with Hannah Allam of McClatchey, the hostages for the first time tell their story, thus shedding a bit more light on what happened.\n\nThe three men were Waiel El-Maadawy, an Egyptian-American Army veteran and former Florida sheriff's deputy; his cousin and fellow Arabic speaker, Amr Mohamed; and Russell Frost, from Wichita, Kansas. The three men were seized from an interpreter's apartment -- and had to endure the indignity of having Iraqi officials claim they were actually in a bordello. Later they had to suffer a month of torture: \"The next three weeks brought round-the-clock horror: excruciating pain and utter darkness. They were kept blindfolded and shackled in stress positions, didn't get much food and learned to urinate in empty water bottles to avoid the beatings that accompanied bathroom visits, the men said. One captor patted El-Maadawy's muscular build and told him it was a shame that 'all that was about to be worm food.' \" The three men continue to struggle with the physical and psychological toll of their ordeal to this day.\n\nAnd who was responsible for inflicting this torture on them? According to McClatchey, \"The two Arabic-speaking Americans asked their captors whether they were part of the Iraqi government. They replied that the Iraqi government 'paid them to be in charge of this neighborhood,' El-Maadawy said.... 'They were supporting the Iraqi government, augmenting the Iraqi forces,' El-Maadawy said of his captors. 'In essence, we were kidnapped by the Iraqi government.' \"\n\nBut even though they were closely linked to the Iraqi government, the Sadrist gunmen also must have had close links to the Iranian government -- ties that go unmentioned in this article. The Popular Mobilization Forces, the Shiite militia group of which these kidnappers were a part, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Iranian Quds Force. It is doubtful that the kidnappers could have held three Americans for a month without at least a tacit okay from the Iranian government -- and probably would not have released them either without an okay from Tehran.\n\nBut we know nothing about why the men were held or why they were released. This story is told strictly from the hostages' point of view; they didn't know why the Shiite militiamen decided to hold them or to release them. Was a deal struck between Washington and Tehran or between Washington and Baghdad? It did not necessarily have to be a monetary deal -- there could have been a quid pro quo of some kind. We simply don't know. If Congress is going to probe the $400 million payment to Tehran, it should probe the contractors' kidnapping as well, along with the more recent seizure of further dual-national Iranians to replace the ones that have been released.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice.

Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday's CNN/ORC poll was a thunderbolt that hit the Clinton campaign right between the eyes. Not only did the survey have Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton for the first time in the race, it also showed her surpassing Trump's already historically high negatives. If that wasn't bad enough, 50 percent of those polled expressed confidence in the GOP candidate's trustworthiness and honesty while only 35 percent would say the same for Clinton. If, as I noted, these results are repeated in other polls, it will be seen as a turning point in the race. But figuring out whether this is a harbinger of a reversal or a mere statistical outlier depends on your ideas about who will be voting in November.\n\nAs Chuck Todd pointed out on MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily yesterday, CNN's poll should be viewed with skepticism because of the sample on which it is based. The population polled by CNN had four percentage points more voters that identified as Republicans than Democrats. More than half of them were whites without a college degree. If that is what the electorate looks like in November then Trump will be poised to win or at least come close.\n\nBut that electorate looks nothing like the one that went to the polls in 2012, when only about a third of voters were whites without college degrees and Democrats enjoyed a clear edge. So if you adjust CNN's results for a population that looks more like 2012, Clinton takes the lead by four points. Such a result would still reflect a marked decline in voter trust for Clinton as the drip-drip-drip of stories that highlight her lies about the email scandal continues. Though she may be dropping in the polls, the demographic advantages that the Democrats have carried into the fall among female, minority, and young voters are still there.\n\nIf this kind of argument about sample proportions sounds familiar, it should. As I noted in June, Mitt Romney and his supporters had claimed the 2012 polls showing Barack Obama winning were wrong because the samples were too Democratic. I made the same mistake at the time, reasoning that there was no way the electorate would skew as heavily toward minorities and Democrats as it had in 2008. Romney was wrong and so was I. It turned out that, if anything, the polls had underestimated the number of Democrats who would turn out to vote.\n\nSince then, many on the right have claimed that there were millions of missing conservative white voters who stayed home in 2012 rather than cast an unenthusiastic ballot for a moderate like Romney. There isn't much evidence to support this theory, but in order to imagine a Trump victory you'd need a 2016 turnout model composed of more whites (and with those whites being skewed toward those without a college degree) than the one that re-elected Obama in 2012.\n\nSuch a scenario is not impossible. Like most voters this year, Democrats are unenthusiastic about their choices. Clinton hasn't the appeal among minorities that the first African-American president did. If Trump wins white voters by a greater percentage than Romney did and if minority turnout doesn't increase or actually goes down, then the billionaire can win.\n\nThis would be historic, but it is also unlikely. It is hard to imagine why the fastest growing demographic sectors (particularly Hispanics) would not continue to increase their share of the vote, especially since animosity for Trump seems to be a stand-in for enthusiasm for Obama as an incentive for minorities to turn out. And since Trump is losing among college-educated whites -- a group Romney won by double digits -- the prospect of the GOP getting a higher share of the white vote requires the miraculous appearance of those missing millions of white working-class voters who have never voted and who may not actually exist.\n\nBoth sides dismiss unfavorable polls and laud those who tell them what they want to hear. But unless Trump's presence on the ballot can transform the electorate into something that doesn't seem to exist, his supporters' optimism is unfounded.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument.

Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nA month ago, Donald Trump openly declared that he believed the election would be rigged against him. But now Trump and his followers aren't the only ones worrying about the integrity of the election. The Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee raises serious questions about just how far Moscow would go to help Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton because of Trump's open advocacy of appeasement of the Vladimir Putin regime. Add to that other legitimate concerns that have been discussed in the media about the security of electronic voting and reporting systems and you've got the makings of a terrible controversy if, as today's national polls indicate, the presidential election turns out to be close.\n\nTrump's talk of a rigged election fit in neatly with his dark vision of America as a corrupt nation in decline. For those who truly believe the country is on the verge of collapse, it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to think the system's malignant puppeteers will stop at nothing to prevent the Trump revolution. For months, Trump's alt-right cheering section at Breitbart and elsewhere on the Internet have been stoking his followers' fears that their hero would be cheated of the presidency. That's why some tortured souls imagine President Obama will either suspend elections or somehow thwart the will of \"we the people\" this fall.\n\nThat's crazy stuff but given the fact that American popular culture has been endlessly feeding audiences such paranoid scenarios in films and TV shows since the 1960s, why should we be surprised if some people -- on both the left and the right -- are ready to buy into the notion that life will somehow imitate art in 2016?\n\nBut while, as our Max Boot correctly stated yesterday, the Obama administration must send a strong message to Russia to make them understand we won't tolerate any interference, we must at the same time recognize that there's nothing new about fears of cheating in American politics.\n\nOne of the most disingenuous arguments that Democrats have used against voter ID laws is that there is no such thing as voter fraud. In order to accept this claim, you'd have to forget much of American political history as well as everything we know about human nature. Attempts to rig elections are as old as the republic itself. Most pundits rightly disparaged Trump's comments about rigged elections. But the fact that they were uttered in Pennsylvania stems from by no means from unreasonable Republican allegations that Democrats have been using their minority voter stronghold in Philadelphia to pad their totals.\n\nBut let's also remember that the left has its own myths about cheating. Many Democrats remain convinced the 2000 election was stolen in Florida even if the evidence showed that Bush actually won the state, albeit because of a confusing ballot in one county that Republicans had no hand in creating. Liberals also made misleading claims about electronic voting machines being rigged to help Bush in 2004 and about his win in Ohio being the result of illegal manipulation.\n\nThese disputes are only remembered if the outcome of an election is close. Every time a presidential election is won by a narrow margin, claims of fraud arise. More to the point, those charges have special resonance when the two parties view each other's candidates as illegitimate. The Internet and social media have made this worse.\n\nIf worries about fraud are louder than ever this year it is because we have the two most unpopular presidential candidates in our modern history. Many Americans think Trump to be not merely wrong but unfit for the presidency. As the most recent polls demonstrate, just as many feel the same way about Hillary Clinton. No matter who prevails, the winner is going to be considered illegitimate by much of the country. Republicans may have thought John Kennedy's camp stole the 1960 election and some Democrats may have thought the same thing about Bush in 2000 and 2004. But those arguments will be nothing when compared to what will greet the election of either Trump or Clinton this year if the result is close.\n\nWhether or not the Russians do their worst or any other bad actor tries to cook the results, those who care about democracy must hope for a decisive win by either side. Anything else will only feed the perfect storm of paranoia and cynicism that has migrated from the fever swamps of American politics to the mainstream in recent years.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 26Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe Washington Post revealed on Sunday that \"U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are investigating what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in U.S. political institutions.\"\n\nIf there is such an effort under way, it would hardly be surprising. Russia has become a master of \"active measures\" in Europe, designed to spread dissension among the Western Alliance and to make the states of Eastern Europe easier picking for Russian domination. This type of information warfare has even become known as the Gerasimov Doctrine after Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces. Russia has long been suspected of backing extreme parties of both the left and the right that oppose NATO and the European Union. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, has admitted that her party has received millions of dollars in loans from a Moscow-linked bank.\n\nEvidence that Russia's intelligence services are playing a similar game in the U.S. became evident when Russian hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee computers and released 20,000 stolen emails via Wikileaks. The resulting embarrassment forced Debbie Wasserman Schultz to step down as head of the DNC on the eve of the Democratic convention.\n\nThe question is whether further Russian intrusions are coming and what form they will take. There is speculation that Russian hackers could interfere with electronic voting machines and/or release further emails stolen from the Clinton campaign or foundation. Given the pro-Russia stance of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin certainly has every incentive to help him get elected-or, failing that, to at least spread doubt about the legitimacy of the U.S. electoral process, thus further undermining American standing in the world.\n\nThe Post notes: \"Last month, the FBI issued an unprecedented warning to state election officials urging them to be on the lookout for intrusions into their election systems and to take steps to upgrade security measures across the voting process, including voter registration, voter rolls, and election-related websites. The confidential 'flash' alert said investigators had detected attempts to penetrate election systems in several states.\"\n\nAs Republican Sen. Daniel Coats of Indiana, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Post, if Moscow is trying to influence the U.S. election, \"such actions would be an outrageous violation of international rules of behavior and cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nProving that Russia is responsible may not be possible, at least not to a legal standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" because the Russian intelligence services takes care to cover their tracks. Even when hacks can be traced to Russia, it's very difficult to prove that the Kremlin was responsible. But the U.S. government doesn't need to wait for definitive proof to act, assuming, as appears likely, the evidence is already overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet no action has been forthcoming so far. The Post article notes: \"Administration officials said they are still weighing their response.\" As a friend noted in calling my attention to this line, this is \"true for almost any foreign policy challenge facing the Obama administration.\" Reflecting the professorial style of the president, this is an administration that has a tendency to talk problems to death even as they grow worse.\n\nThis Slate article provides a good rundown of possible American responses, including: public denouncement, sanctions, indictment, \"in-domain\" retaliation, harassment or \"heckling\" of Russian officials, and \"take it on the chin.\" So far the Obama administration, in this area as in so many others, is choosing the take-it-on-the-chin option. In fact one suspects that that the information-gathering now being conducted by the intelligence community can provide a convenient cover for administration inaction-how can the president possibly do anything before all the facts are in?\n\nIn reality the president normally has to act without having 100 percent knowledge. In this case it is imperative that the U.S. do something -- anything -- in response to the Russian provocations. As cyberwarfare expert Thomas Rid has noted, \"American inaction now risks establishing a de facto norm that all election campaigns in the future, everywhere, are fair game for sabotage -- sabotage that could potentially affect the outcome and tarnish the winner's legitimacy.\"\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 6Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday, in an exchange with reporters aboard his plane, Donald Trump offered up the latest in a series of baffling flip-flops on illegal immigration. When asked by a reporter whether he was ruling out a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants, Trump replied, \"I'm not ruling out anything.\" That was a reversal of the hard-line stand he took in his big immigration speech last week in Arizona, which was itself a reversal of statements made by the candidate and his campaign staff about \"softening\" the harsh positions he's been spouting since he began running for president.\n\nIf you find that confusing, you're not alone. Trump's surrogates are hard-pressed to keep pace with their man's statements and are reduced to disingenuously insisting that he's been consistent. But even amid the dishonest spin, one of them, Katrina Pierson, may have blurted out the truth this morning. She said on CNN that Trump's position wasn't a big deal because \"immigration is not showing to be a top priority for Americans in this election cycle.\" She's right about that, even if it contradicts everything Trump has said. And it's the only possible conclusion to draw from the results of the latest national poll that shows Trump gaining ground on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new CNN/ORC poll shows Trump edging ahead of Clinton by two points among likely voters. Coming from a poll that has consistently shown Clinton leading by significant margins, it should be taken seriously. Even more important are two other numbers that came out of the survey. For the first time, Clinton's unfavorable ratings exceeded those of Trump. The former secretary of state is disliked by 57 percent of Americans polled while Trump comes in at 56 percent. Both are historically high figures, but if you throw in the fact that CNN/ORC also finds that Trump is viewed as honest and trustworthy by 50 percent of Americans while only 35 percent would say the same about Clinton, then an election that seemed to be in the Democrats' pocket a few weeks ago might actually be up for grabs.\n\nThat a man who won't release his tax returns, has no principled beliefs, and has never had a position that couldn't be reversed can be viewed as honest and trustworthy boggles the mind. But in politics, as in much of life, such judgments rest primarily on the comparison with the alternative. Which is to say that after a year and a half of Democrats telling us that no one but the vast right-wing conspiracy cares about Clinton's scandals and the lies about them, their understanding of the voters' interests may be mistaken. Voters may not like Trump, nor can they count on him to do as he says. But they also care about the stench of corruption that emanates from the Clinton machine and all it touches.\n\nThe shift in polling doesn't necessarily doom Clinton. She is still leading in virtually every swing state and that edge is dragging down embattled Republican Congressional candidates to the point where the Democrats are now favored to take back control of the Senate. Her demographic edges among women, minorities, and young voters are still impressive. But it's also true that if enough Americans view her record with even more disgust than that of Trump, the turnout models that seemed to guarantee her victory in November may be flawed.\n\nClinton's decision to actually take questions from the reporters covering her campaign for the first time in several months may reflect a realization that her attempt to stonewall the press is counterproductive. This election is as much a referendum about her problems as it is about Trump's well-known flaws. Given Trump's lack of discipline, the focus may soon return to him and rescue the floundering Democrat. But in an election where both major candidates are disliked, nothing can be taken for granted.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter.

Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 10Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nNew details have emerged in recent weeks about how three Americans were freed from Iranian prisons on January 17. That very day a cargo aircraft with pallets full of $400 million in cash landed in Tehran. The Obama administration denies any connection between these two events but common sense suggests that the delivery of the money -- even if it was ostensibly to pay old claims for Iranian arms sales dating back to 1979 -- was conditioned on the release of the hostages. Hence it was, in the common understanding, a ransom.\n\nBut even as those American hostages were being released, new ones were being seized. On January 15, three American contractors working for a subsidiary of General Dynamics to train Iraqi Special Forces were seized by Shiite gunmen in Baghdad and held for a month before being released. In a fascinating interview with Hannah Allam of McClatchey, the hostages for the first time tell their story, thus shedding a bit more light on what happened.\n\nThe three men were Waiel El-Maadawy, an Egyptian-American Army veteran and former Florida sheriff's deputy; his cousin and fellow Arabic speaker, Amr Mohamed; and Russell Frost, from Wichita, Kansas. The three men were seized from an interpreter's apartment -- and had to endure the indignity of having Iraqi officials claim they were actually in a bordello. Later they had to suffer a month of torture: \"The next three weeks brought round-the-clock horror: excruciating pain and utter darkness. They were kept blindfolded and shackled in stress positions, didn't get much food and learned to urinate in empty water bottles to avoid the beatings that accompanied bathroom visits, the men said. One captor patted El-Maadawy's muscular build and told him it was a shame that 'all that was about to be worm food.' \" The three men continue to struggle with the physical and psychological toll of their ordeal to this day.\n\nAnd who was responsible for inflicting this torture on them? According to McClatchey, \"The two Arabic-speaking Americans asked their captors whether they were part of the Iraqi government. They replied that the Iraqi government 'paid them to be in charge of this neighborhood,' El-Maadawy said.... 'They were supporting the Iraqi government, augmenting the Iraqi forces,' El-Maadawy said of his captors. 'In essence, we were kidnapped by the Iraqi government.' \"\n\nBut even though they were closely linked to the Iraqi government, the Sadrist gunmen also must have had close links to the Iranian government -- ties that go unmentioned in this article. The Popular Mobilization Forces, the Shiite militia group of which these kidnappers were a part, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Iranian Quds Force. It is doubtful that the kidnappers could have held three Americans for a month without at least a tacit okay from the Iranian government -- and probably would not have released them either without an okay from Tehran.\n\nBut we know nothing about why the men were held or why they were released. This story is told strictly from the hostages' point of view; they didn't know why the Shiite militiamen decided to hold them or to release them. Was a deal struck between Washington and Tehran or between Washington and Baghdad? It did not necessarily have to be a monetary deal -- there could have been a quid pro quo of some kind. We simply don't know. If Congress is going to probe the $400 million payment to Tehran, it should probe the contractors' kidnapping as well, along with the more recent seizure of further dual-national Iranians to replace the ones that have been released.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

The Chinese refused to let U.S. personnel roll out the standard stairway transported around the world for the presidential airplane. Then, when the president exited via a set of stairs in the belly of the aircraft, there was a scrum on the tarmac with Chinese personnel preventing National Security Adviser Susan Rice from reaching the presidential party. At one point a Chinese official loudly exclaimed to an American: \"This is our country, this is our airport.\" As noted in a news account:\n\nThe official's fury, caught on a cell phone and widely circulated, won glowing approval on one of China's most powerful government social media sites.\n\nOn Weibo, the equivalent of Twitter, the Public Security Bureau declared: \"This is our country.\"\n\n\"Yup, this is very China!\" the account, which has 24 million followers, noted as it showed a clip of Mr. Obama descending the small staircase. The comments on such sites appear only after passing censors.\n\nAt the same time that all of this was going on in Hangzhou, Chinese vessels have been swarming around Scarborough Shoal, a disputed rock formation in the South China Sea that China has claimed as its own territory, even though that claim has been soundly rejected by an international tribunal in the Hague.\n\nWhat links these two events? What accounts for these ill-tempered displays of Chinese nationalism?\n\nIt all goes back to the 19th century when China, which had long seen itself as the center of the civilized universe, experienced the shock and humiliation of being defeated by the British in the First Opium War (1839-1842). The result of China's military weakness was to allow many of the European powers, along with the United States and China, to establish extra-territorial privileges on its soil. Major Chinese cities such as Shanghai became virtual colonies under the occupation of various Western armies.\n\nNever mind that China greatly benefitted from this arrangement, at least in economic terms: Its industrialization and urbanization was kick-started by Western investment. Shanghai, for one, was a mere village before Westerners transformed it into one of the world's great cities. Nevertheless for Chinese patriots the subsidiary position their country had to accept in the world deeply rankled.\n\nPopular anger about China's humiliation helped propel the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and the republic that replaced the imperial regime. Mao Zedong and his Communists also utilized this sentiment in their drive to seize power from the Nationalist regime and the warlords who dominated China in the period between the two world wars. Mao painted Chiang Kai-shek and lesser warlords as mere lackeys of the Western and Japanese imperialists and capitalists and promised to restore Chinese greatness while also erasing distinctions between rich and poor and making everyone prosperous.\n\nFast forward to today-67 years after the revolution that brought the Communists to power. Mao's successors have made the country far richer than he could have imagined; GDP per capita has gone from $88 in 1960 to $7,924 in 2015, while total GDP has gone from $59 billion to $10.8 trillion. China is on the verge of surpassing the U.S. as the world's largest economy.\n\nYet even as China has become the go-to producer of electronics and lots of other goods, its No. 1 manufacturing industry has remained the same: It specializes in producing chips for shoulders. Specifically chips for the shoulders of Chinese people who are constantly reminded of the humiliation they have suffered in the past at the hands of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese. The Communist Party's not-so-subtle appeal is that only it can protect the Chinese from further humiliation in the future; only the Party can keep China together and make it as strong and respected and rich as it deserves to be.\n\nHence Chinese jubilation over a petty slight to the president of the United States and to a bigger and more significant slight to China's neighbors and the rule of law in the South China Sea. The Chinese anger and pride is real but it is also kept at a fever-pitch by Xi Jinping and the ruling Politburo. They know they need to keep stoking the flames of Chinese nationalism in order to provide a rationale for them and their families to enjoy complete control over 1.3 billion people-and the spoils that come with it.\n\nSo while \"stairgate\" is not very significant for its own sake, it is significant for what it says about China and its future-and what it says is pretty disturbing. China is a state with growing military and economic power, and yet its sense of being wronged by the world remains undiminished no matter how much success it enjoys. That is all too reminiscent of Kaiser Wilhelm II's Germany prior to 1914. History doesn't have to repeat itself; we are not doomed to fight a world war against China. But if we are to avoid such a conflict, it will require a hard-headed recognition of just how dangerous and volatile today's situation is, rather than succumbing to happy talk about Chinese-American cooperation on climate change and other matters.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business.

                    "body": "Campaigns & Elections Who's Trying to Steal the Election? Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-07 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 7, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nA month ago, Donald Trump openly declared that he believed the election would be rigged against him. But now Trump and his followers aren't the only ones worrying about the integrity of the election. The Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee raises serious questions about just how far Moscow would go to help Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton because of Trump's open advocacy of appeasement of the Vladimir Putin regime. Add to that other legitimate concerns that have been discussed in the media about the security of electronic voting and reporting systems and you've got the makings of a terrible controversy if, as today's national polls indicate, the presidential election turns out to be close.\n\nTrump's talk of a rigged election fit in neatly with his dark vision of America as a corrupt nation in decline. For those who truly believe the country is on the verge of collapse, it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to think the system's malignant puppeteers will stop at nothing to prevent the Trump revolution. For months, Trump's alt-right cheering section at Breitbart and elsewhere on the Internet have been stoking his followers' fears that their hero would be cheated of the presidency. That's why some tortured souls imagine President Obama will either suspend elections or somehow thwart the will of \"we the people\" this fall.\n\nThat's crazy stuff but given the fact that American popular culture has been endlessly feeding audiences such paranoid scenarios in films and TV shows since the 1960s, why should we be surprised if some people -- on both the left and the right -- are ready to buy into the notion that life will somehow imitate art in 2016?\n\nBut while, as our Max Boot correctly stated yesterday, the Obama administration must send a strong message to Russia to make them understand we won't tolerate any interference, we must at the same time recognize that there's nothing new about fears of cheating in American politics.\n\nOne of the most disingenuous arguments that Democrats have used against voter ID laws is that there is no such thing as voter fraud. In order to accept this claim, you'd have to forget much of American political history as well as everything we know about human nature. Attempts to rig elections are as old as the republic itself. Most pundits rightly disparaged Trump's comments about rigged elections. But the fact that they were uttered in Pennsylvania stems from by no means from unreasonable Republican allegations that Democrats have been using their minority voter stronghold in Philadelphia to pad their totals.\n\nBut let's also remember that the left has its own myths about cheating. Many Democrats remain convinced the 2000 election was stolen in Florida even if the evidence showed that Bush actually won the state, albeit because of a confusing ballot in one county that Republicans had no hand in creating. Liberals also made misleading claims about electronic voting machines being rigged to help Bush in 2004 and about his win in Ohio being the result of illegal manipulation.\n\nThese disputes are only remembered if the outcome of an election is close. Every time a presidential election is won by a narrow margin, claims of fraud arise. More to the point, those charges have special resonance when the two parties view each other's candidates as illegitimate. The Internet and social media have made this worse.\n\nIf worries about fraud are louder than ever this year it is because we have the two most unpopular presidential candidates in our modern history. Many Americans think Trump to be not merely wrong but unfit for the presidency. As the most recent polls demonstrate, just as many feel the same way about Hillary Clinton. No matter who prevails, the winner is going to be considered illegitimate by much of the country. Republicans may have thought John Kennedy's camp stole the 1960 election and some Democrats may have thought the same thing about Bush in 2000 and 2004. But those arguments will be nothing when compared to what will greet the election of either Trump or Clinton this year if the result is close.\n\nWhether or not the Russians do their worst or any other bad actor tries to cook the results, those who care about democracy must hope for a decisive win by either side. Anything else will only feed the perfect storm of paranoia and cynicism that has migrated from the fever swamps of American politics to the mainstream in recent years.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 25Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe Washington Post revealed on Sunday that \"U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are investigating what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in U.S. political institutions.\"\n\nIf there is such an effort under way, it would hardly be surprising. Russia has become a master of \"active measures\" in Europe, designed to spread dissension among the Western Alliance and to make the states of Eastern Europe easier picking for Russian domination. This type of information warfare has even become known as the Gerasimov Doctrine after Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces. Russia has long been suspected of backing extreme parties of both the left and the right that oppose NATO and the European Union. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, has admitted that her party has received millions of dollars in loans from a Moscow-linked bank.\n\nEvidence that Russia's intelligence services are playing a similar game in the U.S. became evident when Russian hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee computers and released 20,000 stolen emails via Wikileaks. The resulting embarrassment forced Debbie Wasserman Schultz to step down as head of the DNC on the eve of the Democratic convention.\n\nThe question is whether further Russian intrusions are coming and what form they will take. There is speculation that Russian hackers could interfere with electronic voting machines and/or release further emails stolen from the Clinton campaign or foundation. Given the pro-Russia stance of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin certainly has every incentive to help him get elected-or, failing that, to at least spread doubt about the legitimacy of the U.S. electoral process, thus further undermining American standing in the world.\n\nThe Post notes: \"Last month, the FBI issued an unprecedented warning to state election officials urging them to be on the lookout for intrusions into their election systems and to take steps to upgrade security measures across the voting process, including voter registration, voter rolls, and election-related websites. The confidential 'flash' alert said investigators had detected attempts to penetrate election systems in several states.\"\n\nAs Republican Sen. Daniel Coats of Indiana, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Post, if Moscow is trying to influence the U.S. election, \"such actions would be an outrageous violation of international rules of behavior and cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nProving that Russia is responsible may not be possible, at least not to a legal standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" because the Russian intelligence services takes care to cover their tracks. Even when hacks can be traced to Russia, it's very difficult to prove that the Kremlin was responsible. But the U.S. government doesn't need to wait for definitive proof to act, assuming, as appears likely, the evidence is already overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet no action has been forthcoming so far. The Post article notes: \"Administration officials said they are still weighing their response.\" As a friend noted in calling my attention to this line, this is \"true for almost any foreign policy challenge facing the Obama administration.\" Reflecting the professorial style of the president, this is an administration that has a tendency to talk problems to death even as they grow worse.\n\nThis Slate article provides a good rundown of possible American responses, including: public denouncement, sanctions, indictment, \"in-domain\" retaliation, harassment or \"heckling\" of Russian officials, and \"take it on the chin.\" So far the Obama administration, in this area as in so many others, is choosing the take-it-on-the-chin option. In fact one suspects that that the information-gathering now being conducted by the intelligence community can provide a convenient cover for administration inaction-how can the president possibly do anything before all the facts are in?\n\nIn reality the president normally has to act without having 100 percent knowledge. In this case it is imperative that the U.S. do something -- anything -- in response to the Russian provocations. As cyberwarfare expert Thomas Rid has noted, \"American inaction now risks establishing a de facto norm that all election campaigns in the future, everywhere, are fair game for sabotage -- sabotage that could potentially affect the outcome and tarnish the winner's legitimacy.\"\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 5Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday, in an exchange with reporters aboard his plane, Donald Trump offered up the latest in a series of baffling flip-flops on illegal immigration. When asked by a reporter whether he was ruling out a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants, Trump replied, \"I'm not ruling out anything.\" That was a reversal of the hard-line stand he took in his big immigration speech last week in Arizona, which was itself a reversal of statements made by the candidate and his campaign staff about \"softening\" the harsh positions he's been spouting since he began running for president.\n\nIf you find that confusing, you're not alone. Trump's surrogates are hard-pressed to keep pace with their man's statements and are reduced to disingenuously insisting that he's been consistent. But even amid the dishonest spin, one of them, Katrina Pierson, may have blurted out the truth this morning. She said on CNN that Trump's position wasn't a big deal because \"immigration is not showing to be a top priority for Americans in this election cycle.\" She's right about that, even if it contradicts everything Trump has said. And it's the only possible conclusion to draw from the results of the latest national poll that shows Trump gaining ground on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new CNN/ORC poll shows Trump edging ahead of Clinton by two points among likely voters. Coming from a poll that has consistently shown Clinton leading by significant margins, it should be taken seriously. Even more important are two other numbers that came out of the survey. For the first time, Clinton's unfavorable ratings exceeded those of Trump. The former secretary of state is disliked by 57 percent of Americans polled while Trump comes in at 56 percent. Both are historically high figures, but if you throw in the fact that CNN/ORC also finds that Trump is viewed as honest and trustworthy by 50 percent of Americans while only 35 percent would say the same about Clinton, then an election that seemed to be in the Democrats' pocket a few weeks ago might actually be up for grabs.\n\nThat a man who won't release his tax returns, has no principled beliefs, and has never had a position that couldn't be reversed can be viewed as honest and trustworthy boggles the mind. But in politics, as in much of life, such judgments rest primarily on the comparison with the alternative. Which is to say that after a year and a half of Democrats telling us that no one but the vast right-wing conspiracy cares about Clinton's scandals and the lies about them, their understanding of the voters' interests may be mistaken. Voters may not like Trump, nor can they count on him to do as he says. But they also care about the stench of corruption that emanates from the Clinton machine and all it touches.\n\nThe shift in polling doesn't necessarily doom Clinton. She is still leading in virtually every swing state and that edge is dragging down embattled Republican Congressional candidates to the point where the Democrats are now favored to take back control of the Senate. Her demographic edges among women, minorities, and young voters are still impressive. But it's also true that if enough Americans view her record with even more disgust than that of Trump, the turnout models that seemed to guarantee her victory in November may be flawed.\n\nClinton's decision to actually take questions from the reporters covering her campaign for the first time in several months may reflect a realization that her attempt to stonewall the press is counterproductive. This election is as much a referendum about her problems as it is about Trump's well-known flaws. Given Trump's lack of discipline, the focus may soon return to him and rescue the floundering Democrat. But in an election where both major candidates are disliked, nothing can be taken for granted.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 10Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nNew details have emerged in recent weeks about how three Americans were freed from Iranian prisons on January 17. That very day a cargo aircraft with pallets full of $400 million in cash landed in Tehran. The Obama administration denies any connection between these two events but common sense suggests that the delivery of the money -- even if it was ostensibly to pay old claims for Iranian arms sales dating back to 1979 -- was conditioned on the release of the hostages. Hence it was, in the common understanding, a ransom.\n\nBut even as those American hostages were being released, new ones were being seized. On January 15, three American contractors working for a subsidiary of General Dynamics to train Iraqi Special Forces were seized by Shiite gunmen in Baghdad and held for a month before being released. In a fascinating interview with Hannah Allam of McClatchey, the hostages for the first time tell their story, thus shedding a bit more light on what happened.\n\nThe three men were Waiel El-Maadawy, an Egyptian-American Army veteran and former Florida sheriff's deputy; his cousin and fellow Arabic speaker, Amr Mohamed; and Russell Frost, from Wichita, Kansas. The three men were seized from an interpreter's apartment -- and had to endure the indignity of having Iraqi officials claim they were actually in a bordello. Later they had to suffer a month of torture: \"The next three weeks brought round-the-clock horror: excruciating pain and utter darkness. They were kept blindfolded and shackled in stress positions, didn't get much food and learned to urinate in empty water bottles to avoid the beatings that accompanied bathroom visits, the men said. One captor patted El-Maadawy's muscular build and told him it was a shame that 'all that was about to be worm food.' \" The three men continue to struggle with the physical and psychological toll of their ordeal to this day.\n\nAnd who was responsible for inflicting this torture on them? According to McClatchey, \"The two Arabic-speaking Americans asked their captors whether they were part of the Iraqi government. They replied that the Iraqi government 'paid them to be in charge of this neighborhood,' El-Maadawy said.... 'They were supporting the Iraqi government, augmenting the Iraqi forces,' El-Maadawy said of his captors. 'In essence, we were kidnapped by the Iraqi government.' \"\n\nBut even though they were closely linked to the Iraqi government, the Sadrist gunmen also must have had close links to the Iranian government -- ties that go unmentioned in this article. The Popular Mobilization Forces, the Shiite militia group of which these kidnappers were a part, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Iranian Quds Force. It is doubtful that the kidnappers could have held three Americans for a month without at least a tacit okay from the Iranian government -- and probably would not have released them either without an okay from Tehran.\n\nBut we know nothing about why the men were held or why they were released. This story is told strictly from the hostages' point of view; they didn't know why the Shiite militiamen decided to hold them or to release them. Was a deal struck between Washington and Tehran or between Washington and Baghdad? It did not necessarily have to be a monetary deal -- there could have been a quid pro quo of some kind. We simply don't know. If Congress is going to probe the $400 million payment to Tehran, it should probe the contractors' kidnapping as well, along with the more recent seizure of further dual-national Iranians to replace the ones that have been released.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis.

The Chinese refused to let U.S. personnel roll out the standard stairway transported around the world for the presidential airplane. Then, when the president exited via a set of stairs in the belly of the aircraft, there was a scrum on the tarmac with Chinese personnel preventing National Security Adviser Susan Rice from reaching the presidential party. At one point a Chinese official loudly exclaimed to an American: \"This is our country, this is our airport.\" As noted in a news account:\n\nThe official's fury, caught on a cell phone and widely circulated, won glowing approval on one of China's most powerful government social media sites.\n\nOn Weibo, the equivalent of Twitter, the Public Security Bureau declared: \"This is our country.\"\n\n\"Yup, this is very China!\" the account, which has 24 million followers, noted as it showed a clip of Mr. Obama descending the small staircase. The comments on such sites appear only after passing censors.\n\nAt the same time that all of this was going on in Hangzhou, Chinese vessels have been swarming around Scarborough Shoal, a disputed rock formation in the South China Sea that China has claimed as its own territory, even though that claim has been soundly rejected by an international tribunal in the Hague.\n\nWhat links these two events? What accounts for these ill-tempered displays of Chinese nationalism?\n\nIt all goes back to the 19th century when China, which had long seen itself as the center of the civilized universe, experienced the shock and humiliation of being defeated by the British in the First Opium War (1839-1842). The result of China's military weakness was to allow many of the European powers, along with the United States and China, to establish extra-territorial privileges on its soil. Major Chinese cities such as Shanghai became virtual colonies under the occupation of various Western armies.\n\nNever mind that China greatly benefitted from this arrangement, at least in economic terms: Its industrialization and urbanization was kick-started by Western investment. Shanghai, for one, was a mere village before Westerners transformed it into one of the world's great cities. Nevertheless for Chinese patriots the subsidiary position their country had to accept in the world deeply rankled.\n\nPopular anger about China's humiliation helped propel the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and the republic that replaced the imperial regime. Mao Zedong and his Communists also utilized this sentiment in their drive to seize power from the Nationalist regime and the warlords who dominated China in the period between the two world wars. Mao painted Chiang Kai-shek and lesser warlords as mere lackeys of the Western and Japanese imperialists and capitalists and promised to restore Chinese greatness while also erasing distinctions between rich and poor and making everyone prosperous.\n\nFast forward to today-67 years after the revolution that brought the Communists to power. Mao's successors have made the country far richer than he could have imagined; GDP per capita has gone from $88 in 1960 to $7,924 in 2015, while total GDP has gone from $59 billion to $10.8 trillion. China is on the verge of surpassing the U.S. as the world's largest economy.\n\nYet even as China has become the go-to producer of electronics and lots of other goods, its No. 1 manufacturing industry has remained the same: It specializes in producing chips for shoulders. Specifically chips for the shoulders of Chinese people who are constantly reminded of the humiliation they have suffered in the past at the hands of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese. The Communist Party's not-so-subtle appeal is that only it can protect the Chinese from further humiliation in the future; only the Party can keep China together and make it as strong and respected and rich as it deserves to be.\n\nHence Chinese jubilation over a petty slight to the president of the United States and to a bigger and more significant slight to China's neighbors and the rule of law in the South China Sea. The Chinese anger and pride is real but it is also kept at a fever-pitch by Xi Jinping and the ruling Politburo. They know they need to keep stoking the flames of Chinese nationalism in order to provide a rationale for them and their families to enjoy complete control over 1.3 billion people-and the spoils that come with it.\n\nSo while \"stairgate\" is not very significant for its own sake, it is significant for what it says about China and its future-and what it says is pretty disturbing. China is a state with growing military and economic power, and yet its sense of being wronged by the world remains undiminished no matter how much success it enjoys. That is all too reminiscent of Kaiser Wilhelm II's Germany prior to 1914. History doesn't have to repeat itself; we are not doomed to fight a world war against China. But if we are to avoid such a conflict, it will require a hard-headed recognition of just how dangerous and volatile today's situation is, rather than succumbing to happy talk about Chinese-American cooperation on climate change and other matters.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:Barack ObamaChinaU.S.-China relations29Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles: Syria An Immoral Consensus on Syria Jonathan S. Tobin 2016-09-06 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 11Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nEvery once in a while one of the New York Times stumbles upon a great truth. That was the case with the piece featured on their front page on Monday, in which Mark Landler and Mark Mazzetti note that the abysmal failure of the Obama administration's Syria policy is being largely ignored by the American public and the two presidential candidates.\n\nThe article correctly states that Washington viewed the \"charnel house\" that is Syria as a \"distant disaster rather than an urgent crisis.\" More to the point, in spite of what the Obama cheering section at the Times acknowledges is an unmitigated disaster, the administration is facing no pressure to change course.\n\nObama's burden of guilt for the humanitarian disaster in Syria has been compounded by his decision to punt responsibility for the mess to Russia. Vladimir Putin, seeking to resurrect the old Soviet empire, is committed to keeping his client, the Assad regime, in power. Assad's forces (along with his Iranian, Hezbollah and Russian allies) are primarily responsible not only for the bulk of atrocities but for the Sunni population's support for ISIS and other radical groups that are perceived as their only defenders.\n\nObama refused to take action in the early days of the civil war and stuck to that stand even when Assad crossed Obama's \"red line\" and used chemical weapons. The president's inaction stemmed in part from a desire to appease both Russia and Iran. We now know that that the Russian agreement on Assad's chemical weapons was a farce and that he continues to use these illegal arms. As the bloodshed continues to take its toll, all Obama can do is to futilely advocate for a cease-fire that neither Assad nor the Russians want since the war has shifted in their favor.\n\nAs the Times aptly notes, there is no \"Plan B\" for the administration to fall back upon as Secretary of State John Kerry's pleas fall on deaf ears in Moscow, Damascus, and Tehran. Anonymous U.S. officials say that the president is not interested in expanding U.S. aid to those rebels in Syria who are fighting against Assad, ISIS, and other Islamist forces. While the fighting is increasingly confused, especially in places like besieged Aleppo, the rebels being supplied by the CIA should not be confused with al Qaeda elements that go under the name of the Nusra Front. Obama's decision clearly means that Kerry's efforts at brokering a cease-fire are a cover for the U.S. to abandon Syria to the Russians, a move that will likely lead to more mass killings.\n\nWhat do Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton have to offer in response to this disgrace? Nothing.\n\nDespite his continual abuse of President Obama, Trump's policies seem closely aligned with those of the administration. Trump's advocacy for appeasing Russia would actually mean a continuation of current policies that hinge on the abandonment of U.S. responsibilities in the region. This is unaffected by his criticism of Iran (which contradicts his stand on Russia), lip service paid to support for Israel, and chest pounding about fighting ISIS.\n\nIn private, Clinton is reportedly again resurrecting her past support for a no-fly zone in Syria (which Obama rejected). But, in public, she is careful to allow no daylight between herself and Obama. Nor is it likely that a President Clinton would lead a liberal Democratic administration into the sort of use of force that might actually cause the Assad/Russian/Iranian coalition to stop killing people or allow a change of power in Damascus that is a prerequisite for defeating ISIS.\n\nBoth campaigns believe the American people don't care about Syria no matter how many die there or how piteous the pictures of its victims. Unfortunately, they appear to be right. To the extent that anyone is paying any attention to Syria it is to participate in a dishonest debate about refugees that pits unrealistic liberal altruism against a realistic, but myopic, fear of terror.\n\nLeadership and a sense of moral responsibility from the White House about Syria might have provided the only possible answer to such apathy and dishonesty. There is as little hope for that in January as there is now with Obama in office.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers.

                    "body": "Russia Will Obama Act on Russian Hacking? Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThe Washington Post revealed on Sunday that \"U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are investigating what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in U.S. political institutions.\"\n\nIf there is such an effort under way, it would hardly be surprising. Russia has become a master of \"active measures\" in Europe, designed to spread dissension among the Western Alliance and to make the states of Eastern Europe easier picking for Russian domination. This type of information warfare has even become known as the Gerasimov Doctrine after Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces. Russia has long been suspected of backing extreme parties of both the left and the right that oppose NATO and the European Union. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, has admitted that her party has received millions of dollars in loans from a Moscow-linked bank.\n\nEvidence that Russia's intelligence services are playing a similar game in the U.S. became evident when Russian hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee computers and released 20,000 stolen emails via Wikileaks. The resulting embarrassment forced Debbie Wasserman Schultz to step down as head of the DNC on the eve of the Democratic convention.\n\nThe question is whether further Russian intrusions are coming and what form they will take. There is speculation that Russian hackers could interfere with electronic voting machines and/or release further emails stolen from the Clinton campaign or foundation. Given the pro-Russia stance of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin certainly has every incentive to help him get elected-or, failing that, to at least spread doubt about the legitimacy of the U.S. electoral process, thus further undermining American standing in the world.\n\nThe Post notes: \"Last month, the FBI issued an unprecedented warning to state election officials urging them to be on the lookout for intrusions into their election systems and to take steps to upgrade security measures across the voting process, including voter registration, voter rolls, and election-related websites. The confidential 'flash' alert said investigators had detected attempts to penetrate election systems in several states.\"\n\nAs Republican Sen. Daniel Coats of Indiana, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Post, if Moscow is trying to influence the U.S. election, \"such actions would be an outrageous violation of international rules of behavior and cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nProving that Russia is responsible may not be possible, at least not to a legal standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" because the Russian intelligence services takes care to cover their tracks. Even when hacks can be traced to Russia, it's very difficult to prove that the Kremlin was responsible. But the U.S. government doesn't need to wait for definitive proof to act, assuming, as appears likely, the evidence is already overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet no action has been forthcoming so far. The Post article notes: \"Administration officials said they are still weighing their response.\" As a friend noted in calling my attention to this line, this is \"true for almost any foreign policy challenge facing the Obama administration.\" Reflecting the professorial style of the president, this is an administration that has a tendency to talk problems to death even as they grow worse.\n\nThis Slate article provides a good rundown of possible American responses, including: public denouncement, sanctions, indictment, \"in-domain\" retaliation, harassment or \"heckling\" of Russian officials, and \"take it on the chin.\" So far the Obama administration, in this area as in so many others, is choosing the take-it-on-the-chin option. In fact one suspects that that the information-gathering now being conducted by the intelligence community can provide a convenient cover for administration inaction-how can the president possibly do anything before all the facts are in?\n\nIn reality the president normally has to act without having 100 percent knowledge. In this case it is imperative that the U.S. do something -- anything -- in response to the Russian provocations. As cyberwarfare expert Thomas Rid has noted, \"American inaction now risks establishing a de facto norm that all election campaigns in the future, everywhere, are fair game for sabotage -- sabotage that could potentially affect the outcome and tarnish the winner's legitimacy.\"\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Herefiled under:cyberwarfareRussian hackingU.S.-Russia relations0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:Will Obama Act on Russian Hacking?Must-Reads from Magazine Campaigns & Elections What Voters Care About Jonathan S.

Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday, in an exchange with reporters aboard his plane, Donald Trump offered up the latest in a series of baffling flip-flops on illegal immigration. When asked by a reporter whether he was ruling out a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants, Trump replied, \"I'm not ruling out anything.\" That was a reversal of the hard-line stand he took in his big immigration speech last week in Arizona, which was itself a reversal of statements made by the candidate and his campaign staff about \"softening\" the harsh positions he's been spouting since he began running for president.\n\nIf you find that confusing, you're not alone. Trump's surrogates are hard-pressed to keep pace with their man's statements and are reduced to disingenuously insisting that he's been consistent. But even amid the dishonest spin, one of them, Katrina Pierson, may have blurted out the truth this morning. She said on CNN that Trump's position wasn't a big deal because \"immigration is not showing to be a top priority for Americans in this election cycle.\" She's right about that, even if it contradicts everything Trump has said. And it's the only possible conclusion to draw from the results of the latest national poll that shows Trump gaining ground on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new CNN/ORC poll shows Trump edging ahead of Clinton by two points among likely voters. Coming from a poll that has consistently shown Clinton leading by significant margins, it should be taken seriously. Even more important are two other numbers that came out of the survey. For the first time, Clinton's unfavorable ratings exceeded those of Trump. The former secretary of state is disliked by 57 percent of Americans polled while Trump comes in at 56 percent. Both are historically high figures, but if you throw in the fact that CNN/ORC also finds that Trump is viewed as honest and trustworthy by 50 percent of Americans while only 35 percent would say the same about Clinton, then an election that seemed to be in the Democrats' pocket a few weeks ago might actually be up for grabs.\n\nThat a man who won't release his tax returns, has no principled beliefs, and has never had a position that couldn't be reversed can be viewed as honest and trustworthy boggles the mind. But in politics, as in much of life, such judgments rest primarily on the comparison with the alternative. Which is to say that after a year and a half of Democrats telling us that no one but the vast right-wing conspiracy cares about Clinton's scandals and the lies about them, their understanding of the voters' interests may be mistaken. Voters may not like Trump, nor can they count on him to do as he says. But they also care about the stench of corruption that emanates from the Clinton machine and all it touches.\n\nThe shift in polling doesn't necessarily doom Clinton. She is still leading in virtually every swing state and that edge is dragging down embattled Republican Congressional candidates to the point where the Democrats are now favored to take back control of the Senate. Her demographic edges among women, minorities, and young voters are still impressive. But it's also true that if enough Americans view her record with even more disgust than that of Trump, the turnout models that seemed to guarantee her victory in November may be flawed.\n\nClinton's decision to actually take questions from the reporters covering her campaign for the first time in several months may reflect a realization that her attempt to stonewall the press is counterproductive. This election is as much a referendum about her problems as it is about Trump's well-known flaws. Given Trump's lack of discipline, the focus may soon return to him and rescue the floundering Democrat.

Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth.

When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument.

Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 4Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nNew details have emerged in recent weeks about how three Americans were freed from Iranian prisons on January 17. That very day a cargo aircraft with pallets full of $400 million in cash landed in Tehran. The Obama administration denies any connection between these two events but common sense suggests that the delivery of the money -- even if it was ostensibly to pay old claims for Iranian arms sales dating back to 1979 -- was conditioned on the release of the hostages. Hence it was, in the common understanding, a ransom.\n\nBut even as those American hostages were being released, new ones were being seized. On January 15, three American contractors working for a subsidiary of General Dynamics to train Iraqi Special Forces were seized by Shiite gunmen in Baghdad and held for a month before being released. In a fascinating interview with Hannah Allam of McClatchey, the hostages for the first time tell their story, thus shedding a bit more light on what happened.\n\nThe three men were Waiel El-Maadawy, an Egyptian-American Army veteran and former Florida sheriff's deputy; his cousin and fellow Arabic speaker, Amr Mohamed; and Russell Frost, from Wichita, Kansas. The three men were seized from an interpreter's apartment -- and had to endure the indignity of having Iraqi officials claim they were actually in a bordello. Later they had to suffer a month of torture: \"The next three weeks brought round-the-clock horror: excruciating pain and utter darkness. They were kept blindfolded and shackled in stress positions, didn't get much food and learned to urinate in empty water bottles to avoid the beatings that accompanied bathroom visits, the men said. One captor patted El-Maadawy's muscular build and told him it was a shame that 'all that was about to be worm food.' \" The three men continue to struggle with the physical and psychological toll of their ordeal to this day.\n\nAnd who was responsible for inflicting this torture on them? According to McClatchey, \"The two Arabic-speaking Americans asked their captors whether they were part of the Iraqi government. They replied that the Iraqi government 'paid them to be in charge of this neighborhood,' El-Maadawy said.... 'They were supporting the Iraqi government, augmenting the Iraqi forces,' El-Maadawy said of his captors. 'In essence, we were kidnapped by the Iraqi government.' \"\n\nBut even though they were closely linked to the Iraqi government, the Sadrist gunmen also must have had close links to the Iranian government -- ties that go unmentioned in this article. The Popular Mobilization Forces, the Shiite militia group of which these kidnappers were a part, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Iranian Quds Force. It is doubtful that the kidnappers could have held three Americans for a month without at least a tacit okay from the Iranian government -- and probably would not have released them either without an okay from Tehran.\n\nBut we know nothing about why the men were held or why they were released. This story is told strictly from the hostages' point of view; they didn't know why the Shiite militiamen decided to hold them or to release them. Was a deal struck between Washington and Tehran or between Washington and Baghdad? It did not necessarily have to be a monetary deal -- there could have been a quid pro quo of some kind. We simply don't know. If Congress is going to probe the $400 million payment to Tehran, it should probe the contractors' kidnapping as well, along with the more recent seizure of further dual-national Iranians to replace the ones that have been released.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

The Chinese refused to let U.S. personnel roll out the standard stairway transported around the world for the presidential airplane. Then, when the president exited via a set of stairs in the belly of the aircraft, there was a scrum on the tarmac with Chinese personnel preventing National Security Adviser Susan Rice from reaching the presidential party. At one point a Chinese official loudly exclaimed to an American: \"This is our country, this is our airport.\" As noted in a news account:\n\nThe official's fury, caught on a cell phone and widely circulated, won glowing approval on one of China's most powerful government social media sites.\n\nOn Weibo, the equivalent of Twitter, the Public Security Bureau declared: \"This is our country.\"\n\n\"Yup, this is very China!\" the account, which has 24 million followers, noted as it showed a clip of Mr. Obama descending the small staircase. The comments on such sites appear only after passing censors.\n\nAt the same time that all of this was going on in Hangzhou, Chinese vessels have been swarming around Scarborough Shoal, a disputed rock formation in the South China Sea that China has claimed as its own territory, even though that claim has been soundly rejected by an international tribunal in the Hague.\n\nWhat links these two events? What accounts for these ill-tempered displays of Chinese nationalism?\n\nIt all goes back to the 19th century when China, which had long seen itself as the center of the civilized universe, experienced the shock and humiliation of being defeated by the British in the First Opium War (1839-1842). The result of China's military weakness was to allow many of the European powers, along with the United States and China, to establish extra-territorial privileges on its soil. Major Chinese cities such as Shanghai became virtual colonies under the occupation of various Western armies.\n\nNever mind that China greatly benefitted from this arrangement, at least in economic terms: Its industrialization and urbanization was kick-started by Western investment. Shanghai, for one, was a mere village before Westerners transformed it into one of the world's great cities. Nevertheless for Chinese patriots the subsidiary position their country had to accept in the world deeply rankled.\n\nPopular anger about China's humiliation helped propel the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and the republic that replaced the imperial regime. Mao Zedong and his Communists also utilized this sentiment in their drive to seize power from the Nationalist regime and the warlords who dominated China in the period between the two world wars. Mao painted Chiang Kai-shek and lesser warlords as mere lackeys of the Western and Japanese imperialists and capitalists and promised to restore Chinese greatness while also erasing distinctions between rich and poor and making everyone prosperous.\n\nFast forward to today-67 years after the revolution that brought the Communists to power. Mao's successors have made the country far richer than he could have imagined; GDP per capita has gone from $88 in 1960 to $7,924 in 2015, while total GDP has gone from $59 billion to $10.8 trillion. China is on the verge of surpassing the U.S. as the world's largest economy.\n\nYet even as China has become the go-to producer of electronics and lots of other goods, its No. 1 manufacturing industry has remained the same: It specializes in producing chips for shoulders. Specifically chips for the shoulders of Chinese people who are constantly reminded of the humiliation they have suffered in the past at the hands of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese. The Communist Party's not-so-subtle appeal is that only it can protect the Chinese from further humiliation in the future; only the Party can keep China together and make it as strong and respected and rich as it deserves to be.\n\nHence Chinese jubilation over a petty slight to the president of the United States and to a bigger and more significant slight to China's neighbors and the rule of law in the South China Sea. The Chinese anger and pride is real but it is also kept at a fever-pitch by Xi Jinping and the ruling Politburo. They know they need to keep stoking the flames of Chinese nationalism in order to provide a rationale for them and their families to enjoy complete control over 1.3 billion people-and the spoils that come with it.\n\nSo while \"stairgate\" is not very significant for its own sake, it is significant for what it says about China and its future-and what it says is pretty disturbing. China is a state with growing military and economic power, and yet its sense of being wronged by the world remains undiminished no matter how much success it enjoys. That is all too reminiscent of Kaiser Wilhelm II's Germany prior to 1914. History doesn't have to repeat itself; we are not doomed to fight a world war against China. But if we are to avoid such a conflict, it will require a hard-headed recognition of just how dangerous and volatile today's situation is, rather than succumbing to happy talk about Chinese-American cooperation on climate change and other matters.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin 2016-09-06 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 9Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nEvery once in a while one of the New York Times stumbles upon a great truth. That was the case with the piece featured on their front page on Monday, in which Mark Landler and Mark Mazzetti note that the abysmal failure of the Obama administration's Syria policy is being largely ignored by the American public and the two presidential candidates.\n\nThe article correctly states that Washington viewed the \"charnel house\" that is Syria as a \"distant disaster rather than an urgent crisis.\" More to the point, in spite of what the Obama cheering section at the Times acknowledges is an unmitigated disaster, the administration is facing no pressure to change course.\n\nObama's burden of guilt for the humanitarian disaster in Syria has been compounded by his decision to punt responsibility for the mess to Russia. Vladimir Putin, seeking to resurrect the old Soviet empire, is committed to keeping his client, the Assad regime, in power. Assad's forces (along with his Iranian, Hezbollah and Russian allies) are primarily responsible not only for the bulk of atrocities but for the Sunni population's support for ISIS and other radical groups that are perceived as their only defenders.\n\nObama refused to take action in the early days of the civil war and stuck to that stand even when Assad crossed Obama's \"red line\" and used chemical weapons. The president's inaction stemmed in part from a desire to appease both Russia and Iran. We now know that that the Russian agreement on Assad's chemical weapons was a farce and that he continues to use these illegal arms. As the bloodshed continues to take its toll, all Obama can do is to futilely advocate for a cease-fire that neither Assad nor the Russians want since the war has shifted in their favor.\n\nAs the Times aptly notes, there is no \"Plan B\" for the administration to fall back upon as Secretary of State John Kerry's pleas fall on deaf ears in Moscow, Damascus, and Tehran. Anonymous U.S. officials say that the president is not interested in expanding U.S. aid to those rebels in Syria who are fighting against Assad, ISIS, and other Islamist forces. While the fighting is increasingly confused, especially in places like besieged Aleppo, the rebels being supplied by the CIA should not be confused with al Qaeda elements that go under the name of the Nusra Front. Obama's decision clearly means that Kerry's efforts at brokering a cease-fire are a cover for the U.S. to abandon Syria to the Russians, a move that will likely lead to more mass killings.\n\nWhat do Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton have to offer in response to this disgrace? Nothing.\n\nDespite his continual abuse of President Obama, Trump's policies seem closely aligned with those of the administration. Trump's advocacy for appeasing Russia would actually mean a continuation of current policies that hinge on the abandonment of U.S. responsibilities in the region. This is unaffected by his criticism of Iran (which contradicts his stand on Russia), lip service paid to support for Israel, and chest pounding about fighting ISIS.\n\nIn private, Clinton is reportedly again resurrecting her past support for a no-fly zone in Syria (which Obama rejected). But, in public, she is careful to allow no daylight between herself and Obama. Nor is it likely that a President Clinton would lead a liberal Democratic administration into the sort of use of force that might actually cause the Assad/Russian/Iranian coalition to stop killing people or allow a change of power in Damascus that is a prerequisite for defeating ISIS.\n\nBoth campaigns believe the American people don't care about Syria no matter how many die there or how piteous the pictures of its victims. Unfortunately, they appear to be right. To the extent that anyone is paying any attention to Syria it is to participate in a dishonest debate about refugees that pits unrealistic liberal altruism against a realistic, but myopic, fear of terror.\n\nLeadership and a sense of moral responsibility from the White House about Syria might have provided the only possible answer to such apathy and dishonesty. There is as little hope for that in January as there is now with Obama in office.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin 2016-09-05 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 5, 2016 14Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nIn a pre-Labor Day weekend news dump, the FBI released the notes (there was no recording) from its interview with Hillary Clinton. Democrats had to hope that the timing as well as the public's numbness to her email scandal would overwhelm any fallout over the details. But if Democrats want to understand why the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has tightened in the polls in the last weeks, they must come to grips with the fact that a lot of voters -- including many who aren't conservatives or inveterate Clinton-haters -- care more about the scandals than the party had realized.\n\nThe polls (both head-to-head matchups and four-way contests that include Gary Johnson and Jill Stein) show that by the end of August, Clinton's post-convention bounce had evaporated. But if Clinton is losing ground, the voters who are abandoning her aren't flocking to Trump. For the most part, Trump's numbers have remained stable. Those fleeing Clinton's camp are either embracing the two non-major party candidates or falling into the undecided category.\n\nThe Democrats' inability to maintain their momentum against Trump has to puzzle them. Though his campaign and its surrogates are claiming that the GOP candidate has finally begun the long-awaited pivot to the general election, even those weeks in which he has avoided a major blunder have been bumpy. Internal chaos, lack of a ground game to get out the vote, and near total dependence on a clearly unenthusiastic Republican National Committee are all signs of ongoing problems for Trump. Nor did his immigration speech last week do anything to ameliorate his problems with minority voters, Republican moderates, and independents.\n\nBut Trump is within reach of Clinton and has caught her in some national polls. Even if battleground-state surveys are still stacked against him and a path to 270 Electoral College votes seems unlikely, with two months to go until Election Day, Trump's chances can't be dismissed. This is because stories like the one the government tried to bury on Friday have convinced many voters that Clinton is, in her own way, as repugnant as Trump.\n\nThe FBI's notes raise a lot of questions. First, why wasn't Clinton questioned at the start of the inquiry rather than at its end when she could no longer be surprised by discoveries. And why was her State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills, who was presumably also was a subject of the inquiry, allowed to sit in?\n\nThe notes also indicate more problems with Clinton's claims. Are we really supposed to believe, for example, that she didn't understand any of the classification procedures used by the intelligence community or that she was never given any training on how to handle such information? Then there are the inconvenient details about the way she used her devices and destroyed information after news about the scandal broke in early 2015. And why was she using a private email to discuss drone strikes? Her assertion that she never emailed classified material was a flat out lie.\n\nIt's no accident that poll numbers consistently show that the public perceives her as untrustworthy. While Trump's unfavorable numbers are at historic highs, Clinton's are nearly as bad. If not for that, she would be running away with this election. If Democrats are baffled by a seemingly resurgent Trump, they need to start connecting the dots between Clinton's record of lies and her troubling poll numbers.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety.

Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nYesterday, in an exchange with reporters aboard his plane, Donald Trump offered up the latest in a series of baffling flip-flops on illegal immigration. When asked by a reporter whether he was ruling out a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants, Trump replied, \"I'm not ruling out anything.\" That was a reversal of the hard-line stand he took in his big immigration speech last week in Arizona, which was itself a reversal of statements made by the candidate and his campaign staff about \"softening\" the harsh positions he's been spouting since he began running for president.\n\nIf you find that confusing, you're not alone. Trump's surrogates are hard-pressed to keep pace with their man's statements and are reduced to disingenuously insisting that he's been consistent. But even amid the dishonest spin, one of them, Katrina Pierson, may have blurted out the truth this morning. She said on CNN that Trump's position wasn't a big deal because \"immigration is not showing to be a top priority for Americans in this election cycle.\" She's right about that, even if it contradicts everything Trump has said. And it's the only possible conclusion to draw from the results of the latest national poll that shows Trump gaining ground on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new CNN/ORC poll shows Trump edging ahead of Clinton by two points among likely voters. Coming from a poll that has consistently shown Clinton leading by significant margins, it should be taken seriously. Even more important are two other numbers that came out of the survey. For the first time, Clinton's unfavorable ratings exceeded those of Trump. The former secretary of state is disliked by 57 percent of Americans polled while Trump comes in at 56 percent. Both are historically high figures, but if you throw in the fact that CNN/ORC also finds that Trump is viewed as honest and trustworthy by 50 percent of Americans while only 35 percent would say the same about Clinton, then an election that seemed to be in the Democrats' pocket a few weeks ago might actually be up for grabs.\n\nThat a man who won't release his tax returns, has no principled beliefs, and has never had a position that couldn't be reversed can be viewed as honest and trustworthy boggles the mind. But in politics, as in much of life, such judgments rest primarily on the comparison with the alternative. Which is to say that after a year and a half of Democrats telling us that no one but the vast right-wing conspiracy cares about Clinton's scandals and the lies about them, their understanding of the voters' interests may be mistaken. Voters may not like Trump, nor can they count on him to do as he says. But they also care about the stench of corruption that emanates from the Clinton machine and all it touches.\n\nThe shift in polling doesn't necessarily doom Clinton. She is still leading in virtually every swing state and that edge is dragging down embattled Republican Congressional candidates to the point where the Democrats are now favored to take back control of the Senate. Her demographic edges among women, minorities, and young voters are still impressive. But it's also true that if enough Americans view her record with even more disgust than that of Trump, the turnout models that seemed to guarantee her victory in November may be flawed.\n\nClinton's decision to actually take questions from the reporters covering her campaign for the first time in several months may reflect a realization that her attempt to stonewall the press is counterproductive. This election is as much a referendum about her problems as it is about Trump's well-known flaws. Given Trump's lack of discipline, the focus may soon return to him and rescue the floundering Democrat. But in an election where both major candidates are disliked, nothing can be taken for granted.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 4Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nNew details have emerged in recent weeks about how three Americans were freed from Iranian prisons on January 17. That very day a cargo aircraft with pallets full of $400 million in cash landed in Tehran. The Obama administration denies any connection between these two events but common sense suggests that the delivery of the money -- even if it was ostensibly to pay old claims for Iranian arms sales dating back to 1979 -- was conditioned on the release of the hostages. Hence it was, in the common understanding, a ransom.\n\nBut even as those American hostages were being released, new ones were being seized. On January 15, three American contractors working for a subsidiary of General Dynamics to train Iraqi Special Forces were seized by Shiite gunmen in Baghdad and held for a month before being released. In a fascinating interview with Hannah Allam of McClatchey, the hostages for the first time tell their story, thus shedding a bit more light on what happened.\n\nThe three men were Waiel El-Maadawy, an Egyptian-American Army veteran and former Florida sheriff's deputy; his cousin and fellow Arabic speaker, Amr Mohamed; and Russell Frost, from Wichita, Kansas. The three men were seized from an interpreter's apartment -- and had to endure the indignity of having Iraqi officials claim they were actually in a bordello. Later they had to suffer a month of torture: \"The next three weeks brought round-the-clock horror: excruciating pain and utter darkness. They were kept blindfolded and shackled in stress positions, didn't get much food and learned to urinate in empty water bottles to avoid the beatings that accompanied bathroom visits, the men said. One captor patted El-Maadawy's muscular build and told him it was a shame that 'all that was about to be worm food.' \" The three men continue to struggle with the physical and psychological toll of their ordeal to this day.\n\nAnd who was responsible for inflicting this torture on them? According to McClatchey, \"The two Arabic-speaking Americans asked their captors whether they were part of the Iraqi government. They replied that the Iraqi government 'paid them to be in charge of this neighborhood,' El-Maadawy said.... 'They were supporting the Iraqi government, augmenting the Iraqi forces,' El-Maadawy said of his captors. 'In essence, we were kidnapped by the Iraqi government.' \"\n\nBut even though they were closely linked to the Iraqi government, the Sadrist gunmen also must have had close links to the Iranian government -- ties that go unmentioned in this article. The Popular Mobilization Forces, the Shiite militia group of which these kidnappers were a part, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Iranian Quds Force. It is doubtful that the kidnappers could have held three Americans for a month without at least a tacit okay from the Iranian government -- and probably would not have released them either without an okay from Tehran.\n\nBut we know nothing about why the men were held or why they were released. This story is told strictly from the hostages' point of view; they didn't know why the Shiite militiamen decided to hold them or to release them. Was a deal struck between Washington and Tehran or between Washington and Baghdad? It did not necessarily have to be a monetary deal -- there could have been a quid pro quo of some kind. We simply don't know. If Congress is going to probe the $400 million payment to Tehran, it should probe the contractors' kidnapping as well, along with the more recent seizure of further dual-national Iranians to replace the ones that have been released.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument.

The Chinese refused to let U.S. personnel roll out the standard stairway transported around the world for the presidential airplane. Then, when the president exited via a set of stairs in the belly of the aircraft, there was a scrum on the tarmac with Chinese personnel preventing National Security Adviser Susan Rice from reaching the presidential party. At one point a Chinese official loudly exclaimed to an American: \"This is our country, this is our airport.\" As noted in a news account:\n\nThe official's fury, caught on a cell phone and widely circulated, won glowing approval on one of China's most powerful government social media sites.\n\nOn Weibo, the equivalent of Twitter, the Public Security Bureau declared: \"This is our country.\"\n\n\"Yup, this is very China!\" the account, which has 24 million followers, noted as it showed a clip of Mr. Obama descending the small staircase. The comments on such sites appear only after passing censors.\n\nAt the same time that all of this was going on in Hangzhou, Chinese vessels have been swarming around Scarborough Shoal, a disputed rock formation in the South China Sea that China has claimed as its own territory, even though that claim has been soundly rejected by an international tribunal in the Hague.\n\nWhat links these two events? What accounts for these ill-tempered displays of Chinese nationalism?\n\nIt all goes back to the 19th century when China, which had long seen itself as the center of the civilized universe, experienced the shock and humiliation of being defeated by the British in the First Opium War (1839-1842). The result of China's military weakness was to allow many of the European powers, along with the United States and China, to establish extra-territorial privileges on its soil. Major Chinese cities such as Shanghai became virtual colonies under the occupation of various Western armies.\n\nNever mind that China greatly benefitted from this arrangement, at least in economic terms: Its industrialization and urbanization was kick-started by Western investment. Shanghai, for one, was a mere village before Westerners transformed it into one of the world's great cities. Nevertheless for Chinese patriots the subsidiary position their country had to accept in the world deeply rankled.\n\nPopular anger about China's humiliation helped propel the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and the republic that replaced the imperial regime. Mao Zedong and his Communists also utilized this sentiment in their drive to seize power from the Nationalist regime and the warlords who dominated China in the period between the two world wars. Mao painted Chiang Kai-shek and lesser warlords as mere lackeys of the Western and Japanese imperialists and capitalists and promised to restore Chinese greatness while also erasing distinctions between rich and poor and making everyone prosperous.\n\nFast forward to today-67 years after the revolution that brought the Communists to power. Mao's successors have made the country far richer than he could have imagined; GDP per capita has gone from $88 in 1960 to $7,924 in 2015, while total GDP has gone from $59 billion to $10.8 trillion. China is on the verge of surpassing the U.S. as the world's largest economy.\n\nYet even as China has become the go-to producer of electronics and lots of other goods, its No. 1 manufacturing industry has remained the same: It specializes in producing chips for shoulders. Specifically chips for the shoulders of Chinese people who are constantly reminded of the humiliation they have suffered in the past at the hands of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese. The Communist Party's not-so-subtle appeal is that only it can protect the Chinese from further humiliation in the future; only the Party can keep China together and make it as strong and respected and rich as it deserves to be.\n\nHence Chinese jubilation over a petty slight to the president of the United States and to a bigger and more significant slight to China's neighbors and the rule of law in the South China Sea. The Chinese anger and pride is real but it is also kept at a fever-pitch by Xi Jinping and the ruling Politburo. They know they need to keep stoking the flames of Chinese nationalism in order to provide a rationale for them and their families to enjoy complete control over 1.3 billion people-and the spoils that come with it.\n\nSo while \"stairgate\" is not very significant for its own sake, it is significant for what it says about China and its future-and what it says is pretty disturbing. China is a state with growing military and economic power, and yet its sense of being wronged by the world remains undiminished no matter how much success it enjoys. That is all too reminiscent of Kaiser Wilhelm II's Germany prior to 1914. History doesn't have to repeat itself; we are not doomed to fight a world war against China. But if we are to avoid such a conflict, it will require a hard-headed recognition of just how dangerous and volatile today's situation is, rather than succumbing to happy talk about Chinese-American cooperation on climate change and other matters.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact.

Tobin 2016-09-06 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 9Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nEvery once in a while one of the New York Times stumbles upon a great truth. That was the case with the piece featured on their front page on Monday, in which Mark Landler and Mark Mazzetti note that the abysmal failure of the Obama administration's Syria policy is being largely ignored by the American public and the two presidential candidates.\n\nThe article correctly states that Washington viewed the \"charnel house\" that is Syria as a \"distant disaster rather than an urgent crisis.\" More to the point, in spite of what the Obama cheering section at the Times acknowledges is an unmitigated disaster, the administration is facing no pressure to change course.\n\nObama's burden of guilt for the humanitarian disaster in Syria has been compounded by his decision to punt responsibility for the mess to Russia. Vladimir Putin, seeking to resurrect the old Soviet empire, is committed to keeping his client, the Assad regime, in power. Assad's forces (along with his Iranian, Hezbollah and Russian allies) are primarily responsible not only for the bulk of atrocities but for the Sunni population's support for ISIS and other radical groups that are perceived as their only defenders.\n\nObama refused to take action in the early days of the civil war and stuck to that stand even when Assad crossed Obama's \"red line\" and used chemical weapons. The president's inaction stemmed in part from a desire to appease both Russia and Iran. We now know that that the Russian agreement on Assad's chemical weapons was a farce and that he continues to use these illegal arms. As the bloodshed continues to take its toll, all Obama can do is to futilely advocate for a cease-fire that neither Assad nor the Russians want since the war has shifted in their favor.\n\nAs the Times aptly notes, there is no \"Plan B\" for the administration to fall back upon as Secretary of State John Kerry's pleas fall on deaf ears in Moscow, Damascus, and Tehran. Anonymous U.S. officials say that the president is not interested in expanding U.S. aid to those rebels in Syria who are fighting against Assad, ISIS, and other Islamist forces. While the fighting is increasingly confused, especially in places like besieged Aleppo, the rebels being supplied by the CIA should not be confused with al Qaeda elements that go under the name of the Nusra Front. Obama's decision clearly means that Kerry's efforts at brokering a cease-fire are a cover for the U.S. to abandon Syria to the Russians, a move that will likely lead to more mass killings.\n\nWhat do Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton have to offer in response to this disgrace? Nothing.\n\nDespite his continual abuse of President Obama, Trump's policies seem closely aligned with those of the administration. Trump's advocacy for appeasing Russia would actually mean a continuation of current policies that hinge on the abandonment of U.S. responsibilities in the region. This is unaffected by his criticism of Iran (which contradicts his stand on Russia), lip service paid to support for Israel, and chest pounding about fighting ISIS.\n\nIn private, Clinton is reportedly again resurrecting her past support for a no-fly zone in Syria (which Obama rejected). But, in public, she is careful to allow no daylight between herself and Obama. Nor is it likely that a President Clinton would lead a liberal Democratic administration into the sort of use of force that might actually cause the Assad/Russian/Iranian coalition to stop killing people or allow a change of power in Damascus that is a prerequisite for defeating ISIS.\n\nBoth campaigns believe the American people don't care about Syria no matter how many die there or how piteous the pictures of its victims. Unfortunately, they appear to be right. To the extent that anyone is paying any attention to Syria it is to participate in a dishonest debate about refugees that pits unrealistic liberal altruism against a realistic, but myopic, fear of terror.\n\nLeadership and a sense of moral responsibility from the White House about Syria might have provided the only possible answer to such apathy and dishonesty.

That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin 2016-09-05 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 5, 2016 14Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nIn a pre-Labor Day weekend news dump, the FBI released the notes (there was no recording) from its interview with Hillary Clinton. Democrats had to hope that the timing as well as the public's numbness to her email scandal would overwhelm any fallout over the details. But if Democrats want to understand why the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has tightened in the polls in the last weeks, they must come to grips with the fact that a lot of voters -- including many who aren't conservatives or inveterate Clinton-haters -- care more about the scandals than the party had realized.\n\nThe polls (both head-to-head matchups and four-way contests that include Gary Johnson and Jill Stein) show that by the end of August, Clinton's post-convention bounce had evaporated. But if Clinton is losing ground, the voters who are abandoning her aren't flocking to Trump. For the most part, Trump's numbers have remained stable. Those fleeing Clinton's camp are either embracing the two non-major party candidates or falling into the undecided category.\n\nThe Democrats' inability to maintain their momentum against Trump has to puzzle them. Though his campaign and its surrogates are claiming that the GOP candidate has finally begun the long-awaited pivot to the general election, even those weeks in which he has avoided a major blunder have been bumpy. Internal chaos, lack of a ground game to get out the vote, and near total dependence on a clearly unenthusiastic Republican National Committee are all signs of ongoing problems for Trump. Nor did his immigration speech last week do anything to ameliorate his problems with minority voters, Republican moderates, and independents.\n\nBut Trump is within reach of Clinton and has caught her in some national polls. Even if battleground-state surveys are still stacked against him and a path to 270 Electoral College votes seems unlikely, with two months to go until Election Day, Trump's chances can't be dismissed. This is because stories like the one the government tried to bury on Friday have convinced many voters that Clinton is, in her own way, as repugnant as Trump.\n\nThe FBI's notes raise a lot of questions. First, why wasn't Clinton questioned at the start of the inquiry rather than at its end when she could no longer be surprised by discoveries. And why was her State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills, who was presumably also was a subject of the inquiry, allowed to sit in?\n\nThe notes also indicate more problems with Clinton's claims. Are we really supposed to believe, for example, that she didn't understand any of the classification procedures used by the intelligence community or that she was never given any training on how to handle such information? Then there are the inconvenient details about the way she used her devices and destroyed information after news about the scandal broke in early 2015. And why was she using a private email to discuss drone strikes? Her assertion that she never emailed classified material was a flat out lie.\n\nIt's no accident that poll numbers consistently show that the public perceives her as untrustworthy. While Trump's unfavorable numbers are at historic highs, Clinton's are nearly as bad. If not for that, she would be running away with this election. If Democrats are baffled by a seemingly resurgent Trump, they need to start connecting the dots between Clinton's record of lies and her troubling poll numbers.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

A term that has its origins in the study of post-traumatic stress disorder is evidently now common currency for the eleven year old set.\n\nThe University of Chicago recently has won both praise and criticism for a letter it sent to first-year students informing them that, among other things, the college did not favor \"trigger warnings.\" In a university classroom, such warnings flag course content that students might find traumatic. At Oberlin College, for example, a resource guide advised professors \"Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is a triumph of literature that everyone in the world should read. However, it may trigger readers who have experienced racism, colonialism, religious persecution, violence, suicide, and more.\"\n\nIt's important to note that this guide was discarded because faculty at Oberlin vehemently opposed it. Oberlin is among the most left-leaning of all of our colleges and universities, so those who worry that such warnings are sweeping our universities and that professors have given up on challenging their students probably have less to worry about than they think.\n\nAt the same time, some critics of the University's stance are being disingenuous about trigger warnings. In what can only be described as a screed directed at the University of Chicago's position, Kevin Gannon of Grand View University asks: \"If I'm teaching historical material that describes war crimes like mass rape, shouldn't I disclose to my students what awaits them in these texts? If I have a student suffering from trauma due to a prior sexual assault, isn't a timely caution the empathetic and humane thing for me to do?\"\n\nBut, as my eleven year old could tell you, the idea of triggering is today detached from its roots in the psychology of post-traumatic stress disorder. Advocates of trigger warnings are not only or primarily sufferers from that condition or people who want to help them. Consider the students at Columbia who made an ultimately unsuccessful bid to include trigger warnings in Columbia's Core Curriculum. They were concerned with the broad question of \"transgressions concerning student identities\" and the \"impacts that the Western canon has had and continues to have on marginalized groups.\" The students, while in no way denying that the principles undergirding Western civilization have \"been liberating in many ways\" want instructors \"more consistently [to] acknowledge during class discussions that many of these same principles have created an unjust, unequal, and oppressive existence for many.\" I don't take these students to be villains or fanatics and there is no reason to think that discussions of the West should whitewash it, though it hardly seems likely that a curriculum that includes Rousseau, Marx, Fanon, Du Bois, and Foucault actually does so. But we should not pretend that the debate over trigger warnings is about whether or not we should show compassion or concern for victims of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAlso disingenuous, not to say disgraceful, is the attempt to dismiss critics of trigger warnings as right wingers, as Yale's Jim Sleeper has done in Sunday's New York Times. Sleeper goes after Greg Lukianoff and the Foundation of Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) as part of an irrational conservative backlash against universities. Sleeper's reasoning goes like this. Donald Trump has attacked political correctness. Greg Lukianoff has attacked political correctness. So Greg Lukianoff is Donald Trump. I'm joking only a little -- Sleeper says that Trump's \"rampages\" are \"just like\" FIRE's attacks on political correctness. Lukianoff who describes himself as a liberal, \"a former A.C.L.U. person who worked in refugee camps,\" is cast as a conservative, even though his organization defends left wing as well as right wing speech because, well, some conservatives like what he has to say. I suppose that means that President Obama, Michael Bloomberg, Wendy Kaminer, Jonathan Chait, the American Association of University Professors, and others once thought to be part of the middle or middle left are in fact part of a right-wing spin machine.\n\nThere is a debate on the left about trigger warnings, safe spaces and all the rest, but Sleeper's ritual invocation of \"conservatives\" tells us that academics need not listen to the arguments. If \"conservatives\" doesn't do the trick, Sleeper's mention of the \"Koch brothers\" (gasp!), from whom FIRE had the audacity to accept money, surely will. Sleeper and others who take his line insist that they are merely in favor of protecting robust debate within the academy from conservative outsiders who threaten it. But their attempt falsely to paint opponents of trigger warnings as conservative tools signals to the left-leaning academy that they need pay no attention to the arguments against trigger warnings.\n\nI suppose that's the point.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

                    "body": "Iran Was There Another Iran Ransom Deal? Max Boot 2016-09-06 Max Boot / Sept. 6, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nNew details have emerged in recent weeks about how three Americans were freed from Iranian prisons on January 17. That very day a cargo aircraft with pallets full of $400 million in cash landed in Tehran. The Obama administration denies any connection between these two events but common sense suggests that the delivery of the money -- even if it was ostensibly to pay old claims for Iranian arms sales dating back to 1979 -- was conditioned on the release of the hostages. Hence it was, in the common understanding, a ransom.\n\nBut even as those American hostages were being released, new ones were being seized. On January 15, three American contractors working for a subsidiary of General Dynamics to train Iraqi Special Forces were seized by Shiite gunmen in Baghdad and held for a month before being released. In a fascinating interview with Hannah Allam of McClatchey, the hostages for the first time tell their story, thus shedding a bit more light on what happened.\n\nThe three men were Waiel El-Maadawy, an Egyptian-American Army veteran and former Florida sheriff's deputy; his cousin and fellow Arabic speaker, Amr Mohamed; and Russell Frost, from Wichita, Kansas. The three men were seized from an interpreter's apartment -- and had to endure the indignity of having Iraqi officials claim they were actually in a bordello. Later they had to suffer a month of torture: \"The next three weeks brought round-the-clock horror: excruciating pain and utter darkness. They were kept blindfolded and shackled in stress positions, didn't get much food and learned to urinate in empty water bottles to avoid the beatings that accompanied bathroom visits, the men said. One captor patted El-Maadawy's muscular build and told him it was a shame that 'all that was about to be worm food.' \" The three men continue to struggle with the physical and psychological toll of their ordeal to this day.\n\nAnd who was responsible for inflicting this torture on them? According to McClatchey, \"The two Arabic-speaking Americans asked their captors whether they were part of the Iraqi government. They replied that the Iraqi government 'paid them to be in charge of this neighborhood,' El-Maadawy said.... 'They were supporting the Iraqi government, augmenting the Iraqi forces,' El-Maadawy said of his captors. 'In essence, we were kidnapped by the Iraqi government.' \"\n\nBut even though they were closely linked to the Iraqi government, the Sadrist gunmen also must have had close links to the Iranian government -- ties that go unmentioned in this article. The Popular Mobilization Forces, the Shiite militia group of which these kidnappers were a part, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Iranian Quds Force. It is doubtful that the kidnappers could have held three Americans for a month without at least a tacit okay from the Iranian government -- and probably would not have released them either without an okay from Tehran.\n\nBut we know nothing about why the men were held or why they were released. This story is told strictly from the hostages' point of view; they didn't know why the Shiite militiamen decided to hold them or to release them. Was a deal struck between Washington and Tehran or between Washington and Baghdad? It did not necessarily have to be a monetary deal -- there could have been a quid pro quo of some kind. We simply don't know. If Congress is going to probe the $400 million payment to Tehran, it should probe the contractors' kidnapping as well, along with the more recent seizure of further dual-national Iranians to replace the ones that have been released.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

The Chinese refused to let U.S. personnel roll out the standard stairway transported around the world for the presidential airplane. Then, when the president exited via a set of stairs in the belly of the aircraft, there was a scrum on the tarmac with Chinese personnel preventing National Security Adviser Susan Rice from reaching the presidential party. At one point a Chinese official loudly exclaimed to an American: \"This is our country, this is our airport.\" As noted in a news account:\n\nThe official's fury, caught on a cell phone and widely circulated, won glowing approval on one of China's most powerful government social media sites.\n\nOn Weibo, the equivalent of Twitter, the Public Security Bureau declared: \"This is our country.\"\n\n\"Yup, this is very China!\" the account, which has 24 million followers, noted as it showed a clip of Mr. Obama descending the small staircase. The comments on such sites appear only after passing censors.\n\nAt the same time that all of this was going on in Hangzhou, Chinese vessels have been swarming around Scarborough Shoal, a disputed rock formation in the South China Sea that China has claimed as its own territory, even though that claim has been soundly rejected by an international tribunal in the Hague.\n\nWhat links these two events? What accounts for these ill-tempered displays of Chinese nationalism?\n\nIt all goes back to the 19th century when China, which had long seen itself as the center of the civilized universe, experienced the shock and humiliation of being defeated by the British in the First Opium War (1839-1842). The result of China's military weakness was to allow many of the European powers, along with the United States and China, to establish extra-territorial privileges on its soil. Major Chinese cities such as Shanghai became virtual colonies under the occupation of various Western armies.\n\nNever mind that China greatly benefitted from this arrangement, at least in economic terms: Its industrialization and urbanization was kick-started by Western investment. Shanghai, for one, was a mere village before Westerners transformed it into one of the world's great cities. Nevertheless for Chinese patriots the subsidiary position their country had to accept in the world deeply rankled.\n\nPopular anger about China's humiliation helped propel the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and the republic that replaced the imperial regime. Mao Zedong and his Communists also utilized this sentiment in their drive to seize power from the Nationalist regime and the warlords who dominated China in the period between the two world wars. Mao painted Chiang Kai-shek and lesser warlords as mere lackeys of the Western and Japanese imperialists and capitalists and promised to restore Chinese greatness while also erasing distinctions between rich and poor and making everyone prosperous.\n\nFast forward to today-67 years after the revolution that brought the Communists to power. Mao's successors have made the country far richer than he could have imagined; GDP per capita has gone from $88 in 1960 to $7,924 in 2015, while total GDP has gone from $59 billion to $10.8 trillion. China is on the verge of surpassing the U.S. as the world's largest economy.\n\nYet even as China has become the go-to producer of electronics and lots of other goods, its No. 1 manufacturing industry has remained the same: It specializes in producing chips for shoulders. Specifically chips for the shoulders of Chinese people who are constantly reminded of the humiliation they have suffered in the past at the hands of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese. The Communist Party's not-so-subtle appeal is that only it can protect the Chinese from further humiliation in the future; only the Party can keep China together and make it as strong and respected and rich as it deserves to be.\n\nHence Chinese jubilation over a petty slight to the president of the United States and to a bigger and more significant slight to China's neighbors and the rule of law in the South China Sea. The Chinese anger and pride is real but it is also kept at a fever-pitch by Xi Jinping and the ruling Politburo. They know they need to keep stoking the flames of Chinese nationalism in order to provide a rationale for them and their families to enjoy complete control over 1.3 billion people-and the spoils that come with it.\n\nSo while \"stairgate\" is not very significant for its own sake, it is significant for what it says about China and its future-and what it says is pretty disturbing. China is a state with growing military and economic power, and yet its sense of being wronged by the world remains undiminished no matter how much success it enjoys. That is all too reminiscent of Kaiser Wilhelm II's Germany prior to 1914. History doesn't have to repeat itself; we are not doomed to fight a world war against China. But if we are to avoid such a conflict, it will require a hard-headed recognition of just how dangerous and volatile today's situation is, rather than succumbing to happy talk about Chinese-American cooperation on climate change and other matters.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin 2016-09-06 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 8Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nEvery once in a while one of the New York Times stumbles upon a great truth. That was the case with the piece featured on their front page on Monday, in which Mark Landler and Mark Mazzetti note that the abysmal failure of the Obama administration's Syria policy is being largely ignored by the American public and the two presidential candidates.\n\nThe article correctly states that Washington viewed the \"charnel house\" that is Syria as a \"distant disaster rather than an urgent crisis.\" More to the point, in spite of what the Obama cheering section at the Times acknowledges is an unmitigated disaster, the administration is facing no pressure to change course.\n\nObama's burden of guilt for the humanitarian disaster in Syria has been compounded by his decision to punt responsibility for the mess to Russia. Vladimir Putin, seeking to resurrect the old Soviet empire, is committed to keeping his client, the Assad regime, in power. Assad's forces (along with his Iranian, Hezbollah and Russian allies) are primarily responsible not only for the bulk of atrocities but for the Sunni population's support for ISIS and other radical groups that are perceived as their only defenders.\n\nObama refused to take action in the early days of the civil war and stuck to that stand even when Assad crossed Obama's \"red line\" and used chemical weapons. The president's inaction stemmed in part from a desire to appease both Russia and Iran. We now know that that the Russian agreement on Assad's chemical weapons was a farce and that he continues to use these illegal arms. As the bloodshed continues to take its toll, all Obama can do is to futilely advocate for a cease-fire that neither Assad nor the Russians want since the war has shifted in their favor.\n\nAs the Times aptly notes, there is no \"Plan B\" for the administration to fall back upon as Secretary of State John Kerry's pleas fall on deaf ears in Moscow, Damascus, and Tehran. Anonymous U.S. officials say that the president is not interested in expanding U.S. aid to those rebels in Syria who are fighting against Assad, ISIS, and other Islamist forces. While the fighting is increasingly confused, especially in places like besieged Aleppo, the rebels being supplied by the CIA should not be confused with al Qaeda elements that go under the name of the Nusra Front. Obama's decision clearly means that Kerry's efforts at brokering a cease-fire are a cover for the U.S. to abandon Syria to the Russians, a move that will likely lead to more mass killings.\n\nWhat do Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton have to offer in response to this disgrace? Nothing.\n\nDespite his continual abuse of President Obama, Trump's policies seem closely aligned with those of the administration. Trump's advocacy for appeasing Russia would actually mean a continuation of current policies that hinge on the abandonment of U.S. responsibilities in the region. This is unaffected by his criticism of Iran (which contradicts his stand on Russia), lip service paid to support for Israel, and chest pounding about fighting ISIS.\n\nIn private, Clinton is reportedly again resurrecting her past support for a no-fly zone in Syria (which Obama rejected). But, in public, she is careful to allow no daylight between herself and Obama. Nor is it likely that a President Clinton would lead a liberal Democratic administration into the sort of use of force that might actually cause the Assad/Russian/Iranian coalition to stop killing people or allow a change of power in Damascus that is a prerequisite for defeating ISIS.\n\nBoth campaigns believe the American people don't care about Syria no matter how many die there or how piteous the pictures of its victims. Unfortunately, they appear to be right. To the extent that anyone is paying any attention to Syria it is to participate in a dishonest debate about refugees that pits unrealistic liberal altruism against a realistic, but myopic, fear of terror.\n\nLeadership and a sense of moral responsibility from the White House about Syria might have provided the only possible answer to such apathy and dishonesty. There is as little hope for that in January as there is now with Obama in office.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period.

Tobin 2016-09-05 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 5, 2016 13Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nIn a pre-Labor Day weekend news dump, the FBI released the notes (there was no recording) from its interview with Hillary Clinton. Democrats had to hope that the timing as well as the public's numbness to her email scandal would overwhelm any fallout over the details. But if Democrats want to understand why the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has tightened in the polls in the last weeks, they must come to grips with the fact that a lot of voters -- including many who aren't conservatives or inveterate Clinton-haters -- care more about the scandals than the party had realized.\n\nThe polls (both head-to-head matchups and four-way contests that include Gary Johnson and Jill Stein) show that by the end of August, Clinton's post-convention bounce had evaporated. But if Clinton is losing ground, the voters who are abandoning her aren't flocking to Trump. For the most part, Trump's numbers have remained stable. Those fleeing Clinton's camp are either embracing the two non-major party candidates or falling into the undecided category.\n\nThe Democrats' inability to maintain their momentum against Trump has to puzzle them. Though his campaign and its surrogates are claiming that the GOP candidate has finally begun the long-awaited pivot to the general election, even those weeks in which he has avoided a major blunder have been bumpy. Internal chaos, lack of a ground game to get out the vote, and near total dependence on a clearly unenthusiastic Republican National Committee are all signs of ongoing problems for Trump. Nor did his immigration speech last week do anything to ameliorate his problems with minority voters, Republican moderates, and independents.\n\nBut Trump is within reach of Clinton and has caught her in some national polls. Even if battleground-state surveys are still stacked against him and a path to 270 Electoral College votes seems unlikely, with two months to go until Election Day, Trump's chances can't be dismissed. This is because stories like the one the government tried to bury on Friday have convinced many voters that Clinton is, in her own way, as repugnant as Trump.\n\nThe FBI's notes raise a lot of questions. First, why wasn't Clinton questioned at the start of the inquiry rather than at its end when she could no longer be surprised by discoveries. And why was her State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills, who was presumably also was a subject of the inquiry, allowed to sit in?\n\nThe notes also indicate more problems with Clinton's claims. Are we really supposed to believe, for example, that she didn't understand any of the classification procedures used by the intelligence community or that she was never given any training on how to handle such information? Then there are the inconvenient details about the way she used her devices and destroyed information after news about the scandal broke in early 2015. And why was she using a private email to discuss drone strikes? Her assertion that she never emailed classified material was a flat out lie.\n\nIt's no accident that poll numbers consistently show that the public perceives her as untrustworthy. While Trump's unfavorable numbers are at historic highs, Clinton's are nearly as bad. If not for that, she would be running away with this election. If Democrats are baffled by a seemingly resurgent Trump, they need to start connecting the dots between Clinton's record of lies and her troubling poll numbers.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

A term that has its origins in the study of post-traumatic stress disorder is evidently now common currency for the eleven year old set.\n\nThe University of Chicago recently has won both praise and criticism for a letter it sent to first-year students informing them that, among other things, the college did not favor \"trigger warnings.\" In a university classroom, such warnings flag course content that students might find traumatic. At Oberlin College, for example, a resource guide advised professors \"Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is a triumph of literature that everyone in the world should read. However, it may trigger readers who have experienced racism, colonialism, religious persecution, violence, suicide, and more.\"\n\nIt's important to note that this guide was discarded because faculty at Oberlin vehemently opposed it. Oberlin is among the most left-leaning of all of our colleges and universities, so those who worry that such warnings are sweeping our universities and that professors have given up on challenging their students probably have less to worry about than they think.\n\nAt the same time, some critics of the University's stance are being disingenuous about trigger warnings. In what can only be described as a screed directed at the University of Chicago's position, Kevin Gannon of Grand View University asks: \"If I'm teaching historical material that describes war crimes like mass rape, shouldn't I disclose to my students what awaits them in these texts? If I have a student suffering from trauma due to a prior sexual assault, isn't a timely caution the empathetic and humane thing for me to do?\"\n\nBut, as my eleven year old could tell you, the idea of triggering is today detached from its roots in the psychology of post-traumatic stress disorder. Advocates of trigger warnings are not only or primarily sufferers from that condition or people who want to help them. Consider the students at Columbia who made an ultimately unsuccessful bid to include trigger warnings in Columbia's Core Curriculum. They were concerned with the broad question of \"transgressions concerning student identities\" and the \"impacts that the Western canon has had and continues to have on marginalized groups.\" The students, while in no way denying that the principles undergirding Western civilization have \"been liberating in many ways\" want instructors \"more consistently [to] acknowledge during class discussions that many of these same principles have created an unjust, unequal, and oppressive existence for many.\" I don't take these students to be villains or fanatics and there is no reason to think that discussions of the West should whitewash it, though it hardly seems likely that a curriculum that includes Rousseau, Marx, Fanon, Du Bois, and Foucault actually does so. But we should not pretend that the debate over trigger warnings is about whether or not we should show compassion or concern for victims of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAlso disingenuous, not to say disgraceful, is the attempt to dismiss critics of trigger warnings as right wingers, as Yale's Jim Sleeper has done in Sunday's New York Times. Sleeper goes after Greg Lukianoff and the Foundation of Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) as part of an irrational conservative backlash against universities. Sleeper's reasoning goes like this. Donald Trump has attacked political correctness. Greg Lukianoff has attacked political correctness. So Greg Lukianoff is Donald Trump. I'm joking only a little -- Sleeper says that Trump's \"rampages\" are \"just like\" FIRE's attacks on political correctness. Lukianoff who describes himself as a liberal, \"a former A.C.L.U. person who worked in refugee camps,\" is cast as a conservative, even though his organization defends left wing as well as right wing speech because, well, some conservatives like what he has to say. I suppose that means that President Obama, Michael Bloomberg, Wendy Kaminer, Jonathan Chait, the American Association of University Professors, and others once thought to be part of the middle or middle left are in fact part of a right-wing spin machine.\n\nThere is a debate on the left about trigger warnings, safe spaces and all the rest, but Sleeper's ritual invocation of \"conservatives\" tells us that academics need not listen to the arguments. If \"conservatives\" doesn't do the trick, Sleeper's mention of the \"Koch brothers\" (gasp!), from whom FIRE had the audacity to accept money, surely will. Sleeper and others who take his line insist that they are merely in favor of protecting robust debate within the academy from conservative outsiders who threaten it. But their attempt falsely to paint opponents of trigger warnings as conservative tools signals to the left-leaning academy that they need pay no attention to the arguments against trigger warnings.\n\nI suppose that's the point.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous.

Remarkably, this view has persisted despite decades of proving wrong in ways that hurt the very countries which espouse it - as demonstrated yet again by newly released documents from the Nixon Administration.\n\nThe documents, which Amir Oren reported this week in Haaretz, include redacted versions of the CIA's daily presidential briefings on the eve of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The agency's cluelessness is mind-blowing.\n\nOn October 5, 1973, one day before the war began, the CIA acknowledged that \"The military exercises underway in Egypt seem to be on a larger scale and are being conducted more realistically than previous ones,\" but nevertheless insisted that \"they do not appear to be preparations for an offensive against Israel.\" The agency even dismissed an obvious danger sign as a reasonable response to fears of Israeli aggression: \"Cairo may have put its air defense and air forces on alert as a precaution against an Israeli reaction to the initial phase of the exercise.\"\n\nOn October 6, just hours before the war began, the CIA's briefing was similarly disconnected from reality:\n\nTension along Israel's borders with Egypt and Syria has been heightened by a Soviet airlift that is in its second day. Neither the Israelis nor the Arabs seem bent on starting hostilities, but in this atmosphere the risk of clashes is greater than usual. ... Both the Israelis and the Arabs are becoming increasingly concerned about their adversaries' military activities, but neither side seems bent on starting hostilities ... A military initiative at this time would make little sense for either Cairo or Damascus.\n\nOnce again, the agency seemed to view potential Israeli aggression as the main concern: \"Syria's cautious President [Hafez] Assad appears braced for a possible second blow from Israel rather than seeking revenge for his recent loss of 13 MIGs to Israeli fighters ... Nevertheless, the Syrians' fears could lead to a mobilization of their defenses, which in turn could alarm and galvanize the Israelis. Such a cycle of action and reaction would increase the risk of military clashes which neither side originally intended.\"\n\nAnd once again, it ignored clear danger signs, like the evacuation of Soviet dependents from Egypt and Syria. While admitting that this could be due to \"fear of an outbreak of hostilities,\" it optimistically suggested that instead, \"The Soviets might be using the excuse of rising tensions to reduce their presence without annoying the Egyptians.\"\n\nWhat actually happened on October 6 is history: Egypt and Syria launched a coordinated assault on Israel on the holiest day of the Jewish year, Yom Kippur. This had serious consequences for America, which I'll get to shortly. But first, consider the question of why the CIA was so oblivious to the danger signs.\n\nThis can't be attributed solely to its lack of good intelligence sources in Cairo and Damascus, though that lack is evident. First, as Oren noted, America had already received warning from someone with excellent sources in both capitals: King Hussein of Jordan. On September 25, Hussein took the extraordinary step of meeting with Israel's prime minister, despite the countries' lack of formal diplomatic ties, to warn that Syria and Egypt would soon attack. Israel relayed this to the White House, which informed the CIA.\n\nMoreover, though the CIA asserted on October 5 that \"the Israelis are not nervous\" about the Egyptian exercise, on October 6, it acknowledged that the Israelis were now very nervous; they no longer viewed Egypt's activity as \"normal\" and Syria's activity as \"defensive.\" Since Israel had fought three wars with Syria and Egypt in the past 25 years and monitored its neighbors' military activity very closely, the fact that Israel now deemed the Egyptian-Syrian activity unusual and worrying was an obvious danger sign, especially against the background of Hussein's warning. Yet the CIA dismissed it as unimportant, blithely reiterating that \"neither side\" wanted hostilities and that its main concern was any Israeli move which could provoke \"a cycle of action and reaction.\"\n\nThe only explanation that makes sense is the one that emerges clearly from the briefings' language: The CIA was so committed to its \"evenhanded\" approach, in which \"neither side\" wanted war, that it ignored all evidence to the contrary. Yet in reality, only one side wanted to avoid war. The other side, Syria and Egypt, was in fact \"bent on starting hostilities.\"\n\nThis ideological blindness ended up hurting not just Israel, but also America. Because the CIA insisted that neither side wanted war, and that the real danger was Israeli action, which could provoke a Syrian/Egyptian response, Washington exerted heavy pressure on Israel to refrain not just from launching a preemptive strike, but also even from a large-scale call-up of the reserves. This pressure might have been less effective had Israel's own intelligence agencies not also blundered, but it nevertheless contributed to the final result: Israel ended up absorbing a two-front attack from two much larger armies without adequate forces in place to meet it. Consequently, it suffered a rout during the first few days and had insufficient weaponry left to launch a counteroffensive.\n\nThis was the height of the Cold War, and an American client was already losing to Communist forces in Vietnam; Washington couldn't afford to have an American client lose to two Soviet clients in the Mideast as well. So Nixon ordered a massive airlift of arms, which enabled Israel to win a decisive victory.\n\nBut the airlift had two pernicious consequences. First, it inflamed tensions with America's European allies, since European countries categorically refused to let the U.S. planes land and refuel (Portugal eventually capitulated to American pressure and permitted refueling in the Azores Islands). More importantly, it inflamed the Arab world, which responded with an oil embargo that inflicted major damage on the U.S. economy.\n\nThe oil embargo probably wouldn't have happened had it not been for the airlift. The airlift might have been unnecessary had Washington not pressured Israel before the war to refrain from steps that could have helped it win quickly, like a preemptive strike or an earlier call-up of the reserves. And Washington might not have pressured Israel in this fashion had it actually understood that Syria and Egypt were \"bent on starting hostilities.\" But the CIA, stuck in its \"evenhanded\" mindset, provided policy makers with egregiously incorrect assessments. And America paid the price.\n\nForty-three years later, it seems the lessons still haven't been learned. The Palestinians and Hezbollah have replaced Cairo and Damascus as Israel's main Arab enemies (Iran is non-Arab), but the world still prates about the \"cycle of violence\" and insists that \"neither side\" wants war, no matter how many times the Arabs say otherwise. And Western countries are still suffering from their own cluelessness about the conflict's real nature.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:C.I.A.U.S.-Israel relationsYom Kippur War26Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",

The Chinese refused to let U.S. personnel roll out the standard stairway transported around the world for the presidential airplane. Then, when the president exited via a set of stairs in the belly of the aircraft, there was a scrum on the tarmac with Chinese personnel preventing National Security Adviser Susan Rice from reaching the presidential party. At one point a Chinese official loudly exclaimed to an American: \"This is our country, this is our airport.\" As noted in a news account:\n\nThe official's fury, caught on a cell phone and widely circulated, won glowing approval on one of China's most powerful government social media sites.\n\nOn Weibo, the equivalent of Twitter, the Public Security Bureau declared: \"This is our country.\"\n\n\"Yup, this is very China!\" the account, which has 24 million followers, noted as it showed a clip of Mr. Obama descending the small staircase. The comments on such sites appear only after passing censors.\n\nAt the same time that all of this was going on in Hangzhou, Chinese vessels have been swarming around Scarborough Shoal, a disputed rock formation in the South China Sea that China has claimed as its own territory, even though that claim has been soundly rejected by an international tribunal in the Hague.\n\nWhat links these two events? What accounts for these ill-tempered displays of Chinese nationalism?\n\nIt all goes back to the 19th century when China, which had long seen itself as the center of the civilized universe, experienced the shock and humiliation of being defeated by the British in the First Opium War (1839-1842). The result of China's military weakness was to allow many of the European powers, along with the United States and China, to establish extra-territorial privileges on its soil. Major Chinese cities such as Shanghai became virtual colonies under the occupation of various Western armies.\n\nNever mind that China greatly benefitted from this arrangement, at least in economic terms: Its industrialization and urbanization was kick-started by Western investment. Shanghai, for one, was a mere village before Westerners transformed it into one of the world's great cities. Nevertheless for Chinese patriots the subsidiary position their country had to accept in the world deeply rankled.\n\nPopular anger about China's humiliation helped propel the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and the republic that replaced the imperial regime. Mao Zedong and his Communists also utilized this sentiment in their drive to seize power from the Nationalist regime and the warlords who dominated China in the period between the two world wars. Mao painted Chiang Kai-shek and lesser warlords as mere lackeys of the Western and Japanese imperialists and capitalists and promised to restore Chinese greatness while also erasing distinctions between rich and poor and making everyone prosperous.\n\nFast forward to today-67 years after the revolution that brought the Communists to power. Mao's successors have made the country far richer than he could have imagined; GDP per capita has gone from $88 in 1960 to $7,924 in 2015, while total GDP has gone from $59 billion to $10.8 trillion. China is on the verge of surpassing the U.S. as the world's largest economy.\n\nYet even as China has become the go-to producer of electronics and lots of other goods, its No. 1 manufacturing industry has remained the same: It specializes in producing chips for shoulders. Specifically chips for the shoulders of Chinese people who are constantly reminded of the humiliation they have suffered in the past at the hands of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese. The Communist Party's not-so-subtle appeal is that only it can protect the Chinese from further humiliation in the future; only the Party can keep China together and make it as strong and respected and rich as it deserves to be.\n\nHence Chinese jubilation over a petty slight to the president of the United States and to a bigger and more significant slight to China's neighbors and the rule of law in the South China Sea. The Chinese anger and pride is real but it is also kept at a fever-pitch by Xi Jinping and the ruling Politburo. They know they need to keep stoking the flames of Chinese nationalism in order to provide a rationale for them and their families to enjoy complete control over 1.3 billion people-and the spoils that come with it.\n\nSo while \"stairgate\" is not very significant for its own sake, it is significant for what it says about China and its future-and what it says is pretty disturbing. China is a state with growing military and economic power, and yet its sense of being wronged by the world remains undiminished no matter how much success it enjoys. That is all too reminiscent of Kaiser Wilhelm II's Germany prior to 1914. History doesn't have to repeat itself; we are not doomed to fight a world war against China. But if we are to avoid such a conflict, it will require a hard-headed recognition of just how dangerous and volatile today's situation is, rather than succumbing to happy talk about Chinese-American cooperation on climate change and other matters.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin 2016-09-06 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 7Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nEvery once in a while one of the New York Times stumbles upon a great truth. That was the case with the piece featured on their front page on Monday, in which Mark Landler and Mark Mazzetti note that the abysmal failure of the Obama administration's Syria policy is being largely ignored by the American public and the two presidential candidates.\n\nThe article correctly states that Washington viewed the \"charnel house\" that is Syria as a \"distant disaster rather than an urgent crisis.\" More to the point, in spite of what the Obama cheering section at the Times acknowledges is an unmitigated disaster, the administration is facing no pressure to change course.\n\nObama's burden of guilt for the humanitarian disaster in Syria has been compounded by his decision to punt responsibility for the mess to Russia. Vladimir Putin, seeking to resurrect the old Soviet empire, is committed to keeping his client, the Assad regime, in power. Assad's forces (along with his Iranian, Hezbollah and Russian allies) are primarily responsible not only for the bulk of atrocities but for the Sunni population's support for ISIS and other radical groups that are perceived as their only defenders.\n\nObama refused to take action in the early days of the civil war and stuck to that stand even when Assad crossed Obama's \"red line\" and used chemical weapons. The president's inaction stemmed in part from a desire to appease both Russia and Iran. We now know that that the Russian agreement on Assad's chemical weapons was a farce and that he continues to use these illegal arms. As the bloodshed continues to take its toll, all Obama can do is to futilely advocate for a cease-fire that neither Assad nor the Russians want since the war has shifted in their favor.\n\nAs the Times aptly notes, there is no \"Plan B\" for the administration to fall back upon as Secretary of State John Kerry's pleas fall on deaf ears in Moscow, Damascus, and Tehran. Anonymous U.S. officials say that the president is not interested in expanding U.S. aid to those rebels in Syria who are fighting against Assad, ISIS, and other Islamist forces. While the fighting is increasingly confused, especially in places like besieged Aleppo, the rebels being supplied by the CIA should not be confused with al Qaeda elements that go under the name of the Nusra Front. Obama's decision clearly means that Kerry's efforts at brokering a cease-fire are a cover for the U.S. to abandon Syria to the Russians, a move that will likely lead to more mass killings.\n\nWhat do Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton have to offer in response to this disgrace? Nothing.\n\nDespite his continual abuse of President Obama, Trump's policies seem closely aligned with those of the administration. Trump's advocacy for appeasing Russia would actually mean a continuation of current policies that hinge on the abandonment of U.S. responsibilities in the region. This is unaffected by his criticism of Iran (which contradicts his stand on Russia), lip service paid to support for Israel, and chest pounding about fighting ISIS.\n\nIn private, Clinton is reportedly again resurrecting her past support for a no-fly zone in Syria (which Obama rejected). But, in public, she is careful to allow no daylight between herself and Obama. Nor is it likely that a President Clinton would lead a liberal Democratic administration into the sort of use of force that might actually cause the Assad/Russian/Iranian coalition to stop killing people or allow a change of power in Damascus that is a prerequisite for defeating ISIS.\n\nBoth campaigns believe the American people don't care about Syria no matter how many die there or how piteous the pictures of its victims. Unfortunately, they appear to be right. To the extent that anyone is paying any attention to Syria it is to participate in a dishonest debate about refugees that pits unrealistic liberal altruism against a realistic, but myopic, fear of terror.\n\nLeadership and a sense of moral responsibility from the White House about Syria might have provided the only possible answer to such apathy and dishonesty. There is as little hope for that in January as there is now with Obama in office.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

Tobin 2016-09-05 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 5, 2016 13Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nIn a pre-Labor Day weekend news dump, the FBI released the notes (there was no recording) from its interview with Hillary Clinton. Democrats had to hope that the timing as well as the public's numbness to her email scandal would overwhelm any fallout over the details. But if Democrats want to understand why the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has tightened in the polls in the last weeks, they must come to grips with the fact that a lot of voters -- including many who aren't conservatives or inveterate Clinton-haters -- care more about the scandals than the party had realized.\n\nThe polls (both head-to-head matchups and four-way contests that include Gary Johnson and Jill Stein) show that by the end of August, Clinton's post-convention bounce had evaporated. But if Clinton is losing ground, the voters who are abandoning her aren't flocking to Trump. For the most part, Trump's numbers have remained stable. Those fleeing Clinton's camp are either embracing the two non-major party candidates or falling into the undecided category.\n\nThe Democrats' inability to maintain their momentum against Trump has to puzzle them. Though his campaign and its surrogates are claiming that the GOP candidate has finally begun the long-awaited pivot to the general election, even those weeks in which he has avoided a major blunder have been bumpy. Internal chaos, lack of a ground game to get out the vote, and near total dependence on a clearly unenthusiastic Republican National Committee are all signs of ongoing problems for Trump. Nor did his immigration speech last week do anything to ameliorate his problems with minority voters, Republican moderates, and independents.\n\nBut Trump is within reach of Clinton and has caught her in some national polls. Even if battleground-state surveys are still stacked against him and a path to 270 Electoral College votes seems unlikely, with two months to go until Election Day, Trump's chances can't be dismissed. This is because stories like the one the government tried to bury on Friday have convinced many voters that Clinton is, in her own way, as repugnant as Trump.\n\nThe FBI's notes raise a lot of questions. First, why wasn't Clinton questioned at the start of the inquiry rather than at its end when she could no longer be surprised by discoveries. And why was her State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills, who was presumably also was a subject of the inquiry, allowed to sit in?\n\nThe notes also indicate more problems with Clinton's claims. Are we really supposed to believe, for example, that she didn't understand any of the classification procedures used by the intelligence community or that she was never given any training on how to handle such information? Then there are the inconvenient details about the way she used her devices and destroyed information after news about the scandal broke in early 2015. And why was she using a private email to discuss drone strikes? Her assertion that she never emailed classified material was a flat out lie.\n\nIt's no accident that poll numbers consistently show that the public perceives her as untrustworthy. While Trump's unfavorable numbers are at historic highs, Clinton's are nearly as bad. If not for that, she would be running away with this election. If Democrats are baffled by a seemingly resurgent Trump, they need to start connecting the dots between Clinton's record of lies and her troubling poll numbers.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers.

A term that has its origins in the study of post-traumatic stress disorder is evidently now common currency for the eleven year old set.\n\nThe University of Chicago recently has won both praise and criticism for a letter it sent to first-year students informing them that, among other things, the college did not favor \"trigger warnings.\" In a university classroom, such warnings flag course content that students might find traumatic. At Oberlin College, for example, a resource guide advised professors \"Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is a triumph of literature that everyone in the world should read. However, it may trigger readers who have experienced racism, colonialism, religious persecution, violence, suicide, and more.\"\n\nIt's important to note that this guide was discarded because faculty at Oberlin vehemently opposed it. Oberlin is among the most left-leaning of all of our colleges and universities, so those who worry that such warnings are sweeping our universities and that professors have given up on challenging their students probably have less to worry about than they think.\n\nAt the same time, some critics of the University's stance are being disingenuous about trigger warnings. In what can only be described as a screed directed at the University of Chicago's position, Kevin Gannon of Grand View University asks: \"If I'm teaching historical material that describes war crimes like mass rape, shouldn't I disclose to my students what awaits them in these texts? If I have a student suffering from trauma due to a prior sexual assault, isn't a timely caution the empathetic and humane thing for me to do?\"\n\nBut, as my eleven year old could tell you, the idea of triggering is today detached from its roots in the psychology of post-traumatic stress disorder. Advocates of trigger warnings are not only or primarily sufferers from that condition or people who want to help them. Consider the students at Columbia who made an ultimately unsuccessful bid to include trigger warnings in Columbia's Core Curriculum. They were concerned with the broad question of \"transgressions concerning student identities\" and the \"impacts that the Western canon has had and continues to have on marginalized groups.\" The students, while in no way denying that the principles undergirding Western civilization have \"been liberating in many ways\" want instructors \"more consistently [to] acknowledge during class discussions that many of these same principles have created an unjust, unequal, and oppressive existence for many.\" I don't take these students to be villains or fanatics and there is no reason to think that discussions of the West should whitewash it, though it hardly seems likely that a curriculum that includes Rousseau, Marx, Fanon, Du Bois, and Foucault actually does so. But we should not pretend that the debate over trigger warnings is about whether or not we should show compassion or concern for victims of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAlso disingenuous, not to say disgraceful, is the attempt to dismiss critics of trigger warnings as right wingers, as Yale's Jim Sleeper has done in Sunday's New York Times. Sleeper goes after Greg Lukianoff and the Foundation of Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) as part of an irrational conservative backlash against universities. Sleeper's reasoning goes like this. Donald Trump has attacked political correctness. Greg Lukianoff has attacked political correctness. So Greg Lukianoff is Donald Trump. I'm joking only a little -- Sleeper says that Trump's \"rampages\" are \"just like\" FIRE's attacks on political correctness. Lukianoff who describes himself as a liberal, \"a former A.C.L.U. person who worked in refugee camps,\" is cast as a conservative, even though his organization defends left wing as well as right wing speech because, well, some conservatives like what he has to say. I suppose that means that President Obama, Michael Bloomberg, Wendy Kaminer, Jonathan Chait, the American Association of University Professors, and others once thought to be part of the middle or middle left are in fact part of a right-wing spin machine.\n\nThere is a debate on the left about trigger warnings, safe spaces and all the rest, but Sleeper's ritual invocation of \"conservatives\" tells us that academics need not listen to the arguments. If \"conservatives\" doesn't do the trick, Sleeper's mention of the \"Koch brothers\" (gasp!), from whom FIRE had the audacity to accept money, surely will. Sleeper and others who take his line insist that they are merely in favor of protecting robust debate within the academy from conservative outsiders who threaten it. But their attempt falsely to paint opponents of trigger warnings as conservative tools signals to the left-leaning academy that they need pay no attention to the arguments against trigger warnings.\n\nI suppose that's the point.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle.

There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades.

That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see.

The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization.

Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period.

Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis.

No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable.

It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape.

Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Remarkably, this view has persisted despite decades of proving wrong in ways that hurt the very countries which espouse it - as demonstrated yet again by newly released documents from the Nixon Administration.\n\nThe documents, which Amir Oren reported this week in Haaretz, include redacted versions of the CIA's daily presidential briefings on the eve of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The agency's cluelessness is mind-blowing.\n\nOn October 5, 1973, one day before the war began, the CIA acknowledged that \"The military exercises underway in Egypt seem to be on a larger scale and are being conducted more realistically than previous ones,\" but nevertheless insisted that \"they do not appear to be preparations for an offensive against Israel.\" The agency even dismissed an obvious danger sign as a reasonable response to fears of Israeli aggression: \"Cairo may have put its air defense and air forces on alert as a precaution against an Israeli reaction to the initial phase of the exercise.\"\n\nOn October 6, just hours before the war began, the CIA's briefing was similarly disconnected from reality:\n\nTension along Israel's borders with Egypt and Syria has been heightened by a Soviet airlift that is in its second day. Neither the Israelis nor the Arabs seem bent on starting hostilities, but in this atmosphere the risk of clashes is greater than usual. ... Both the Israelis and the Arabs are becoming increasingly concerned about their adversaries' military activities, but neither side seems bent on starting hostilities ... A military initiative at this time would make little sense for either Cairo or Damascus.\n\nOnce again, the agency seemed to view potential Israeli aggression as the main concern: \"Syria's cautious President [Hafez] Assad appears braced for a possible second blow from Israel rather than seeking revenge for his recent loss of 13 MIGs to Israeli fighters ... Nevertheless, the Syrians' fears could lead to a mobilization of their defenses, which in turn could alarm and galvanize the Israelis. Such a cycle of action and reaction would increase the risk of military clashes which neither side originally intended.\"\n\nAnd once again, it ignored clear danger signs, like the evacuation of Soviet dependents from Egypt and Syria. While admitting that this could be due to \"fear of an outbreak of hostilities,\" it optimistically suggested that instead, \"The Soviets might be using the excuse of rising tensions to reduce their presence without annoying the Egyptians.\"\n\nWhat actually happened on October 6 is history: Egypt and Syria launched a coordinated assault on Israel on the holiest day of the Jewish year, Yom Kippur. This had serious consequences for America, which I'll get to shortly. But first, consider the question of why the CIA was so oblivious to the danger signs.\n\nThis can't be attributed solely to its lack of good intelligence sources in Cairo and Damascus, though that lack is evident. First, as Oren noted, America had already received warning from someone with excellent sources in both capitals: King Hussein of Jordan. On September 25, Hussein took the extraordinary step of meeting with Israel's prime minister, despite the countries' lack of formal diplomatic ties, to warn that Syria and Egypt would soon attack. Israel relayed this to the White House, which informed the CIA.\n\nMoreover, though the CIA asserted on October 5 that \"the Israelis are not nervous\" about the Egyptian exercise, on October 6, it acknowledged that the Israelis were now very nervous; they no longer viewed Egypt's activity as \"normal\" and Syria's activity as \"defensive.\" Since Israel had fought three wars with Syria and Egypt in the past 25 years and monitored its neighbors' military activity very closely, the fact that Israel now deemed the Egyptian-Syrian activity unusual and worrying was an obvious danger sign, especially against the background of Hussein's warning. Yet the CIA dismissed it as unimportant, blithely reiterating that \"neither side\" wanted hostilities and that its main concern was any Israeli move which could provoke \"a cycle of action and reaction.\"\n\nThe only explanation that makes sense is the one that emerges clearly from the briefings' language: The CIA was so committed to its \"evenhanded\" approach, in which \"neither side\" wanted war, that it ignored all evidence to the contrary. Yet in reality, only one side wanted to avoid war. The other side, Syria and Egypt, was in fact \"bent on starting hostilities.\"\n\nThis ideological blindness ended up hurting not just Israel, but also America. Because the CIA insisted that neither side wanted war, and that the real danger was Israeli action, which could provoke a Syrian/Egyptian response, Washington exerted heavy pressure on Israel to refrain not just from launching a preemptive strike, but also even from a large-scale call-up of the reserves. This pressure might have been less effective had Israel's own intelligence agencies not also blundered, but it nevertheless contributed to the final result: Israel ended up absorbing a two-front attack from two much larger armies without adequate forces in place to meet it. Consequently, it suffered a rout during the first few days and had insufficient weaponry left to launch a counteroffensive.\n\nThis was the height of the Cold War, and an American client was already losing to Communist forces in Vietnam; Washington couldn't afford to have an American client lose to two Soviet clients in the Mideast as well. So Nixon ordered a massive airlift of arms, which enabled Israel to win a decisive victory.\n\nBut the airlift had two pernicious consequences. First, it inflamed tensions with America's European allies, since European countries categorically refused to let the U.S. planes land and refuel (Portugal eventually capitulated to American pressure and permitted refueling in the Azores Islands). More importantly, it inflamed the Arab world, which responded with an oil embargo that inflicted major damage on the U.S. economy.\n\nThe oil embargo probably wouldn't have happened had it not been for the airlift. The airlift might have been unnecessary had Washington not pressured Israel before the war to refrain from steps that could have helped it win quickly, like a preemptive strike or an earlier call-up of the reserves. And Washington might not have pressured Israel in this fashion had it actually understood that Syria and Egypt were \"bent on starting hostilities.\" But the CIA, stuck in its \"evenhanded\" mindset, provided policy makers with egregiously incorrect assessments. And America paid the price.\n\nForty-three years later, it seems the lessons still haven't been learned. The Palestinians and Hezbollah have replaced Cairo and Damascus as Israel's main Arab enemies (Iran is non-Arab), but the world still prates about the \"cycle of violence\" and insists that \"neither side\" wants war, no matter how many times the Arabs say otherwise. And Western countries are still suffering from their own cluelessness about the conflict's real nature.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet.

Tobin / Sept. 2, 2016 13Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nIt turns out the public's connection to the most famous home-brew Internet and email server in history was greater than many of us thought. It wasn't just that Hillary Clinton used her insecure equipment to transmit State Department business and even highly classified information. We now know that the taxpayers paid for it. That's the upshot of a report in Politico that examined documents obtained from the General Services Administration (GSA) via the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAs the website notes, no laws were broken. But the newly obtained details make clear three important things. One is that the Clintons' decision to use their own server for all of their communications was no offhand mistake but a considered choice to establish a system that would help them to avoid transparency. The server was part of an organized plan of deception and the GSA was billed for both the equipment and personnel involved. The paper trail this left behind demonstrates the determination with which the Clintons and their staff created their own private communications world.\n\nThe second thing to note is the extent to which they deliberately blurred the lines between their personal affairs, the business of the Clinton Foundation, and the work of the State Department. Most of the Clintons' court of hangers-on and flunkies double- and triple-dipped salaries between the different entities. This isn't technically illegal but maybe that's in part due to the fact that it is unprecedented for former residents of the White House to be operating a massive three-pronged operation involving government service, philanthropy, and the activity associated with former presidents.\n\nThe ability of the Clintons to bilk the taxpayers in this manner opens a window into the the troubling conflicts of interest between the foundation and the State Department. We already knew large donors to the Clinton Foundation had an easy-pass entry into the office of the secretary of state, who put her top staffers at their beck and call. We also knew that some Clinton staffers were drawing salaries from both the Foundation and the State Department at various times. What we didn't know was that the GSA was also paying some of them for being part of the personal staff of a former president and his family. Records show that 13 of the 22 staffers being paid by the GSA were also getting salaries from the foundation. Teneo, a private consulting firm that did work for Foundation donors and other entities doing business for the State Department, was also paying some of the staffers. There was simply no way of telling where one entity ended and another began. Under such circumstances ethical problems are inevitable.\n\nLast, the Clinton's use of the GSA funds available to them under the Former Presidents Act shows how out of date this law has become. Passed in 1958, the law was motivated by the financial plight of Harry Truman after he left the White House. It was intended to ensure that former presidents without substantial resources could continue to live in dignity and function as public figures. It provided a pension, allowed for the costs of a small staff and an office, and provided health insurance and Secret Service protection.\n\nBut nearly 60 years later, circumstances have changed. Ex-presidents like Bill Clinton have used their former office as a springboard into wealth far beyond the dreams of a man like Truman. Bill and Hillary became millionaires on the strength of speaking fees and book advances and a foundation that served to further subsidize their lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-famous existence and aid their future political plans. The Clintons not only don't need the money they get from the GSA under the act, they have taken greater advantage of it than any other former First Family. But neither they nor the two Bushes or even Jimmy Carter need to keep bilking the taxpayers long after they leave the White House.\n\nThese days there's no better job in America than being an ex-president. After being in office, you not only don't revert to being private citizens in the manner that all presidents used to (Harry and Bess Truman actually took a road trip across the United States by themselves after he retired); you attain the status of permanent public figure, with all the perks of easily gotten wealth and celebrity. Each ex-president gets a museum and library for their papers that amounts to a modern-day version of an ancient pharaoh's pyramid. They don't need taxpayer subsidies anymore and, as the Clintons have proved, there is already far too much money flowing into the coffers of these people, creating unprecedented legal dilemmas. The Founding Fathers never intended former presidents and their wives (or husbands) to take on the role of dowager emperors and empresses. It's long past time these pampered celebrities shifted for themselves without further burdening the bloated federal budget.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason.

Tobin / Sept. 6, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nEvery once in a while one of the New York Times stumbles upon a great truth. That was the case with the piece featured on their front page on Monday, in which Mark Landler and Mark Mazzetti note that the abysmal failure of the Obama administration's Syria policy is being largely ignored by the American public and the two presidential candidates.\n\nThe article correctly states that Washington viewed the \"charnel house\" that is Syria as a \"distant disaster rather than an urgent crisis.\" More to the point, in spite of what the Obama cheering section at the Times acknowledges is an unmitigated disaster, the administration is facing no pressure to change course.\n\nObama's burden of guilt for the humanitarian disaster in Syria has been compounded by his decision to punt responsibility for the mess to Russia. Vladimir Putin, seeking to resurrect the old Soviet empire, is committed to keeping his client, the Assad regime, in power. Assad's forces (along with his Iranian, Hezbollah and Russian allies) are primarily responsible not only for the bulk of atrocities but for the Sunni population's support for ISIS and other radical groups that are perceived as their only defenders.\n\nObama refused to take action in the early days of the civil war and stuck to that stand even when Assad crossed Obama's \"red line\" and used chemical weapons. The president's inaction stemmed in part from a desire to appease both Russia and Iran. We now know that that the Russian agreement on Assad's chemical weapons was a farce and that he continues to use these illegal arms. As the bloodshed continues to take its toll, all Obama can do is to futilely advocate for a cease-fire that neither Assad nor the Russians want since the war has shifted in their favor.\n\nAs the Times aptly notes, there is no \"Plan B\" for the administration to fall back upon as Secretary of State John Kerry's pleas fall on deaf ears in Moscow, Damascus, and Tehran. Anonymous U.S. officials say that the president is not interested in expanding U.S. aid to those rebels in Syria who are fighting against Assad, ISIS, and other Islamist forces. While the fighting is increasingly confused, especially in places like besieged Aleppo, the rebels being supplied by the CIA should not be confused with al Qaeda elements that go under the name of the Nusra Front. Obama's decision clearly means that Kerry's efforts at brokering a cease-fire are a cover for the U.S. to abandon Syria to the Russians, a move that will likely lead to more mass killings.\n\nWhat do Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton have to offer in response to this disgrace? Nothing.\n\nDespite his continual abuse of President Obama, Trump's policies seem closely aligned with those of the administration. Trump's advocacy for appeasing Russia would actually mean a continuation of current policies that hinge on the abandonment of U.S. responsibilities in the region. This is unaffected by his criticism of Iran (which contradicts his stand on Russia), lip service paid to support for Israel, and chest pounding about fighting ISIS.\n\nIn private, Clinton is reportedly again resurrecting her past support for a no-fly zone in Syria (which Obama rejected). But, in public, she is careful to allow no daylight between herself and Obama. Nor is it likely that a President Clinton would lead a liberal Democratic administration into the sort of use of force that might actually cause the Assad/Russian/Iranian coalition to stop killing people or allow a change of power in Damascus that is a prerequisite for defeating ISIS.\n\nBoth campaigns believe the American people don't care about Syria no matter how many die there or how piteous the pictures of its victims. Unfortunately, they appear to be right. To the extent that anyone is paying any attention to Syria it is to participate in a dishonest debate about refugees that pits unrealistic liberal altruism against a realistic, but myopic, fear of terror.\n\nLeadership and a sense of moral responsibility from the White House about Syria might have provided the only possible answer to such apathy and dishonesty. There is as little hope for that in January as there is now with Obama in office.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter.

Tobin 2016-09-05 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 5, 2016 11Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nIn a pre-Labor Day weekend news dump, the FBI released the notes (there was no recording) from its interview with Hillary Clinton. Democrats had to hope that the timing as well as the public's numbness to her email scandal would overwhelm any fallout over the details. But if Democrats want to understand why the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has tightened in the polls in the last weeks, they must come to grips with the fact that a lot of voters -- including many who aren't conservatives or inveterate Clinton-haters -- care more about the scandals than the party had realized.\n\nThe polls (both head-to-head matchups and four-way contests that include Gary Johnson and Jill Stein) show that by the end of August, Clinton's post-convention bounce had evaporated. But if Clinton is losing ground, the voters who are abandoning her aren't flocking to Trump. For the most part, Trump's numbers have remained stable. Those fleeing Clinton's camp are either embracing the two non-major party candidates or falling into the undecided category.\n\nThe Democrats' inability to maintain their momentum against Trump has to puzzle them. Though his campaign and its surrogates are claiming that the GOP candidate has finally begun the long-awaited pivot to the general election, even those weeks in which he has avoided a major blunder have been bumpy. Internal chaos, lack of a ground game to get out the vote, and near total dependence on a clearly unenthusiastic Republican National Committee are all signs of ongoing problems for Trump. Nor did his immigration speech last week do anything to ameliorate his problems with minority voters, Republican moderates, and independents.\n\nBut Trump is within reach of Clinton and has caught her in some national polls. Even if battleground-state surveys are still stacked against him and a path to 270 Electoral College votes seems unlikely, with two months to go until Election Day, Trump's chances can't be dismissed. This is because stories like the one the government tried to bury on Friday have convinced many voters that Clinton is, in her own way, as repugnant as Trump.\n\nThe FBI's notes raise a lot of questions. First, why wasn't Clinton questioned at the start of the inquiry rather than at its end when she could no longer be surprised by discoveries. And why was her State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills, who was presumably also was a subject of the inquiry, allowed to sit in?\n\nThe notes also indicate more problems with Clinton's claims. Are we really supposed to believe, for example, that she didn't understand any of the classification procedures used by the intelligence community or that she was never given any training on how to handle such information? Then there are the inconvenient details about the way she used her devices and destroyed information after news about the scandal broke in early 2015. And why was she using a private email to discuss drone strikes? Her assertion that she never emailed classified material was a flat out lie.\n\nIt's no accident that poll numbers consistently show that the public perceives her as untrustworthy. While Trump's unfavorable numbers are at historic highs, Clinton's are nearly as bad. If not for that, she would be running away with this election. If Democrats are baffled by a seemingly resurgent Trump, they need to start connecting the dots between Clinton's record of lies and her troubling poll numbers.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

A term that has its origins in the study of post-traumatic stress disorder is evidently now common currency for the eleven year old set.\n\nThe University of Chicago recently has won both praise and criticism for a letter it sent to first-year students informing them that, among other things, the college did not favor \"trigger warnings.\" In a university classroom, such warnings flag course content that students might find traumatic. At Oberlin College, for example, a resource guide advised professors \"Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is a triumph of literature that everyone in the world should read. However, it may trigger readers who have experienced racism, colonialism, religious persecution, violence, suicide, and more.\"\n\nIt's important to note that this guide was discarded because faculty at Oberlin vehemently opposed it. Oberlin is among the most left-leaning of all of our colleges and universities, so those who worry that such warnings are sweeping our universities and that professors have given up on challenging their students probably have less to worry about than they think.\n\nAt the same time, some critics of the University's stance are being disingenuous about trigger warnings. In what can only be described as a screed directed at the University of Chicago's position, Kevin Gannon of Grand View University asks: \"If I'm teaching historical material that describes war crimes like mass rape, shouldn't I disclose to my students what awaits them in these texts? If I have a student suffering from trauma due to a prior sexual assault, isn't a timely caution the empathetic and humane thing for me to do?\"\n\nBut, as my eleven year old could tell you, the idea of triggering is today detached from its roots in the psychology of post-traumatic stress disorder. Advocates of trigger warnings are not only or primarily sufferers from that condition or people who want to help them. Consider the students at Columbia who made an ultimately unsuccessful bid to include trigger warnings in Columbia's Core Curriculum. They were concerned with the broad question of \"transgressions concerning student identities\" and the \"impacts that the Western canon has had and continues to have on marginalized groups.\" The students, while in no way denying that the principles undergirding Western civilization have \"been liberating in many ways\" want instructors \"more consistently [to] acknowledge during class discussions that many of these same principles have created an unjust, unequal, and oppressive existence for many.\" I don't take these students to be villains or fanatics and there is no reason to think that discussions of the West should whitewash it, though it hardly seems likely that a curriculum that includes Rousseau, Marx, Fanon, Du Bois, and Foucault actually does so. But we should not pretend that the debate over trigger warnings is about whether or not we should show compassion or concern for victims of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAlso disingenuous, not to say disgraceful, is the attempt to dismiss critics of trigger warnings as right wingers, as Yale's Jim Sleeper has done in Sunday's New York Times. Sleeper goes after Greg Lukianoff and the Foundation of Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) as part of an irrational conservative backlash against universities. Sleeper's reasoning goes like this. Donald Trump has attacked political correctness. Greg Lukianoff has attacked political correctness. So Greg Lukianoff is Donald Trump. I'm joking only a little -- Sleeper says that Trump's \"rampages\" are \"just like\" FIRE's attacks on political correctness. Lukianoff who describes himself as a liberal, \"a former A.C.L.U. person who worked in refugee camps,\" is cast as a conservative, even though his organization defends left wing as well as right wing speech because, well, some conservatives like what he has to say. I suppose that means that President Obama, Michael Bloomberg, Wendy Kaminer, Jonathan Chait, the American Association of University Professors, and others once thought to be part of the middle or middle left are in fact part of a right-wing spin machine.\n\nThere is a debate on the left about trigger warnings, safe spaces and all the rest, but Sleeper's ritual invocation of \"conservatives\" tells us that academics need not listen to the arguments. If \"conservatives\" doesn't do the trick, Sleeper's mention of the \"Koch brothers\" (gasp!), from whom FIRE had the audacity to accept money, surely will. Sleeper and others who take his line insist that they are merely in favor of protecting robust debate within the academy from conservative outsiders who threaten it. But their attempt falsely to paint opponents of trigger warnings as conservative tools signals to the left-leaning academy that they need pay no attention to the arguments against trigger warnings.\n\nI suppose that's the point.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape.

Remarkably, this view has persisted despite decades of proving wrong in ways that hurt the very countries which espouse it - as demonstrated yet again by newly released documents from the Nixon Administration.\n\nThe documents, which Amir Oren reported this week in Haaretz, include redacted versions of the CIA's daily presidential briefings on the eve of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The agency's cluelessness is mind-blowing.\n\nOn October 5, 1973, one day before the war began, the CIA acknowledged that \"The military exercises underway in Egypt seem to be on a larger scale and are being conducted more realistically than previous ones,\" but nevertheless insisted that \"they do not appear to be preparations for an offensive against Israel.\" The agency even dismissed an obvious danger sign as a reasonable response to fears of Israeli aggression: \"Cairo may have put its air defense and air forces on alert as a precaution against an Israeli reaction to the initial phase of the exercise.\"\n\nOn October 6, just hours before the war began, the CIA's briefing was similarly disconnected from reality:\n\nTension along Israel's borders with Egypt and Syria has been heightened by a Soviet airlift that is in its second day. Neither the Israelis nor the Arabs seem bent on starting hostilities, but in this atmosphere the risk of clashes is greater than usual. ... Both the Israelis and the Arabs are becoming increasingly concerned about their adversaries' military activities, but neither side seems bent on starting hostilities ... A military initiative at this time would make little sense for either Cairo or Damascus.\n\nOnce again, the agency seemed to view potential Israeli aggression as the main concern: \"Syria's cautious President [Hafez] Assad appears braced for a possible second blow from Israel rather than seeking revenge for his recent loss of 13 MIGs to Israeli fighters ... Nevertheless, the Syrians' fears could lead to a mobilization of their defenses, which in turn could alarm and galvanize the Israelis. Such a cycle of action and reaction would increase the risk of military clashes which neither side originally intended.\"\n\nAnd once again, it ignored clear danger signs, like the evacuation of Soviet dependents from Egypt and Syria. While admitting that this could be due to \"fear of an outbreak of hostilities,\" it optimistically suggested that instead, \"The Soviets might be using the excuse of rising tensions to reduce their presence without annoying the Egyptians.\"\n\nWhat actually happened on October 6 is history: Egypt and Syria launched a coordinated assault on Israel on the holiest day of the Jewish year, Yom Kippur. This had serious consequences for America, which I'll get to shortly. But first, consider the question of why the CIA was so oblivious to the danger signs.\n\nThis can't be attributed solely to its lack of good intelligence sources in Cairo and Damascus, though that lack is evident. First, as Oren noted, America had already received warning from someone with excellent sources in both capitals: King Hussein of Jordan. On September 25, Hussein took the extraordinary step of meeting with Israel's prime minister, despite the countries' lack of formal diplomatic ties, to warn that Syria and Egypt would soon attack. Israel relayed this to the White House, which informed the CIA.\n\nMoreover, though the CIA asserted on October 5 that \"the Israelis are not nervous\" about the Egyptian exercise, on October 6, it acknowledged that the Israelis were now very nervous; they no longer viewed Egypt's activity as \"normal\" and Syria's activity as \"defensive.\" Since Israel had fought three wars with Syria and Egypt in the past 25 years and monitored its neighbors' military activity very closely, the fact that Israel now deemed the Egyptian-Syrian activity unusual and worrying was an obvious danger sign, especially against the background of Hussein's warning. Yet the CIA dismissed it as unimportant, blithely reiterating that \"neither side\" wanted hostilities and that its main concern was any Israeli move which could provoke \"a cycle of action and reaction.\"\n\nThe only explanation that makes sense is the one that emerges clearly from the briefings' language: The CIA was so committed to its \"evenhanded\" approach, in which \"neither side\" wanted war, that it ignored all evidence to the contrary. Yet in reality, only one side wanted to avoid war. The other side, Syria and Egypt, was in fact \"bent on starting hostilities.\"\n\nThis ideological blindness ended up hurting not just Israel, but also America. Because the CIA insisted that neither side wanted war, and that the real danger was Israeli action, which could provoke a Syrian/Egyptian response, Washington exerted heavy pressure on Israel to refrain not just from launching a preemptive strike, but also even from a large-scale call-up of the reserves. This pressure might have been less effective had Israel's own intelligence agencies not also blundered, but it nevertheless contributed to the final result: Israel ended up absorbing a two-front attack from two much larger armies without adequate forces in place to meet it. Consequently, it suffered a rout during the first few days and had insufficient weaponry left to launch a counteroffensive.\n\nThis was the height of the Cold War, and an American client was already losing to Communist forces in Vietnam; Washington couldn't afford to have an American client lose to two Soviet clients in the Mideast as well. So Nixon ordered a massive airlift of arms, which enabled Israel to win a decisive victory.\n\nBut the airlift had two pernicious consequences. First, it inflamed tensions with America's European allies, since European countries categorically refused to let the U.S. planes land and refuel (Portugal eventually capitulated to American pressure and permitted refueling in the Azores Islands). More importantly, it inflamed the Arab world, which responded with an oil embargo that inflicted major damage on the U.S. economy.\n\nThe oil embargo probably wouldn't have happened had it not been for the airlift. The airlift might have been unnecessary had Washington not pressured Israel before the war to refrain from steps that could have helped it win quickly, like a preemptive strike or an earlier call-up of the reserves. And Washington might not have pressured Israel in this fashion had it actually understood that Syria and Egypt were \"bent on starting hostilities.\" But the CIA, stuck in its \"evenhanded\" mindset, provided policy makers with egregiously incorrect assessments. And America paid the price.\n\nForty-three years later, it seems the lessons still haven't been learned. The Palestinians and Hezbollah have replaced Cairo and Damascus as Israel's main Arab enemies (Iran is non-Arab), but the world still prates about the \"cycle of violence\" and insists that \"neither side\" wants war, no matter how many times the Arabs say otherwise. And Western countries are still suffering from their own cluelessness about the conflict's real nature.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

Tobin 2016-09-02 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 2, 2016 12Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nIt turns out the public's connection to the most famous home-brew Internet and email server in history was greater than many of us thought. It wasn't just that Hillary Clinton used her insecure equipment to transmit State Department business and even highly classified information. We now know that the taxpayers paid for it. That's the upshot of a report in Politico that examined documents obtained from the General Services Administration (GSA) via the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAs the website notes, no laws were broken. But the newly obtained details make clear three important things. One is that the Clintons' decision to use their own server for all of their communications was no offhand mistake but a considered choice to establish a system that would help them to avoid transparency. The server was part of an organized plan of deception and the GSA was billed for both the equipment and personnel involved. The paper trail this left behind demonstrates the determination with which the Clintons and their staff created their own private communications world.\n\nThe second thing to note is the extent to which they deliberately blurred the lines between their personal affairs, the business of the Clinton Foundation, and the work of the State Department. Most of the Clintons' court of hangers-on and flunkies double- and triple-dipped salaries between the different entities. This isn't technically illegal but maybe that's in part due to the fact that it is unprecedented for former residents of the White House to be operating a massive three-pronged operation involving government service, philanthropy, and the activity associated with former presidents.\n\nThe ability of the Clintons to bilk the taxpayers in this manner opens a window into the the troubling conflicts of interest between the foundation and the State Department. We already knew large donors to the Clinton Foundation had an easy-pass entry into the office of the secretary of state, who put her top staffers at their beck and call. We also knew that some Clinton staffers were drawing salaries from both the Foundation and the State Department at various times. What we didn't know was that the GSA was also paying some of them for being part of the personal staff of a former president and his family. Records show that 13 of the 22 staffers being paid by the GSA were also getting salaries from the foundation. Teneo, a private consulting firm that did work for Foundation donors and other entities doing business for the State Department, was also paying some of the staffers. There was simply no way of telling where one entity ended and another began. Under such circumstances ethical problems are inevitable.\n\nLast, the Clinton's use of the GSA funds available to them under the Former Presidents Act shows how out of date this law has become. Passed in 1958, the law was motivated by the financial plight of Harry Truman after he left the White House. It was intended to ensure that former presidents without substantial resources could continue to live in dignity and function as public figures. It provided a pension, allowed for the costs of a small staff and an office, and provided health insurance and Secret Service protection.\n\nBut nearly 60 years later, circumstances have changed. Ex-presidents like Bill Clinton have used their former office as a springboard into wealth far beyond the dreams of a man like Truman. Bill and Hillary became millionaires on the strength of speaking fees and book advances and a foundation that served to further subsidize their lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-famous existence and aid their future political plans. The Clintons not only don't need the money they get from the GSA under the act, they have taken greater advantage of it than any other former First Family. But neither they nor the two Bushes or even Jimmy Carter need to keep bilking the taxpayers long after they leave the White House.\n\nThese days there's no better job in America than being an ex-president. After being in office, you not only don't revert to being private citizens in the manner that all presidents used to (Harry and Bess Truman actually took a road trip across the United States by themselves after he retired); you attain the status of permanent public figure, with all the perks of easily gotten wealth and celebrity. Each ex-president gets a museum and library for their papers that amounts to a modern-day version of an ancient pharaoh's pyramid. They don't need taxpayer subsidies anymore and, as the Clintons have proved, there is already far too much money flowing into the coffers of these people, creating unprecedented legal dilemmas. The Founding Fathers never intended former presidents and their wives (or husbands) to take on the role of dowager emperors and empresses. It's long past time these pampered celebrities shifted for themselves without further burdening the bloated federal budget.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel.

Tobin 2016-09-01 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 1, 2016 66Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThis past January, as the Iran nuclear deal was implemented, the Obama administration justified its eagerness to end sanctions by asserting that Tehran had scrupulously kept all its promises. But it turns out that the demands placed on Iran weren't as strict as we were led to believe. The United States granted \"exemptions\" to the Islamist regime in order to more quickly end the international restrictions on doing business with it. These exemptions were revealed today in a Reuters story based on a report by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security. The institute's sources were highly placed Western officials with knowledge of the decision to give Iran a pass on several key points. These exemptions were kept secret from the public.\n\nThis is shocking for two reasons.\n\nToday's news stands in direct contrast to the consistent line taken by the administration about Iranian compliance. Even as Iran flouted United Nations restrictions on ballistic missile tests and continued to act as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, we were told by the administration not to be concerned since its terms were being observed. But we now know that the assurances about compliance were rooted in fiction. The exemptions granted to Iran mean that almost everything President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have said about the Iran deal since January was a lie. That's a breach of faith with the American public as well as with U.S. allies in the Middle East, like Israel and Saudi Arabia, that are in Iran's cross hairs. The exemptions also may have been kept secret from Congress. Senator Robert Menendez, a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters he had not been informed of the them in briefings.\n\nBut what's more, the details of these \"get out of jail free\" cards granted to Iran are in themselves appalling.\n\nAs Reuters reports, the exemptions included a provision that allowed Iran to exceed the agreed-upon amount of low-enriched uranium at its nuclear plants. That's important because such material can easily be converted to the highly enriched uranium that is used in nuclear weapons. Another exemption, regarding the removal of low-enriched uranium, calls into question whether either the commission supervising compliance or the International Atomic Energy Agency has any idea how much fuel Iran has kept or can convert. Yet another exemption involved letting Iran operate 19 so-called \"hot cell\" radiation containment chambers -- which the deal had prohibited. According to the institute, these chambers can be used for processing illegal plutonium fuel for nuclear weapons.\n\nThis report, along with Germany's revelations about Iran's illegally seeking to buy nuclear material, makes it clear that the degree of fraud in the supposedly airtight agreement to halt Iran's quest for a weapon is far greater than even many critics of the administration feared.\n\nThere's no way to undo the damage already done by the administration's policy of appeasing Iran. So much was sacrificed -- including Obama's 2012 campaign pledge to ensure the end of Iran's nuclear program -- in order to achieve the president's chief foreign-policy legacy. Iran was allowed a free hand in Syria and the deal was crafted to expire in 10 to 15 years. But now we know that even the provisions that were supposed to postpone Iran's getting a nuclear weapon were flouted with the full knowledge of the Western governments that signed the deal. The truth about the negotiations is being revealed and it's clear the president signed off on Iran's cheating. Congress, therefore, needs to fully investigate what else we don't know about an agreement that could wind up blowing up in the faces of the American people and our anxious allies.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:enriched uraniumIran nuclear deal66Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",

Tobin / Sept. 5, 2016 0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nIn a pre-Labor Day weekend news dump, the FBI released the notes (there was no recording) from its interview with Hillary Clinton. Democrats had to hope that the timing as well as the public's numbness to her email scandal would overwhelm any fallout over the details. But if Democrats want to understand why the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has tightened in the polls in the last weeks, they must come to grips with the fact that a lot of voters -- including many who aren't conservatives or inveterate Clinton-haters -- care more about the scandals than the party had realized.\n\nThe polls (both head-to-head matchups and four-way contests that include Gary Johnson and Jill Stein) show that by the end of August, Clinton's post-convention bounce had evaporated. But if Clinton is losing ground, the voters who are abandoning her aren't flocking to Trump. For the most part, Trump's numbers have remained stable. Those fleeing Clinton's camp are either embracing the two non-major party candidates or falling into the undecided category.\n\nThe Democrats' inability to maintain their momentum against Trump has to puzzle them. Though his campaign and its surrogates are claiming that the GOP candidate has finally begun the long-awaited pivot to the general election, even those weeks in which he has avoided a major blunder have been bumpy. Internal chaos, lack of a ground game to get out the vote, and near total dependence on a clearly unenthusiastic Republican National Committee are all signs of ongoing problems for Trump. Nor did his immigration speech last week do anything to ameliorate his problems with minority voters, Republican moderates, and independents.\n\nBut Trump is within reach of Clinton and has caught her in some national polls. Even if battleground-state surveys are still stacked against him and a path to 270 Electoral College votes seems unlikely, with two months to go until Election Day, Trump's chances can't be dismissed. This is because stories like the one the government tried to bury on Friday have convinced many voters that Clinton is, in her own way, as repugnant as Trump.\n\nThe FBI's notes raise a lot of questions. First, why wasn't Clinton questioned at the start of the inquiry rather than at its end when she could no longer be surprised by discoveries. And why was her State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills, who was presumably also was a subject of the inquiry, allowed to sit in?\n\nThe notes also indicate more problems with Clinton's claims. Are we really supposed to believe, for example, that she didn't understand any of the classification procedures used by the intelligence community or that she was never given any training on how to handle such information? Then there are the inconvenient details about the way she used her devices and destroyed information after news about the scandal broke in early 2015. And why was she using a private email to discuss drone strikes? Her assertion that she never emailed classified material was a flat out lie.\n\nIt's no accident that poll numbers consistently show that the public perceives her as untrustworthy. While Trump's unfavorable numbers are at historic highs, Clinton's are nearly as bad. If not for that, she would be running away with this election. If Democrats are baffled by a seemingly resurgent Trump, they need to start connecting the dots between Clinton's record of lies and her troubling poll numbers.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Herefiled under:Donald TrumpFBIHillary Clinton0Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:The FBI and Clinton's Poll NumbersMust-Reads from Magazine American Society No Defense for Trigger Warnings Jonathan Marks 2016-09-05 Jonathan Marks / Sept. 5, 2016 1Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nNot long ago, my eleven-year-old son jokingly asked me if I had been \"triggered\" by something his older brother had said. A term that has its origins in the study of post-traumatic stress disorder has is evidently now common currency for the eleven year old set.\n\nThe University of Chicago recently has won both praise and criticism for a letter it sent to first-year students informing them that, among other things, the college did not favor \"trigger warnings.\" In a university classroom, such warnings flag course content that students might find traumatic. At Oberlin College, for example, a resource guide advised professors \"Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is a triumph of literature that everyone in the world should read. However, it may trigger readers who have experienced racism, colonialism, religious persecution, violence, suicide, and more.\"\n\nIt's important to note that this guide was discarded because faculty at Oberlin vehemently opposed it. Oberlin is among the most left-leaning of all of our colleges and universities, so those who worry that such warnings are sweeping our universities and that professors have given up on challenging their students probably have less to worry about than they think.\n\nAt the same time, some critics of the University's stance are being disingenuous about trigger warnings. In what can only be described as a screed directed at the University of Chicago's position, Kevin Gannon of Grand View University asks: \"If I'm teaching historical material that describes war crimes like mass rape, shouldn't I disclose to my students what awaits them in these texts? If I have a student suffering from trauma due to a prior sexual assault, isn't a timely caution the empathetic and humane thing for me to do?\"\n\nBut, as my eleven year old could tell you, the idea of triggering is today detached from its roots in the psychology of post-traumatic stress disorder. Advocates of trigger warnings are not only or primarily sufferers from that condition or people who want to help them. Consider the students at Columbia who made an ultimately unsuccessful bid to include trigger warnings in Columbia's Core Curriculum. They were concerned with the broad question of \"transgressions concerning student identities\" and the \"impacts that the Western canon has had and continues to have on marginalized groups.\" The students, while in no way denying that the principles undergirding Western civilization have \"been liberating in many ways\" want instructors \"more consistently [to] acknowledge during class discussions that many of these same principles have created an unjust, unequal, and oppressive existence for many.\" I don't take these students to be villains or fanatics and there is no reason to think that discussions of the West should whitewash it, though it hardly seems likely that a curriculum that includes Rousseau, Marx, Fanon, Du Bois, and Foucault actually does so. But we should not pretend that the debate over trigger warnings is about whether or not we should show compassion or concern for victims of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAlso disingenuous, not to say disgraceful, is the attempt to dismiss critics of trigger warnings as right wingers, as Yale's Jim Sleeper has done in Sunday's New York Times. Sleeper goes after Greg Lukianoff and the Foundation of Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) as part of an irrational conservative backlash against universities. Sleeper's reasoning goes like this. Donald Trump has attacked political correctness. Greg Lukianoff has attacked political correctness. So Greg Lukianoff is Donald Trump. I'm joking only a little -- Sleeper says that Trump's \"rampages\" are \"just like\" FIRE's attacks on political correctness. Lukianoff who describes himself as a liberal, \"a former A.C.L.U. person who worked in refugee camps,\" is cast as a conservative, even though his organization defends left wing as well as right wing speech because, well, some conservatives like what he has to say. I suppose that means that President Obama, Michael Bloomberg, Wendy Kaminer, Jonathan Chait, the American Association of University Professors, and others once thought to be part of the middle or middle left are in fact part of a right-wing spin machine.\n\nThere is a debate on the left about trigger warnings, safe spaces and all the rest, but Sleeper's ritual invocation of \"conservatives\" tells us that academics need not listen to the arguments. If \"conservatives\" doesn't do the trick, Sleeper's mention of the \"Koch brothers\" (gasp!), from whom FIRE had the audacity to accept money, surely will. Sleeper and others who take his line insist that they are merely in favor of protecting robust debate within the academy from conservative outsiders who threaten it. But their attempt falsely to paint opponents of trigger warnings as conservative tools signals to the left-leaning academy that they need pay no attention to the arguments against trigger warnings.\n\nI suppose that's the point.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view.

Remarkably, this view has persisted despite decades of proving wrong in ways that hurt the very countries which espouse it - as demonstrated yet again by newly released documents from the Nixon Administration.\n\nThe documents, which Amir Oren reported this week in Haaretz, include redacted versions of the CIA's daily presidential briefings on the eve of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The agency's cluelessness is mind-blowing.\n\nOn October 5, 1973, one day before the war began, the CIA acknowledged that \"The military exercises underway in Egypt seem to be on a larger scale and are being conducted more realistically than previous ones,\" but nevertheless insisted that \"they do not appear to be preparations for an offensive against Israel.\" The agency even dismissed an obvious danger sign as a reasonable response to fears of Israeli aggression: \"Cairo may have put its air defense and air forces on alert as a precaution against an Israeli reaction to the initial phase of the exercise.\"\n\nOn October 6, just hours before the war began, the CIA's briefing was similarly disconnected from reality:\n\nTension along Israel's borders with Egypt and Syria has been heightened by a Soviet airlift that is in its second day. Neither the Israelis nor the Arabs seem bent on starting hostilities, but in this atmosphere the risk of clashes is greater than usual. ... Both the Israelis and the Arabs are becoming increasingly concerned about their adversaries' military activities, but neither side seems bent on starting hostilities ... A military initiative at this time would make little sense for either Cairo or Damascus.\n\nOnce again, the agency seemed to view potential Israeli aggression as the main concern: \"Syria's cautious President [Hafez] Assad appears braced for a possible second blow from Israel rather than seeking revenge for his recent loss of 13 MIGs to Israeli fighters ... Nevertheless, the Syrians' fears could lead to a mobilization of their defenses, which in turn could alarm and galvanize the Israelis. Such a cycle of action and reaction would increase the risk of military clashes which neither side originally intended.\"\n\nAnd once again, it ignored clear danger signs, like the evacuation of Soviet dependents from Egypt and Syria. While admitting that this could be due to \"fear of an outbreak of hostilities,\" it optimistically suggested that instead, \"The Soviets might be using the excuse of rising tensions to reduce their presence without annoying the Egyptians.\"\n\nWhat actually happened on October 6 is history: Egypt and Syria launched a coordinated assault on Israel on the holiest day of the Jewish year, Yom Kippur. This had serious consequences for America, which I'll get to shortly. But first, consider the question of why the CIA was so oblivious to the danger signs.\n\nThis can't be attributed solely to its lack of good intelligence sources in Cairo and Damascus, though that lack is evident. First, as Oren noted, America had already received warning from someone with excellent sources in both capitals: King Hussein of Jordan. On September 25, Hussein took the extraordinary step of meeting with Israel's prime minister, despite the countries' lack of formal diplomatic ties, to warn that Syria and Egypt would soon attack. Israel relayed this to the White House, which informed the CIA.\n\nMoreover, though the CIA asserted on October 5 that \"the Israelis are not nervous\" about the Egyptian exercise, on October 6, it acknowledged that the Israelis were now very nervous; they no longer viewed Egypt's activity as \"normal\" and Syria's activity as \"defensive.\" Since Israel had fought three wars with Syria and Egypt in the past 25 years and monitored its neighbors' military activity very closely, the fact that Israel now deemed the Egyptian-Syrian activity unusual and worrying was an obvious danger sign, especially against the background of Hussein's warning. Yet the CIA dismissed it as unimportant, blithely reiterating that \"neither side\" wanted hostilities and that its main concern was any Israeli move which could provoke \"a cycle of action and reaction.\"\n\nThe only explanation that makes sense is the one that emerges clearly from the briefings' language: The CIA was so committed to its \"evenhanded\" approach, in which \"neither side\" wanted war, that it ignored all evidence to the contrary. Yet in reality, only one side wanted to avoid war. The other side, Syria and Egypt, was in fact \"bent on starting hostilities.\"\n\nThis ideological blindness ended up hurting not just Israel, but also America. Because the CIA insisted that neither side wanted war, and that the real danger was Israeli action, which could provoke a Syrian/Egyptian response, Washington exerted heavy pressure on Israel to refrain not just from launching a preemptive strike, but also even from a large-scale call-up of the reserves. This pressure might have been less effective had Israel's own intelligence agencies not also blundered, but it nevertheless contributed to the final result: Israel ended up absorbing a two-front attack from two much larger armies without adequate forces in place to meet it. Consequently, it suffered a rout during the first few days and had insufficient weaponry left to launch a counteroffensive.\n\nThis was the height of the Cold War, and an American client was already losing to Communist forces in Vietnam; Washington couldn't afford to have an American client lose to two Soviet clients in the Mideast as well. So Nixon ordered a massive airlift of arms, which enabled Israel to win a decisive victory.\n\nBut the airlift had two pernicious consequences. First, it inflamed tensions with America's European allies, since European countries categorically refused to let the U.S. planes land and refuel (Portugal eventually capitulated to American pressure and permitted refueling in the Azores Islands). More importantly, it inflamed the Arab world, which responded with an oil embargo that inflicted major damage on the U.S. economy.\n\nThe oil embargo probably wouldn't have happened had it not been for the airlift. The airlift might have been unnecessary had Washington not pressured Israel before the war to refrain from steps that could have helped it win quickly, like a preemptive strike or an earlier call-up of the reserves. And Washington might not have pressured Israel in this fashion had it actually understood that Syria and Egypt were \"bent on starting hostilities.\" But the CIA, stuck in its \"evenhanded\" mindset, provided policy makers with egregiously incorrect assessments. And America paid the price.\n\nForty-three years later, it seems the lessons still haven't been learned. The Palestinians and Hezbollah have replaced Cairo and Damascus as Israel's main Arab enemies (Iran is non-Arab), but the world still prates about the \"cycle of violence\" and insists that \"neither side\" wants war, no matter how many times the Arabs say otherwise. And Western countries are still suffering from their own cluelessness about the conflict's real nature.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content.

Tobin / Sept. 2, 2016 12Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nIt turns out the public's connection to the most famous home-brew Internet and email server in history was greater than many of us thought. It wasn't just that Hillary Clinton used her insecure equipment to transmit State Department business and even highly classified information. We now know that the taxpayers paid for it. That's the upshot of a report in Politico that examined documents obtained from the General Services Administration (GSA) via the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAs the website notes, no laws were broken. But the newly obtained details make clear three important things. One is that the Clintons' decision to use their own server for all of their communications was no offhand mistake but a considered choice to establish a system that would help them to avoid transparency. The server was part of an organized plan of deception and the GSA was billed for both the equipment and personnel involved. The paper trail this left behind demonstrates the determination with which the Clintons and their staff created their own private communications world.\n\nThe second thing to note is the extent to which they deliberately blurred the lines between their personal affairs, the business of the Clinton Foundation, and the work of the State Department. Most of the Clintons' court of hangers-on and flunkies double- and triple-dipped salaries between the different entities. This isn't technically illegal but maybe that's in part due to the fact that it is unprecedented for former residents of the White House to be operating a massive three-pronged operation involving government service, philanthropy, and the activity associated with former presidents.\n\nThe ability of the Clintons to bilk the taxpayers in this manner opens a window into the the troubling conflicts of interest between the foundation and the State Department. We already knew large donors to the Clinton Foundation had an easy-pass entry into the office of the secretary of state, who put her top staffers at their beck and call. We also knew that some Clinton staffers were drawing salaries from both the Foundation and the State Department at various times. What we didn't know was that the GSA was also paying some of them for being part of the personal staff of a former president and his family. Records show that 13 of the 22 staffers being paid by the GSA were also getting salaries from the foundation. Teneo, a private consulting firm that did work for Foundation donors and other entities doing business for the State Department, was also paying some of the staffers. There was simply no way of telling where one entity ended and another began. Under such circumstances ethical problems are inevitable.\n\nLast, the Clinton's use of the GSA funds available to them under the Former Presidents Act shows how out of date this law has become. Passed in 1958, the law was motivated by the financial plight of Harry Truman after he left the White House. It was intended to ensure that former presidents without substantial resources could continue to live in dignity and function as public figures. It provided a pension, allowed for the costs of a small staff and an office, and provided health insurance and Secret Service protection.\n\nBut nearly 60 years later, circumstances have changed. Ex-presidents like Bill Clinton have used their former office as a springboard into wealth far beyond the dreams of a man like Truman. Bill and Hillary became millionaires on the strength of speaking fees and book advances and a foundation that served to further subsidize their lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-famous existence and aid their future political plans. The Clintons not only don't need the money they get from the GSA under the act, they have taken greater advantage of it than any other former First Family. But neither they nor the two Bushes or even Jimmy Carter need to keep bilking the taxpayers long after they leave the White House.\n\nThese days there's no better job in America than being an ex-president. After being in office, you not only don't revert to being private citizens in the manner that all presidents used to (Harry and Bess Truman actually took a road trip across the United States by themselves after he retired); you attain the status of permanent public figure, with all the perks of easily gotten wealth and celebrity. Each ex-president gets a museum and library for their papers that amounts to a modern-day version of an ancient pharaoh's pyramid. They don't need taxpayer subsidies anymore and, as the Clintons have proved, there is already far too much money flowing into the coffers of these people, creating unprecedented legal dilemmas. The Founding Fathers never intended former presidents and their wives (or husbands) to take on the role of dowager emperors and empresses. It's long past time these pampered celebrities shifted for themselves without further burdening the bloated federal budget.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company.

Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be.

Tobin 2016-09-01 Jonathan S. Tobin / Sept. 1, 2016 65Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print A\n\nThis past January, as the Iran nuclear deal was implemented, the Obama administration justified its eagerness to end sanctions by asserting that Tehran had scrupulously kept all its promises. But it turns out that the demands placed on Iran weren't as strict as we were led to believe. The United States granted \"exemptions\" to the Islamist regime in order to more quickly end the international restrictions on doing business with it. These exemptions were revealed today in a Reuters story based on a report by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security. The institute's sources were highly placed Western officials with knowledge of the decision to give Iran a pass on several key points. These exemptions were kept secret from the public.\n\nThis is shocking for two reasons.\n\nToday's news stands in direct contrast to the consistent line taken by the administration about Iranian compliance. Even as Iran flouted United Nations restrictions on ballistic missile tests and continued to act as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, we were told by the administration not to be concerned since its terms were being observed. But we now know that the assurances about compliance were rooted in fiction. The exemptions granted to Iran mean that almost everything President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have said about the Iran deal since January was a lie. That's a breach of faith with the American public as well as with U.S. allies in the Middle East, like Israel and Saudi Arabia, that are in Iran's cross hairs. The exemptions also may have been kept secret from Congress. Senator Robert Menendez, a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters he had not been informed of the them in briefings.\n\nBut what's more, the details of these \"get out of jail free\" cards granted to Iran are in themselves appalling.\n\nAs Reuters reports, the exemptions included a provision that allowed Iran to exceed the agreed-upon amount of low-enriched uranium at its nuclear plants. That's important because such material can easily be converted to the highly enriched uranium that is used in nuclear weapons. Another exemption, regarding the removal of low-enriched uranium, calls into question whether either the commission supervising compliance or the International Atomic Energy Agency has any idea how much fuel Iran has kept or can convert. Yet another exemption involved letting Iran operate 19 so-called \"hot cell\" radiation containment chambers -- which the deal had prohibited. According to the institute, these chambers can be used for processing illegal plutonium fuel for nuclear weapons.\n\nThis report, along with Germany's revelations about Iran's illegally seeking to buy nuclear material, makes it clear that the degree of fraud in the supposedly airtight agreement to halt Iran's quest for a weapon is far greater than even many critics of the administration feared.\n\nThere's no way to undo the damage already done by the administration's policy of appeasing Iran. So much was sacrificed -- including Obama's 2012 campaign pledge to ensure the end of Iran's nuclear program -- in order to achieve the president's chief foreign-policy legacy. Iran was allowed a free hand in Syria and the deal was crafted to expire in 10 to 15 years. But now we know that even the provisions that were supposed to postpone Iran's getting a nuclear weapon were flouted with the full knowledge of the Western governments that signed the deal. The truth about the negotiations is being revealed and it's clear the president signed off on Iran's cheating. Congress, therefore, needs to fully investigate what else we don't know about an agreement that could wind up blowing up in the faces of the American people and our anxious allies.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous.

Saadeddine Somaa, a former major in the Syrian Army, has identified in an interview with the New York Times the core issue in the Syrian Civil War-the greatest humanitarian and strategic catastrophe of our time. Syria has been torn apart by various factions intent on pursuing a power grab, and, despite John Kerry's ceaseless diplomacy, there is no sign of the fighting abating.\n\nIf anything, this war of all against all is only getting more ferocious and more absurd. Turkey recently launched an armed incursion into northern Syria that was billed as an offensive against Islamic State conducted with U.S. support. The reality, as the Wall Street Journal uncovered, is rather different: Ankara was still consulting with Washington over a possible incursion when it sent its troops charging into Syria, and their primary goal was not to defeat ISIS but rather to push back the Syrian Kurdish militia known as the YPG, which is aligned with the PKK rebels fighting within Turkey.\n\nTurkey views the emerging YPG-run state in northern Syria, known as Rojava, as a far greater threat to Turkish interests than ISIS is. Hence, the absurd spectacle of Turkey, a NATO ally with U.S. support, fighting against Kurdish fighters armed and also supported by the United States.\n\nMajor Somaa, who is aligned with the Free Syrian Army, was caught in the middle of this conflict. He and other Syrian Arab rebels are intent, with Turkish help, on evicting the Kurds from Manbij, the Syrian town recently seized by the YPG with U.S. air cover and other support.\n\nRather than straightening out this mess, the U.S. is only contributing to it, because, like everyone else, we are only pursuing our narrow self-interest-or what President Obama judges to be our self-interest-at the expense of the larger stakes in Syria. Obama believes that our only interest is in defeating ISIS, and never mind that there are other Islamist terror groups active in Syria, from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah to the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front (which has recently rebranded itself as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, the Front for the Liberation of the Levant). In the process, however, the U.S. has become caught in the sectarian struggle between the Kurds and the Turks, with the ridiculous results described above.\n\nIt is understandable that the U.S. would want to train and arm the YPG, which is one of the few secular fighting forces in Syria, but Obama has made a major miscalculation by becoming so reliant on a group with its own links to a terrorist organization, the PKK, that is understandably seen by Turkey as a deadly foe. It will be hard to end the Syrian Civil War without more support from Turkey, but the U.S. support for the Kurds has alienated the Turks.\n\nThe larger problem is that the U.S. has all but ceased to make any serious efforts to end the fighting and engineer a political solution, which is the only way to truly defeat not only ISIS but the other extremist groups. As long as violence continues, extremists of various stripes will find a safe haven in Syria. But to end the fighting would require the U.S. to do more to train and arm a non-sectarian fighting force-and support it with no-fly zones and other measures that have been anathema to the Obama administration. Instead of taking the hard but necessary steps to try to bring peace to Syria, the U.S. has been contributing to the chaos along with Iran, Turkey, Russia, Qatar, and other outside powers that are all backing \"their\" militia at the expense of the Syrian people.\n\nUnlock the rest of this article and all other COMMENTARY articles, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEnjoy every new issue -- either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.\n\nChoose the subscription that's right for you:\n\nAll Digital or Print + Digital\n\nTo read more, please subscribe or log in.\n\nJoin us -- you'll be in good company. Every author worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY:\n\n\" There's an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there's a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It's a journal I've read for nearly 30 years and I can't think of a time when I've valued it more. \"\n\nJonah Goldberg\n\n\" There is more commentary in the world than ever before -- whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective -- well, you're left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years -- for instance, it now publishes this blog -- but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. \"\n\nMax Boot\n\n\" Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. \"\n\nYuval Levin\n\n\" In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: \"The world's best magazine?\" Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts -- and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years -- the Obama administration home stretch -- and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. \"\n\nArthur Herman\n\n\" For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed -- exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad -- in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. \"\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\n\" COMMENTARY isn't just an important magazine. It's an indispensable one. It's been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It's indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it's indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it's ever been. \"\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\n\" COMMENTARY's writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. \"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson\n\n\" COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it's a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys -- the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell -- are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about \"Moon River\" that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts'n'culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I'm still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson's mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That's COMMENTARY for you -- provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as \"Moon River\" teaches us, there's such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can't know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. \"\n\nMark Steyn\n\n\" COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. \"\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\" In the midst of today's political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY's talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America's public dialogue and shape the nation's future. \"\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\" It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis -- and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. \"\n\nElliott Abrams\n\n\" For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country's intellectual health. \"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\n\n\" COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and -- of course -- Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. \"\n\nBret Stephens\n\n\" Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a \"frequent contributor\" who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. \"\n\nRuth R. Wisse\n\n\" Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. \"\n\nJoseph Epstein\n\n\" Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. \"\n\nMatthew Continetti\n\n\" COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. \"\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n\" Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment -- whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard -- has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. \"\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\n\" I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P's: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my \"idealistic\" '60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life's ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation's history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn't alone. \"\n\nMichael Medved\n\n\" Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. \"\n\nAndrew Roberts\n\n\" In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. \"\n\nDavid Frum\n\n\" COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there's anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America's place in the world and what it should be. I'm a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. \"\n\nDana Perino\n\nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast -- the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945.\n\nJoin the intellectual club, today.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nShop @ Amazon Here filed under:ISISSyriaTurkey8Shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Print Like us on Facebook to see more of our articles:",
