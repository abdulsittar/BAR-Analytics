                    "title": "Snow warning extended in Surrey and some could be 'cut off'",
                    "body": "A yellow weather warning for snow and ice issued by forecasters at the Met Office has been extended as cold weather is set to continue across the UK. This now coincides with a level three cold weather alert put in place by the government's UKHSA which lasts until midnight on Thursday (March 9).\n\nThe Met Office yellow warning now runs from midnight on Wednesday (March 8) through until 9am on Thursday (March 9). It comes as spells of snow on Wednesday are expected to cause disruption into Thursday morning. A 13-hour snow and ice alert was first issued in Surrey at 9pm on Monday (March 6).\n\nSnow had yet to fall in the county at the time of publication, with Surrey weather forecaster Ian Currie giving an explanation to SurreyLive as to why. He also made a new prediction for when snow could fall this week.\n\nResidents in the county and people travelling through have been warned of possible travel delays and the stranding of some vehicles and passengers. Public transport may also be cancelled as well as road closures. The Met Office has warned rural communities may become cut off and power cuts could occur.\n\nREAD MORE: All the roads in Surrey prioritised by gritters amid snow warning\n\nA spokesperson for the forecaster spoke of the need to extend the warning and said: \"Warning extended further north across a larger part of southern England and East Anglia, with the likelihood of impacts increased, and ice included as part of the warning. Warning has also been extended into Thursday, primarily to include residual ice impacts that may persist into the morning travel period.\"\n\nThe yellow warning was issued this week due to an area of rain, sleet, and snow that is expected to develop over southwest England on Tuesday (March 7) and which will move east overnight and into Wednesday (March 8). It is thought this will begin to clear mid-morning but further sleet and snow are again likely in the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe snow is expected to clear on Wednesday night but clear skies will result in ice on untreated surfaces. This will then linger into Thursday morning (March 9) and continue to impact travel.\n\nGet more news from SurreyLive straight to your inbox for free HERE.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nM25 and A3 closures drivers will want to avoid this week All the roads in Surrey prioritised by gritters amid snow warning Plan to expand Surrey Hills by a quarter gains momentum as consultation launches Surrey under 13 hour snow warning with some people told to stock up on food Garden video captures rare albino squirrel Snowy pinching some nuts",

                    "body": "Snow is expected to fall on Cornwall overnight as temperatures plunge, says the Met Office. The needle will fall close to freezing on higher ground, with a \"feels like\" temperature of -3C.\n\nTomorrow (March 8) and Thursday will see the county, as well as other areas of the Westcountry, plunge into a yellow Met Office weather warning for snow and ice.\n\nMost of it looks set to fall on the higher areas of the south west. For Cornwall those living close to the River Tamar are more likely to wake up to signs that Jack Frost has visited and across the border in Devon, Dartmoor and Exmoor and their native towns and villages will likely experience the brunt of the weather.\n\nREAD MORE: Northern Lights dazzle Cornwall sky with stunning display\n\nThe chances of snow are less likely for those living south west of Bodmin but weather conditions may still be treacherous, and there could be some disruption for those planning on travelling by train or car out of the county. Snow is expected to fall in areas of Devon, Somerset, and Dorset.\n\nBelow are the main where snow has been predicted to fall for tomorrow in Cornwall:\n\nBodmin\n\nThe Met Office has forecasted Bodmin to receive a small amount of sleet between 2am and 3am, which then turns to light rain by 4am.\n\nClouds and spatterings of rain will fall through the morning until 11am, which then sees light rain turn heavy to last throughout the afternoon and into the early evening.\n\nCamelford\n\nCamelford has been predicted sleet for 1am, which turns briefly to heavy snow at 2am. After this, the Met Office says light snow will fall from around 3am until 7am, so those in the area may well open their curtains to a snowy winter's day.\n\nAnother burst of light snow has been predicted to fall at around 10am, but with rain and 3C-4C weather predicted for the afternoon it's not likely that the snow will last.\n\nLiskeard\n\nThe town of Liskeard is predicted to have sleet starting at around 2am tomorrow morning which will last for approximately 2 hours. Then, from 5am until 7am, light snow has been predicted for the area with an accompanying temperature of a brisk 2C, which means those heading out early in their cars may experience some snowfall.\n\nAs such, extra precautions are advised to avoid accidents on the roads. The rest of the morning sees rain which gradually gets heavier throughout the day.\n\nSouth West region weather forecast for the week ahead Today:\n\nCloudy on Tuesday with outbreaks of rain and sleet, perhaps some snow, especially over hills. This gradually moves its way southwards, turning patchier and lighter though staying rather cloudy. Feeling cold. Maximum temperature 7 \u00b0C.\n\nTonight:\n\nOutbreaks of rain, sleet and snow likely to spread northeastwards overnight, with some lying snow likely by dawn, especially over higher ground. Cold with the risk of icy patches. Minimum temperature -1 \u00b0C.\n\nWednesday:\n\nMostly cloudy with further outbreaks of mainly light rain, sleet, or snow during the morning. Briefly turning drier before rain or snow returns later with strengthening winds. Maximum temperature 6 \u00b0C.\n\nOutlook for Thursday to Saturday:\n\nTurning milder later in the week though staying unsettled with further rain at times and often rather windy, with some strong winds on Friday. A slight improvement on Saturday.\n\nRead next:\n\n53 photos showing Cornwall looking magical covered in snow\n\nIncredible Cornwall dunes procession in pictures\n\nWe rode monster trucks among the white pyramids and clay pits\n\nA30 closure as roundabout is permanently removed\n\nFern Britton's favourite places to eat and walk in Cornwall",

                    "body": "An urgent weather warning for snow covering the South West has been extended by a further nine hours. The Exeter-based Met Office initially issued the alert yesterday (March 6) with most of the region and parts of southern England and Wales covered on Wednesday (March 8).\n\nThe warning was just for snow and was put in place for a 24-hour period starting at midnight. However, following an update to forecasts, the Met Office has now made changes to the warning, which now includes ice.\n\nOther alterations include the area covered by the warning being extended across more of southern England all the way to East Anglia. The timings have also been changed with the warning set to remain in place until 9am on Thursday (March 9).\n\nRead more:Kirstie Allsopp slams Prince Harry's 'privileged' drugs confession\n\nIn its update, the Met Office said: \"Warning extended further north across a larger part of southern England and East Anglia, with the likelihood of impacts increased, and ice included as part of the warning. Warning has also been extended into Thursday, primarily to include residual ice impacts that may persist into the morning travel period.\"\n\nThe warning itself states: \"Spells of snow on Wednesday may cause travel disruption during Wednesday into Thursday morning.\"\n\nMet Office forecasters have said the following can be expected during the warning period:\n\nPossible travel delays on roads stranding some vehicles and passengers. Bus and train services may be delayed or cancelled, with some road closures and longer journey times possible. Some rural communities could become temporarily cut off. Power cuts may occur and other services may be temporarily affected. Untreated pavements and cycle paths might be impassable with a chance of injuries from slips and falls on snow-covered or icy surfaces. Met Office five-day weather forecast for the South West Today\n\nCloudy on Tuesday with outbreaks of rain and sleet, perhaps some snow, especially over hills. This gradually moves its way southwards, turning patchier and lighter though staying rather cloudy. Feeling cold. Maximum temperature 7 \u00b0C.\n\nTonight\n\nOutbreaks of rain, sleet and snow likely to spread northeastwards overnight, with some lying snow likely by dawn, especially over higher ground. Cold with the risk of icy patches. Minimum temperature -1 \u00b0C.\n\nTomorrow\n\nMostly cloudy with further outbreaks of mainly light rain, sleet, or snow during the morning. Briefly turning drier before rain or snow returns later with strengthening winds. Maximum temperature 6 \u00b0C.\n\nOutlook for Thursday to Saturday\n\nTurning milder later in the week though staying unsettled with further rain at times and often rather windy, with some strong winds on Friday. A slight improvement on Saturday.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nTown in shock after schoolgirl's death\n\nFamily's terror at McDonald's as 'kids launch bricks through windows'\n\nVanessa George paedo ringleader could be days away from freedom\n\n'Panther' caught on camera in field\n\nKate Middleton hopes to take three children on holiday to UK island she misses",

                    "body": "A weather forecaster said those disappointed by the lack of snow in Surrey on Tuesday (March 7) should keep their eyes peeled. Surrey was issued with a 13-hour snow warning by the Met Office and many were hoping to wake up to see it as predicted. Instead, despite remaining very cold, the white stuff has not fallen just yet.\n\nBut Ian Currie, a broadcaster and a member of the Royal Meteorological Society, said people should not lose hope yet. Although he had received reports of snow in some higher areas of the county, he said it was most likely to fall across the rest of Surrey on Wednesday (March 8).\n\n\"The weather system affecting us at the moment is going to return with renewed bursts of precipitation,\" Mr Currie said. \"I think that it could provide snow and sleet more generally in Surrey and Sussex tomorrow.\n\nREAD MORE:Surrey under 13 hour snow warning with some people told to stock up on food\n\n\"There's very mild air to the south but very cold air to the north and tomorrow we'll be at the boundary of that which will give the precipitation and perhaps 2cm to 3cm of snow. It's going to be quite changeable.\n\n\"March can have more snow and sleet than the winter. The Arctic is at its coldest and when you do get cold air bursting out it can produce snow. There have been many examples of snowstorms in March, on this date in 1891 a person was buried in a 15-foot snowdrift near Dorking and died.\"\n\nMr Currie, who correctly predicted the famous October 1987 storm, also had his say on the Met Office weather warnings with some saying they fail to predict the snow or extreme weather as promised. He said weather systems were tricky to predict but the alert had correctly guessed snow would fall in other areas such as Oxfordshire and Suffolk.\n\nHe added: \"What they're saying is the potential and this potential is a developing situation. What they're really saying is, 'keep abreast of the forecast, there is a potential situation now for snow and cold weather'.\n\n\"Snow is very fickle, [it's hard to say] precisely where it will occur. At least people are aware and they're not caught out, if they said nothing and there's heavy snow people would be saying 'nobody told us'.\"\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nAll the roads in Surrey prioritised by gritters amid snow warning\n\nMet Office verdict on snow tomorrow with it forecast to fall for six hours\n\nMet Office, BBC Weather and other forecasters agree when snow will fall next week\n\nPlan to expand Surrey Hills by a quarter gains momentum as consultation launches\n\nM25 and A3 closures drivers will want to avoid this week",

The West Midlands is in the grip of a snow and ice warning on Tuesday March 7.\n\nThere are weather warnings acrosss four days this week - from Tuesday to Friday March 10. In its warning, forecasters say: \"Frequent snow showers will continue, causing further disruption in places.\"\n\nA snow and ice warning affected Scotland and north east England will last until 10am tomorrow. As well as that warning, which lasts til Wednesday, another alert will take hold in the south west of England.\n\nREAD MORE Met Office shares exact date -10C snow blast ends and UK finally warms up\n\n\"Spells of snow on Wednesday may cause travel disruption during Wednesday into Thursday morning,\" the Met Office advises. Possible travel delays on roads stranding some vehicles and passengers.\n\nBus and train services may be delayed or cancelled, with some road closures and longer journey times possible. Some rural communities could become temporarily cut off. Power cuts may occur and other services may be temporarily affected.\n\nUntreated pavements and cycle paths might be impassable with a chance of injuries from slips and falls on snow-covered or icy surfaces. Into Thursday and the snow and ice warning in the north turns into a pure snow warning.\n\nIt lasts from 3am Thursday to 6pm on Friday. Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK. Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\nEvent totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.",

                    "body": "A 33-hour weather warning has been implemented by the Met Office\n\nA new Met Office weather map shows when snow is most likely to hit Berkshire. Despite spring being not too far away, another spell of cold weather could bring snow and sleet to large parts of the UK.\n\nThe Met Office has issued various weather warnings, most of those warning of snow and ice, in recent days. A recently issued warning for snow and ice has been expanded to cover all of Berkshire and will come into force at midnight tonight (March 8).\n\nThe warning will remain in effect until 9am on Thursday morning (March 9) and will bring some disruption. Whilst the warning is in place for 33 hours, much of the snowfall is due to arrive over a short period on Wednesday evening, according to the Met Office map.\n\nREAD MORE: M4, A404(M) and A34 road closures this week as National Highways issues diversions\n\nThe weather map suggests that much of Tuesday will be relatively dry in Berkshire with the odd damp spell in the early afternoon. Whilst much of southern England will see a wet start to Wednesday, it will be mostly dry in Berkshire with the wet and wild conditions not forecast until mid-afternoon.\n\nBy 3pm there could be some heavy rain and possible hail lasting until around 6pm at which point the snow and sleet will begin arriving. By 8pm on Wednesday, almost all of Berkshire could be experiencing snowfall, according to the Met Office map, which will last for around an hour before turning into rain - Thursday morning may be damp but no further snow is expected.\n\nIn its warning, the Met Office has said: \"An area of rain, sleet and snow is expected to develop over southwest England during Tuesday evening and move east during early Wednesday before clearing mid-morning. Whilst drier conditions may develop for a time through the middle of the day, a further spell of sleet and snow is likely to develop during the afternoon and move east into the evening.\n\n\"There remains significant uncertainty in how far north snow develops as well as whether accumulations are focused mainly over higher ground. At this stage, the focus for the higher snow accumulations is across England south of the M4 during later Wednesday where there is a chance that some places could see 5-10 cm falling in a few hours.\n\n\"Earlier in the day and across the wider warning area, accumulations are expected to be lower, typically 1-3 cm. As snow clears on Wednesday night, clearing skies will result in ice developing on untreated surfaces with impacts lingering into Thursday morning.\"\n\nA more recent update to the warning reads: \"Warning extended further north across a larger part of southern England and East Anglia, with the likelihood of impacts increased, and ice included as part of the warning. The warning has also been extended into Thursday, primarily to include residual ice impacts that may persist into the morning travel period.\"\n\nThe Met Office has warned that travel networks, including cars, bus and train services, could be affected by the snow and ice with journey times expected to be longer than usual. If the snow is severe, there could also be some road closures and instances of people getting stranded or villages cut off.\n\nPedestrians should take care when outside as untreated pavements or cycle paths could become slippery, increasing the risk of injuries. Power cuts and loss of other important services is possible.\n\nGet more news from BerkshireLive straight to your inbox for free HERE .\n\nRead next:\n\nWhy Reading's Maiwand Lion will be covered up for the next few weeks\n\nNewbury secondary school closed after server malfunction causes 'safety issues'\n\nPerson found dead on tracks on GWR line between Reading and Slough\n\nSlough recycling bin collections could be a day late this week due to staff sickness\n\nReading robbery sees woman 'pulled to the floor' as two suspects steal her bag",

                    "body": "Double up on the duvets and wear your fluffiest jumper tonight as it could be the coldest night of the year.\n\nThe Met Office has announced that temperatures could plummet to minus 15C in some sheltered Scottish glens and have also issued weather warnings for snow and ice across the UK.\n\nCurrently, the lowest temperature that has been recorded in the UK this year is minus 10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of January 19.\n\nTemperatures are set to drop almost six degrees below their coldest last March, when they reached minus 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.\n\nWeather warnings for snow and ice are in place across all four nations of the UK and more are expected to be issued as Arctic air sweeps across the country.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice will be in place for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands, and South Wales from 9pm on Monday night until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nThe same warning will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England.\n\nSnow began falling in Northern Scotland on Monday afternoon. More than 20cm of it could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than 5cm is likely to accumulate at lower levels in the north-east of the UK.\n\nThe Met Office said snow will move from the south to the north of the UK as mild air from the south-west meets cold air.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to minus 1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year,\" Madge says.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude. \"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements, and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\n\"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected,\" Dale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said.",

(Image: The Met Office)\n\nThe Met Office added: \"Bus and train services may be delayed or cancelled, with some road closures and longer journey times possible.\n\n\"Some rural communities could become temporarily cut off, power cuts may occur and other services may be temporarily affected.\n\n\"Untreated pavements and cycle paths might be impassable with a chance of injuries from slips and falls on snow-covered or icy surfaces.\"\n\nA Met Office spokesperson explained the reason for the extended weather warnings.\n\nThe spokesperson said: \"The warning has been extended further north across a larger part of southern England and East Anglia, with the likelihood of impacts increased, and ice included as part of the warning.\n\n\"Warning has also been extended into Thursday, primarily to include residual ice impacts that may persist into the morning travel period.\"\n\nThe Met Office said yesterday the weather band that was set to hit Wales could bring 1 to 2cm of snow to some areas.\n\nA Met Office spokesperson said: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nThe yellow weather warning is set to come into force at midnight tonight. (Image: PA)\n\nThis is every region of Wales that could see snow as the Met Office issues a yellow weather warning:",

Other areas, even at low elevations, could see between 5-10 cm of snow, the warning notes.\n\nScotland could also be met with blizzard conditions and drifting of lying slow given the potential for strong winds.\n\nThe warning reads: Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK. Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places.\n\n\"In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\n\nThe Met Office said there is a small chance that \"long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel could occur, alongside \"long interruptions to power supplies and other services, such as gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage\" may occur.\n\nThere is also a slight chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers and a small chance that \"communities could be cut off for several days\", it added.",

The forecasting service issued a new warning on Tuesday morning as some forecasters warn of \"disruptive\" snow by the end of the week.\n\nThere are now two different yellow warnings for Wales on Thursday that cover most of the country. The new warning for south Wales warns that ice could cause issues during the morning commute on Thursday.\n\nA yellow warning that starts at midnight on Wednesday and now runs until 9am on Thursday says: \"An area of rain, sleet and snow is expected to develop over southwest England during Tuesday evening and move east during early Wednesday before clearing mid-morning. Whilst drier conditions may develop for a time through the middle of the day, a further spell of sleet and snow is likely to develop during the afternoon and move east into the evening. There remains significant uncertainty in how far north snow develops as well as whether accumulations are focused mainly over higher ground.\"\n\nRead more: Met Office forecast as weather warnings for snow and ice descend on Wales\n\nThe warning continues: \"At this stage, the focus for the higher snow accumulations is across England south of the M4 during later Wednesday where there is a chance that some places could see 5-10 cm falling in a few hours. Earlier in the day and across the wider warning area, accumulations are expected to be lower, typically 1-3 cm. As snow clears on Wednesday night, clearing skies will result in ice developing on untreated surfaces with impacts lingering into Thursday morning.\"\n\nThere are also warnings for snow in north Wales on Thursday and Friday, from 3am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday.\n\nThe yellow warning says: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK. Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places. In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nBBC Wales forecaster Rhian Haf warned of \"disruptive snow\" in some parts of Wales on Thursday into Friday.

                    "body": "Parts of the country are already covered in snow - and it is expected to keep falling throughout the week.\n\nThey are all under a yellow weather warning for snow and ice today with London, Oxford, Birmingham and Northern Ireland predicted to start clearing up overnight.\n\nBut the snow is set to move further south tomorrow, hitting Plymouth and Exeter while remaining in Newcastle and Scotland.\n\nThe weather warning is scheduled to be lifted from southern England, Wales and parts of northern Scotland on Thursday, but it will move to cover almost the entirety of the north in England.\n\nThis includes Stoke-on-Trent, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield. The whole of Northern Ireland is at risk of seeing snow again on this day too.\n\nThings look the same for Friday, with rain and snow moving north this weekend.\n\nThe Met Office said the cold snap may last two weeks and temperatures in parts of the UK will not reach double digits until Thursday.\n\nThe mercury could drop to -15\u00b0C in some areas of the Scottish Highlands - where up to 16 inches of snow could accumulate.\n\nMet Office chief meteorologist Dan Suri warned about the weather causing travel disruption with some rural communities in the north at risk of being completely cut off.\n\nHe explained that the UK is facing an Arctic maritime air mass - a low-pressure system - coming in from the North.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year is -10.4\u00b0C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of January 19.\n\nMr Suri said snow is not the only danger this week, stressing that ice poses many risks too.\n\nHe said: 'Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.'\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency issued a cold weather warning last weekend and placed north-west England and Yorkshire under a level 3 alert.\n\nThis means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable people. The rest of the UK has been placed under level 2.",

As snow clears on Wednesday night, clearing skies will result in ice developing on untreated surfaces with impacts lingering into Thursday morning.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"",

                    "body": "The Met Office has named the areas that could get the most snow over the next four days, as many parts of Scotland have been placed under a yellow weather warning.\n\nThe northeast has already seen wintery conditions arrive as Aberdeen has woken up to a thick blanket of the white stuff - and there could be more to come.\n\nThe Met Office has warned that even lower areas in the northeast could expect some 5cm of snow early this week, while higher areas could see more than 20cm. But by Thursday, most of Scotland will be enveloped in a snow warning as the Arctic blast continues.\n\nElsewhere in the UK, the Met Office have said that snowy conditions this week could reach as far south as northern England and Northern Ireland.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off.\"\n\nThe weather expert adds that Ice could provide an \"additional hazard\" for many with overnight temperatures dropping well below 0C for many.\n\nAs for the latter parts of the week, Met Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said the areas that would be most impacted aren't yet known, and that more warnings are likely to arrive.\n\nHe said: \"Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall.\n\n\"With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.\"\n\nSnow weather warning areas: Tuesday and Wednesday\n\nCentral, Tayside & Fife\n\nAngus Dundee Fife Perth and Kinross\n\nGrampian\n\nAberdeen Aberdeenshire Moray\n\nHighlands & Eilean Siar\n\nNa h-Eileanan Siar Highland\n\nOrkney & Shetland\n\nOrkney Islands Shetland Islands\n\nSW Scotland, Lothian Borders\n\nEast Lothian Edinburgh Midlothian Council Scottish Borders\n\nStrathclyde\n\nArgyll and Bute Snow weather warning areas: Thursday and Friday\n\nCentral, Tayside & Fife\n\nAngus Clackmannanshire Dundee Falkirk Fife Perth and Kinross Stirling\n\nGrampian\n\nAberdeen Aberdeenshire Moray\n\nHighlands & Eilean Siar\n\nHighland\n\nSW Scotland, Lothian Borders\n\nDumfries and Galloway East Lothian Edinburgh Midlothian Council Scottish Borders West Lothian\n\nStrathclyde\n\nArgyll and Bute East Ayrshire East Dunbartonshire East Renfrewshire Glasgow Inverclyde North Ayrshire North Lanarkshire Renfrewshire South Ayrshire South Lanarkshire West Dunbartonshire\n\nJames Coles of Scottish Mountain Rescue and Team Leader at Moffat Mountain Rescue commented: \"The UK is entering a period of increasingly challenging weather conditions with snow, ice and gusty winds all featuring prominently in the forecast for the coming week.\n\n\"Upland areas, especially in the mountains, can see conditions change very rapidly and they may be markedly different from surrounding lowland areas.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - sign up to our daily newsletter here .\n\nREAD NEXT: Exact time snow will fall in Scotland as Arctic blast sweeps country Veg seller explains why shops are facing shortages but greengrocers aren't Baby name specialist reveals 50 'best' choices to pick in 2023",

                    "body": "Scotland woke up to snow today as the Met Office has warned tonight may be the coldest of the year.\n\nWith yellow weather warnings in place until Friday, March 10, there is a chance temperatures may plummet to -15C on Tuesday night in some Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snowfall.\n\nNew weather maps by the Met Office show a bout of bone-chilling Arctic air travelling southwards across Scotland, bringing cold temperatures and snowfall on Tuesday.\n\nWeather warnings for snow and ice are in place across all four nations of the UK and more are expected to be issued as Arctic air sweeps across the country. Snow drifts could occur on Friday, the Met Office said.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year is minus 10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of January 19. Temperatures are set to drop almost six degrees below their coldest last March, when they reached minus 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.\n\nMeteorologist Alex Deacon said: \"There's low pressure heading down through the north sea and that has allowed the doors to open to Arctic air. We also have this weather front trickling southwards and that is going to produce a mixture of rain, sleet and snow across parts of the south on Tuesday morning and potentially, things could be pretty icy as well.\"\n\nSnow began falling in Northern Scotland on Monday afternoon. A yellow weather alert in place until Wednesday at 10am is set to impact north and eastern regions most, with up to 5cm of snowfall expected on lower ground, while higher areas will see up to 10cm.\n\nHowever a second warning in place from 3am on Thursday to 6pm on Friday could see more than 20cm of snowfall in parts of the country. Scotland is expected to see the heaviest fall on Friday as elevated areas could get a hefty 40cm.\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual. Scots in certain areas woke up to heavy snow on Tuesday morning and are facing \"significant disruptions\" due to closed roads.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said people should keep warm clothes and a torch in their car in case they get stuck in icy conditions.\n\nHe said: \"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\"\n\nOn March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low for the month of minus 22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.\n\nThe area of low pressure is to clear up by Wednesday, but will be replaced with a similar front moving from the west. By Thursday, it will travel over Scotland, brining moisture to colder air, resulting in \"heavy snowfall\", lasting until Friday.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here .\n\nREAD NEXT: Flight attendant explains benefit of skipping in-flight meals on long haul trips Experts reveal 'best' own-brand tomato soup - and it costs three times less than Heinz M&S brings back \u00a310 steak dinner bargain - but there's a catch",

                    "body": "A weather warning has been put in place for Burton and South Derbyshire as temperatures have dropped. The Met Office has put out a yellow warning for snow and ice today, Tuesday, March 7.\n\nThe weather warning is in place for this morning but it does appear to be a mostly dry and bright day, but cold as temperatures are only set to hit 4C at the highest. The warning states that ice and some snow could lead to difficult travel conditions in places.\n\nThe Met Office also has a second warning in place for snow on Thursday, March 9, with light snow showers forecast for throughout the morning. However, that is looking like it will turn to rain in the afternoon and the area does appear to be on the edge of the weather warning as the north of the country looks like it is to be hit a lot harder.\n\nThe warning states that snow has the potential to cause significant disruption and there is a small chance of delays to bus, rail and air travel. It states that some communities could be cut off as a result but as only light snow is forecast it appears that Burton and South Derbyshire will be less impacted than other areas.\n\nTomorrow, Wednesday, March 8, will be a less eventful day with the Met Office predicting it will be a cloudy start to the day which will change to sunny intervals by late morning. Temperatures will hit highs of 5C.\n\nNEWSLETTER: Sign up for free email alerts to StaffordshireLive straight to your inbox here\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nPlan to make Burton a tourist hotspot with its river the 'blue jewel'\n\n'Amazing' \u00a32k Titanic antique found hidden in Burton kitchen by Bargain Hunt's Charles Hanson\n\nMotorist calls for Romans to finish work in Shobnall Road in Burton after long delay\n\nNew shops and leisure unit set to open at growing Burton retail park\n\nTerrifying 'ghost train' reported in Swadlincote - by two police officers",

                    "body": "The Met Office has said people could be waking up to snow on Wednesday. And people in the Cotswolds could see a 'fair amount' of the white stuff tomorrow.\n\nPeople living in the north of England woke up to snow on Tuesday and it could be those further south who open their curtains to see snowfall on Wednesday. More than 10cm of snow fell in parts of northern Scotland on Monday and 20cm of snow could fall later in the week as a cold snap brings snow, ice, wind and rain.\n\nA severe weather warning for snow and ice will be in place for parts of Gloucestershire throughout Wednesday and has been extended into 9am on Thursday. The Met Office and BBC Weather have forecast heavy snow for the Forest of Dean either on Wednesday evening or the early hours of Thursday.\n\nREAD MORE: Live snow updates in Gloucestershire with major UK weather change underway\n\nPeople in southern England and South Wales can expect to wake up to snow on Wednesday but it is unclear whether it will settle, the Met Office has said. Snow is more likely to settle when it moves across much of northern England, Northern Ireland and much of Scotland on Thursday.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said people should \"expect to wake up to snow\" on Wednesday if they live in the South. He said: \"I think over higher grounds such as Exmoor, the Chilterns and the Cotswolds there will be a fair amount of snow.\n\n\"Elsewhere it is going to be quite difficult, especially after today's wet weather , to say how much snow will settle.\"\n\nTuesday could be the coldest night of the year so far with the mercury plunging to minus 15C in some isolated Scottish glens. South-west England, the south coast and South Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday and a few centimetres of it could fall in those areas.\n\nMr Burkill warned people to travel in snowy conditions only if essential and to bring a blanket in case they get stuck overnight. He said: \"Through the worst of the weather, keep up to date with warnings, be prepared your journey may take longer than normal and you may end up stranded in your car.\n\n\"If there is significant snow take water and maybe a blanket just in case, that's if you absolutely need to travel. Treat the weather sensibly and be aware it could be dangerous.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days. The agency's head of extreme events and health protection Dr Agostinho Sousa said people should check on vulnerable relatives and told pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nMet Office gives exact time heavy snow could hit Gloucestershire in UK winter blast Live snow updates in Gloucestershire with major UK weather change underway Gas pipeline through Cotswolds given go-ahead Schools close due to heating problems as temperatures fall in Gloucestershire New high-rise planned for Cheltenham near GCHQ",

                    "body": "People in England and Scotland have woken up to snow as a cold snap begins to hit the UK. More than 10cm of snow fell in parts of northern Scotland on Monday and 20cm of snow could fall later in the week as a cold snap brings snow, ice, wind and rain.\n\nTemperatures dipped to minus 7.6C at Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands on Monday night and the small hamlet was covered in 12cm of snow, more than anywhere else in the UK. Snow has also settled across Northumberland and North Yorkshire with some spots experiencing 2-3cm of cover.\n\nTuesday could be the coldest night of the year so far with the mercury plunging to minus 15C in some isolated Scottish glens. People in southern England and South Wales can expect to wake up to snow on Wednesday but it is unclear whether it will settle, the Met Office has said.\n\nSnow is more likely to settle when it moves across much of northern England, Northern Ireland and much of Scotland on Thursday. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said people should \"expect to wake up to snow\" on Wednesday if they live in the South.\n\nHe said: \"I think over higher grounds such as Exmoor, the Chilterns and the Cotswolds there will be a fair amount of snow. Elsewhere it is going to be quite difficult, especially after today's wet weather, to say how much snow will settle.\"\n\nHe added snow which is expected to fall in the north of England, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland on Thursday and Friday is likely to be \"much more impactful\".\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is in place in much of northern and eastern Scotland and north-east England until 10am on Wednesday. South-west England, the south coast and South Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday and a few centimetres of it could fall in those areas.\n\nMr Burkill said his area could be extended to include London. Northern England, North Wales, most of Scotland and Northern Ireland will be covered by a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday.",

                    "body": "People in the North of England and Scotland have woken up to snow as a cold snap begins to hit the UK.\n\nMore than 10cm of snow fell in parts of northern Scotland on Monday and 20cm of snow could fall later in the week as a cold snap brings snow, ice, wind and rain.\n\nTemperatures dipped to minus 7.6C at Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands on Monday night and the small hamlet was covered in 12cm of snow, more than anywhere else in the UK.\n\nSnow has also settled across Northumberland and North Yorkshire with some spots experiencing 2-3cm of cover.\n\nTuesday could be the coldest night of the year so far with the mercury plunging to minus 15C in some isolated Scottish glens.\n\nPeople in southern England and South Wales can expect to wake up to snow on Wednesday but it is unclear whether it will settle, the Met Office has said.\n\nSnow is more likely to settle when it moves across much of northern England, Northern Ireland and much of Scotland on Thursday.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said people should \"expect to wake up to snow\" on Wednesday if they live in the South.\n\nHe said: \"I think over higher grounds such as Exmoor, the Chilterns and the Cotswolds there will be a fair amount of snow.\n\n\"Elsewhere it is going to be quite difficult, especially after today's wet weather, to say how much snow will settle.\"\n\nHe added snow which is expected to fall in the north of England, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland on Thursday and Friday is likely to be \"much more impactful\".\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is in place in much of northern and eastern Scotland and north-east England until 10am on Wednesday.\n\nSouth-west England, the south coast and South Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday and a few centimetres of it could fall in those areas.\n\nMr Burkill said his area could be extended to include London.\n\nNorthern England, North Wales, most of Scotland and Northern Ireland will be covered by a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday.\n\nMr Burkill warned people to travel in snowy conditions only if essential and to bring a blanket in case they get stuck overnight.\n\nHe said: \"Through the worst of the weather, keep up to date with warnings, be prepared your journey may take longer than normal and you may end up stranded in your car.\n\n\"If there is significant snow take water and maybe a blanket just in case, that's if you absolutely need to travel.\n\n\"Treat the weather sensibly and be aware it could be dangerous.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nThe agency's head of extreme events and health protection Dr Agostinho Sousa said people should check on vulnerable relatives and told pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C.",

                    "body": "Tuesday night could be the coldest so far this year with temperatures expected to drop as low as -15\u00b0C in the UK, the Met Office has warned.\n\nThis would break the current record of -10.4\u00b0C recorded in the Scottish Highlands earlier this year.\n\nThe coldest areas on Tuesday are likely to be in sheltered Scottish glens, particularly where there is fresh snow cover.\n\nThe Met Office and the UK's Health Security Agency issued warnings for snow and ice in large parts of the country this week.\n\nThe arctic air sweeping across the UK is due to a \"highly amplified\" jet stream, mixed with an area of lower pressure over the mid-North Atlantic, which is pushing air up into northern areas and back down towards the UK.\n\nYellow warnings have been issued across the UK, with London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands, and South Wales all affected from 9pm on Monday night until 10am on Tuesday. Northern Ireland will also be affected during this time.\n\nAnother yellow warning is in place for much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and north-east England until 10am on Wednesday. South-west England and South Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday, with a few centimetres of snow expected to fall in those areas.\n\nThe Met Office warnings for ice and some snow could lead to difficult travel conditions in some places. A band of rain is expected to move southward through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, which could turn into snow on hills and possibly lower levels in some areas.\n\nWhile many areas will see little to no accumulation of snow, 1 to 2cm could settle in some spots, particularly over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\nThe rain and snow are expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. However, as skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\n\nThe Met Office urged people in affected areas to stay alert to changing weather and heed the advice of local authorities. It's also advisable to take necessary precautions, such as dressing warmly and driving safely on icy roads.\n\nThe Met Office has issued some guidance for driving in the heavy snow and icy conditions.",

National Grid is warming its emergency coal plants in case they're needed today.\n\nThe National Grid Electricity System Operators said: \"This notification is not confirmation that the unit will be used on Tuesday, but that it will be available to the ESO, if required. The ESO as a prudent system operator has developed these tools for additional contingency to operate the network as normal.\n\n\"This does not mean electricity supplies are at risk.\" Tuesday night could be the coldest of the year so far, the Met Office has announced, as it issued weather warnings for snow and ice across the UK.\n\nREAD MORE Met Office shares exact date -10C snow blast ends and UK finally warms up\n\nThe forecasting body said the mercury could drop to minus 15C in some sheltered Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snow cover. The lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year is minus 10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of January 19.\n\nTemperatures are set to drop almost six degrees below their coldest last March, when they reached minus 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to minus 1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year,\" he warned. The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude. We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.",

                    "body": "From Tyneside to Buckinghamshire, snow fell across the much of the country on Tuesday as forecasters warned temperatures could plunge to a 2023 record low of -15C in some parts.\n\nThe Met Office says the mercury could dip to the lowest of the year so far in some sheltered Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snow cover.\n\nWarnings for snow and ice are in place across all four nations of the UK and more are expected to be issued as Arctic air sweeps across the country.\n\nRelated: UK weather: Tuesday night could be coldest of year so far, Met Office warns\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year is -10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of 19 January.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, people were waking up to snow across Scotland, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Yorkshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to drop almost 6C below their coldest last March, when they reached -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice will be in place for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and south Wales until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time. A yellow weather warning for snow and ice is in place in much of Northern and eastern Scotland and north-east England.\n\nThe area covered by it is likely to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at about 10am on Wednesday.\n\nSouth-west England and south Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday and a few centimetres of snow could fall in those areas.\n\nNorth England, north Wales, most of Scotland and Northern Ireland will be covered by a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday.\n\nThe Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year. The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer, because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office said travel disruption was likely and journey times by car, train and bus could take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nDale Hipkiss, the national network manager at National Highways, said people should keep warm clothes and a torch in their car in case they got stuck in icy conditions.\n\nHe said: \"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England, which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nThe agency's head of extreme events and health protection, Dr Agostinho Moreira de Sousa, said people should check on vulnerable relatives and advised pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C.",

                    "body": "Warnings issued for snow and ice across all four nations with temperature forecast to plunge to -15\n\nFrom Tyneside to Buckinghamshire, snow fell across the much of the country on Tuesday as forecasters warned temperatures could plunge to a 2023 record low of -15C in some parts.\n\nThe Met Office says the mercury could dip to the lowest of the year so far in some sheltered Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snow cover.\n\nWarnings for snow and ice are in place across all four nations of the UK and more are expected to be issued as Arctic air sweeps across the country.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year is -10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of 19 January.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, people were waking up to snow across Scotland, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Yorkshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to drop almost 6C below their coldest last March, when they reached -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice will be in place for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and south Wales until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time. A yellow weather warning for snow and ice is in place in much of Northern and eastern Scotland and north-east England.\n\nThe area covered by it is likely to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at about 10am on Wednesday.\n\nSouth-west England and south Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday and a few centimetres of snow could fall in those areas.\n\nNorth England, north Wales, most of Scotland and Northern Ireland will be covered by a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday.\n\nThe Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year. The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer, because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office said travel disruption was likely and journey times by car, train and bus could take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nDale Hipkiss, the national network manager at National Highways, said people should keep warm clothes and a torch in their car in case they got stuck in icy conditions.\n\nHe said: \"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England, which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nThe agency's head of extreme events and health protection, Dr Agostinho Moreira de Sousa, said people should check on vulnerable relatives and advised pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C.",

It comes as a yellow weather warning is in place across the city from midnight tonight until 11.59pm on Wednesday.\n\nUK Weather Chase has warned of ice on untreated surfaces and expects to see between 5cm to 10cm of snow across Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor and Exmoor. It also added that 'many parts can expect accumulations of 1cm to 2cm of snow'.\n\nIn a post of Facebook, UK Weather Chase said: \"Looks like some of us could be waking up Wednesday morning to snow. Those in the South, Southwest and wales looks to be in the potential snow threat following the yellow warning issued by the Met Office.\n\n\"Spells of snow reaching parts of southwest England late on Tuesday evening will then spread north during the early hours of Wednesday before clearing away eastwards during Wednesday daytime. Many parts can expect accumulations of 1 to 2cm of snow whilst over higher parts of southwest England, especially Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor and Exmoor, along with the hills and mountains of south Wales 5 to 10cm of snow is likely for some.\n\n\"Untreated surfaces are also expected to become icy. We will indeed be observing locally around Dartmoor National Park and will throughout keep everyone posted.\"\n\nThe yellow weather warning affecting part of Plymouth and large parts of Devon and Cornwall is for snow and is active from midnight tonight and 11.59pm on Wednesday. The Met Office says: \"A period of snow is likely to cause some travel disruption during Wednesday.\"\n\nThe Met Office says to expect There is a small chance of travel delays on roads with some stranded vehicles and passengers, along with delayed or cancelled rail and air travel There is a slight chance that some rural communities could become cut off There is a small chance that power cuts will occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected A small chance of injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces There is a slight chance that bus and train services may be delayed or cancelled, with some road closures and longer journey times\n\nDevon and Cornwall is not currently included in any other Met Office warnings throughout the week. The majority of Scotland, parts of northern England, the Midlands, north Wales and Northern Ireland are all covered by a warning for heavy snow on Thursday and Friday.\n\nMet Office chief meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many.

                    "body": "Devon is set for flurries of snow and heavy rain tomorrow (March 8). The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow which covers the county.\n\nThe warning is in place from midnight tonight and is set to remain in place until 11.59pm tomorrow. The Exeter-based forecaster says: \"A period of snow is likely to cause some travel disruption during Wednesday.\"\n\nAccording to the latest forecast, Dartmoor is set to see flurries of the white stuff as early as 1am tomorrow. It will gradually get heavier throughout the morning before turning into heavy rain by midday.\n\nREAD MORE: Huge barn fire sees 300 sheep rescued in Kingsbridge\n\nElsewhere in the county, Crediton should expect light snow throughout tonight before ending by around 10am tomorrow. However, Exeter, Torbay and North Devon are set to see more rain than snow during the yellow warning.\n\nThe radar suggests that light rain will hit Exeter by 10am tomorrow, before turning heavier through the afternoon. It adds that \"feels like\" temperatures will hover between 0C and -1C throughout the day.\n\nMeanwhile, heavy rain is set to batter Torbay for much of the 24-hour warning. Similarly, residents in North Devon should expect downpours from around 1am until the end of the day.\n\nHere is what the Met Office says to expect during the weather warning:\n\nThere is a small chance of travel delays on roads with some stranded vehicles and passengers, along with delayed or cancelled rail and air travel. There is a slight chance that some rural communities could become cut off. There is a small chance that power cuts will occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected. A small chance of injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces. There is a slight chance that bus and train services may be delayed or cancelled, with some road closures and longer journey times. Met Office five-day forecast for the South West\n\nToday: Cloudy on Tuesday with outbreaks of rain and sleet, perhaps some snow, especially over hills. This gradually moves its way southwards, turning patchier and lighter though staying rather cloudy. Feeling cold. Maximum temperature 7C.\n\nTonight: Outbreaks of rain, sleet and snow likely to spread northeastwards overnight, with some lying snow likely by dawn, especially over higher ground. Cold with the risk of icy patches. Minimum temperature -1C.\n\nWednesday: Mostly cloudy with further outbreaks of mainly light rain, sleet, or snow during the morning. Briefly turning drier before rain or snow returns later with strengthening winds. Maximum temperature 6C.\n\nOutlook for Thursday to Saturday: Turning milder later in the week though staying unsettled with further rain at times and often rather windy, with some strong winds on Friday. A slight improvement on Saturday.\n\nRead next:\n\nFamily nearly hit by boy racers on troubled road\n\nDerelict Johnsons Cleaners site in Exeter to be turned into student flats\n\nFurther problems plague controversial Exeter high-rise home development\n\nTown in shock after Ukrainian schoolgirl's unexplained death\n\nMet Office maps show where and when it will snow in Devon",

                    "body": "Weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office for Lincolnshire over the next four days with 'heavy snow' expected later this week. Forecast snowfall will mostly affect northern Lincolnshire and near the coast on Tuesday, March 7 and Wednesday, March 8, before it heads further south on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe Met Office has sent out a yellow-grade snow and ice warning for the north of England, including the region around Hull, Grimsby, Waltham and Immingham. According to the forecaster, 'frequent snow showers' will potentially cause disruption for motorists and rural residents.\n\nMet Office guidance says that, under a yellow ice and snow warning, there is a \"small chance\" of travel delays - including the potential cancellation of rail and air services - and of people slipping and injuring themselves. Power cuts could also occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, could be affected.\n\nRead more: 34-hour snow warning for Lincolnshire as plunging temperatures spark health alert\n\nSome rural communities could even be \"cut off\". The cold weather is expected to then creep further south into Lincolnshire on Thursday.\n\nA separate yellow-grade snow warning has been issued from 3am on Thursday, March 9 until 6pm on Friday,March 10 with Lincoln set to be in the very heart of it. According to projections, Spilsby will be the cut-off for the east of the county.\n\nWhile towns like Coningsby will be affected, the bad weather will not go further south than Sleaford. The \"heavy snow\" forecast has the potential to cause \"significant disruptions\" across the two days.\n\nThe Met Office has said there is a \"slight\" chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow, stranding drivers, and that communities could again be \"cut off\" for several days. On top of the small chance that power supplies and other services, such as gas, water and phone coverage, could be interrupted for a long time, there is also the same 'small chance' that bus, rail and air services could suffer delays or cancellations.\n\nDrivers wishing to travel in snowy and icy conditions should follow the Met Office's guidance on how to stay safe.\n\nPoll: Are you planning an event for King Charles III's coronation?\n\nRead next:\n\nExercise Cobra Warrior: Weather forecast for week ahead\n\nLife in the village next to 'the worst road in Lincolnshire'\n\nThe Roman roads in Lincolnshire you might drive on every day\n\nExercise Cobra Warrior: Special exclusive spectator event sells out in under an hour\n\nFamily of man killed on first day of lockdown left 'alone and lost' after fatal crash",

While the week already kicked off with a clear drop in temperatures and some snow, Meteolux has just issued a yellow snow alert for Wednesday.\n\nThe alert will be in effect for the whole country until 8am, with \"4 to 8 cm of snow potentially accumulating in the north and 1 to 2 cm in the south.\"\n\nTemperatures are expected to start at 0\u00b0C on Wednesday before rising to 9\u00b0C in the afternoon. The following days, a renewed increase in temperatures should keep the risk of more snow at bay, but the sky is still expected to remain rainy and grey until Sunday.",

It adds: \"There is a slight chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers. There is a small chance that communities could be cut off for several days.\n\n\"There is also small chance that long interruptions to power supplies and other services, such as gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage, may occur.\" According to the map showing the alert, the warning stretches down from Scotland to just south of Nottingham.\n\nRead more: Hour by hour Nottinghamshire weather forecast as Met Office warning issued for snow and ice\n\nThe Met Office forecast for this period suggests that the temperature will be as low as 0C but will feel like -3C due to wind chill. The BBC says that sleet and wintry showers are likely to reach Nottingham around 9am on Thursday - and last for a number of hours.\n\nThe whole day could see lots of rain - and if the temperature is cold enough it could turn to snow and sleet. The Met Office forecast for Thursday in Nottingham says: \"Staying cold with frosts overnight. Risk of disruptive snow and strong winds to occur on Thursday and Friday. Saturday looking drier and brighter.\"\n\nThe longer range predictions from Saturday March 11 - Monday March 20 adds: \"Confidence in the details are low throughout this period. On Saturday, cold conditions are expected across the north, accompanied by showers, some of these possibly wintry, although some sunny spells are possible.\"\n\nIt comes as a nationwide level three cold weather alert has been put in place by the Met Office and the UK Health Security Agency. The alert warns the weather will turn extremely cold from 1am Monday (March 6) to midnight on Wednesday (March 8).\n\nCommenting on the alert, Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nRead next:\n\nNew traders in as unique shop bounces back from liquidation Part of the city centre where a number of shops have closed Gym demolition in restoration of railway station with rich history Life in the Nottinghamshire village that is 'so unique' it attracts shoppers from across county 'Mid-range hotel' among calls for city's former Debenhams building",

Flights began taking off again at 8am.\n\nWeather warnings for Monday and Tuesday were issued last week, covering northern and eastern parts of the country.\n\nSnowfall was forecast across the Western Isles, Highlands, northwest, Orkney, Shetland and down the east coast of Scotland, with STV meteorologist Sean Batty warning temperatures would plunge as low as -15C in areas.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the Met Office additionally confirmed that central, western and southern areas can also expect to see severe snowfall.\n\nThe second yellow alert will come into effect at 3am on Thursday and covers all of Scotland, with only the northern Highlands and islands excluded. The warning is in force until 6pm on Friday.\n\nThe Met Office said snow could develop quite widely as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK, with parts of Scotland and northern England forecast to see the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\nUp to 10cm is expected widely, even on lower ground - with accumulations as much as 20cm forecast up north.\n\nHigher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 40cm of snow in places.\n\nThe Met Office said there was a chance some rural communities could become cut off, with chances of power cuts and adverse affects on other services, such as mobile phone coverage.\n\nDrivers have been warned to take extra care with delays on roads and risk of strandings likely with rail and air travel also facing possible disruption.",

                    "body": "THE heaviest snowfall since The Beast From the East could bring Scotland to a standstill this week with up to 16 INCHES of the white stuff.\n\nForecasters are warning that \"very challenging conditions\" will sweep in on Thursday and Friday, potentially cutting off remote communities for several days and stranding motorists in their vehicles.\n\nUntil now, it has been the north of the country which has suffered the worst of the whiteout conditions but now the nation's areas of mass population are in the eye of the snow storm, including Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n\nOn top of that, the mercury was expected to plunge to Minus 15C (5F) this morning (Tues) to give us the coldest day of the year so far.\n\nThe grim forecast comes almost five years to the day since the Beast from the East paralysed the nation in early March 2018.\n\nGrahame Madge of the Met Office said:\"We are about to enter a particularly eventful period of weather.\n\n\"Freezing conditions, coupled with heavy snow and drifting all mean that peoples' travel plans will have to be urgently reviewed.\n\n\"These risks will only increase as we go through the week.\n\n\"I strongly advise people to stay in touch with the forecast and be prepared to cancel travel plans accordingly.\n\n\"The warning is suggesting as much as 16 inches of snow, but with winds whipping it into blizzards, accumulations of even greater than that are possible.\"\n\nOn Thursday into Friday, as much as 30-40cm (12-16 inches) could be dumped on higher parts of the central belt, the southern uplands and southern Highlands.\n\nThis would affect major road links to the south, including the A1, M74 and the M8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nRail journeys are also likely to be affected and airports may find it impossible to keep runways clear of snow.\n\nThe yellow warning states:\"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\n\"Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm (up to 4 inches) of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 inches) accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area.\n\n\"Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 inches) of snow in places.\n\n\"In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nThe warning also predicts possible 'long interruptions' to power supplies, phone and mobile phone connections.\n\nElectricity companies are expected to put repair teams into areas most likely to be affected, schools will almost certainly close and the Scottish Government will activate its resilience team to co-ordinate recovery efforts.\n\nYesterday, the first effects of the Arctic blast were felt in Aberdeenshire, where some motorists became stuck on the A939 Cockbridge to Tomintoul road.\n\nAn HGV also lost traction before making it up one of the highest points on the road.\n\nSnow and ice warnings for the north remain in place right through the week and by the time they end on Friday, they will have been in place for a consecutive 79 hours.\n\nThis morning Glasgow could be down to Minus 3C or Minus 4C (24-26F) but by tomorrow morning (Weds) Scotland's biggest city could see Minus 7C (19F).",

                    "body": "Somerset is braced for snow and freezing temperatures throughout tonight and tomorrow (March 8). The Met Office has issued two yellow weather warnings covering the county as snow is forecast to impact the region.\n\nThe first warning - for snow and ice - came into force at 9pm yesterday (March 6) and is due to deactivate at 10am. The second is for snow from midnight tonight through to 11.59pm tomorrow.\n\nThe Exeter-based forecaster says that \"a period of snow\" is likely to hit the county by early evening tomorrow. It adds that travel disruption is likely.\n\nREAD MORE: Cat rescued from Bridgwater house fire that was caused by electric blanket\n\nLocally, Taunton is set for \"feels like\" temperatures below 0C for most of the day tomorrow. The Met Office predicts sleet to arrive at 5pm before turning into heavy snow at 7pm.\n\nThe outlook is similar for Bath, with residents expecting flurries of the white stuff from around 5pm. The heavy snow is forecast to arrive at 7pm, lasting until 10pm.\n\nMeanwhile, Wells should see slightly lighter snow following a period of sleet at 6pm. In Yeovil, heavy snow will arrive at 6pm before easing by 10pm.\n\nAccording to the radar, Frome is braced for heavy snow fall between 6pm and 9pm. It will then ease into light snow before stopping completely by 11pm.\n\nFinally, Weston-super-Mare looks set to avoid the worst of the snow. However, 'feels like' temperatures will be around -4C by the early evening after a day of heavy rain.\n\nHere is what the Met Office says to expect during the snow warning:\n\nThere is a small chance of travel delays on roads with some stranded vehicles and passengers, along with delayed or cancelled rail and air travel. There is a slight chance that some rural communities could become cut off. There is a small chance that power cuts will occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected. A small chance of injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces. There is a slight chance that bus and train services may be delayed or cancelled, with some road closures and longer journey times. Met Office five-day forecast for the South West\n\nToday: Cloudy on Tuesday with outbreaks of rain and sleet, perhaps some snow, especially over hills. This gradually moves its way southwards, turning patchier and lighter though staying rather cloudy. Feeling cold. Maximum temperature 7C.\n\nTonight: Outbreaks of rain, sleet and snow likely to spread northeastwards overnight, with some lying snow likely by dawn, especially over higher ground. Cold with the risk of icy patches. Minimum temperature -1C.\n\nWednesday: Mostly cloudy with further outbreaks of mainly light rain, sleet, or snow during the morning. Briefly turning drier before rain or snow returns later with strengthening winds. Maximum temperature 6C.\n\nOutlook for Thursday to Saturday: Turning milder later in the week though staying unsettled with further rain at times and often rather windy, with some strong winds on Friday. A slight improvement on Saturday.\n\nRead next:\n\nMet Office maps show where and when it will snow in Somerset tomorrow\n\n'Panther' caught on camera in field by busy A-road\n\nEdward, 12, died days after family were called while on holiday at Center Parcs\n\nMan arrested after car reported stolen found in River Stour\n\nGlastonbury Festival 2023 line-up: Lana Del Rey appears to threaten to call off big Worthy Farm show",

                    "body": "Tuesday night could be the coldest night of the year for many, with temperatures expected to drop as low as -15C as the UK comes under an arctic blast.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England and the Met Office has urged people to check on relatives and friends who are vulnerable to icy weather, particularly the elderly.\n\nA level 3 alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severe cold weather, icy conditions and possibly snow between Monday and Thursday in parts of England.\n\nArctic air is sweeping across due to a \"highly amplified\" jet stream which is mixed with lower pressure over the mid-north Atlantic.\n\nThe Met Office has predicted London could dip as low as -1C overnight with patchy frost and icy stretches expected, mostly in the north.\n\nThe capital is also under a yellow snow and ice warning until 10am on Tuesday after a bitter and rainy Monday night. Some icy patches on roads may cause travel disruption.\n\nParts of England, including Northumberland and Yorkshire, woke up to fresh snow blanketing fields and houses.\n\nSnow and ice warnings have also been issued for northeastern areas of the UK, including parts of Northern Ireland, England and Wales, until Friday.\n\nAreas affected on Tuesday include Birmingham, Cardiff, Newcastle and most of Scotland.\n\nThe chilliest temperatures of the year are set for the Scottish Glens on Tuesday, with a forecast of -15C overnight.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year was -10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit on the shores of Loch Ness in the Highlands in the early hours of January 19.\n\nIn excess of 20cm of snow could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than 5cm is likely to accumulate even to lower levels in the northeast of the UK, the Met Office said.\n\nChief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\"\n\nSouthern England and south Wales are likely to wake up to \"couple of centimetres of snow\" on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn London further snow is expected on Wednesday evening with \"some heavier bursts possible at times\", with a maximum temperature of 4C.\n\nOn Thursday and Friday the snow risk is forecast to spread to central and northern areas of the UK.\n\nTemperatures will creep back up for London later this week, with a high of 9C on Thursday and 10C on Friday.",

                    "body": "Snow has fallen in the home counties as Britain braces for its coldest night of the year.\n\nArctic air is continuing to move south across the country, with the temperature forecast to drop as low as -15C on Tuesday evening in the Scottish Glens.\n\nThis would surpass the current lowest temperature of -10.4C, recorded at Drumnadrochit, a village near Inverness in the Highlands on January 19.\n\nAlready, parts of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Suffolk have awoken to snow on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for snow and ice across parts of south-east England, London, south-west England, the Midlands and Wales throughout Wednesday, with the north-east of England, Yorkshire and most of Scotland also covered.\n\nIt means disruption to some roads and railways is likely, along with a risk of falls.\n\nForecasters are expecting two to six centimetres of snow and 10cm on higher ground across the south of England and the Midlands.\n\nHowever, \"heavy snow\" is then expected to sweep across England and Scotland north of Birmingham on Thursday and Friday, of 20cm on lower ground and 40cm on higher ground, prompting another Met Office yellow warning which says it \"has the potential to cause significant disruption\".\n\nThe Met Office said \"there is a slight chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow\" and \"a small chance that communities could be cut off for several days\", with \"long delays\" in travel and power disruption also possible.\n\nDan Suri, the Met Office chief meteorologist, said: \"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off.\n\n\"Snow showers will continue through Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has extended its \"level three cold weather alert\" to cover the whole of England until midnight on Thursday, the second-highest alert it can issue.\n\nIt means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, and the coldest March night ever was in 1958, -22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

After snow was forecast on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week, meteorologists expect the weather to improve through the weekend.\n\nIn its forecast, the Met Office promises: \"Turning less cold by Saturday, with rain arriving later.\" Its outlook from March 11 onwards continues: \"Confidence in the details are low throughout this period. On Saturday, cold conditions are expected across the north, accompanied by showers, some of these possibly wintry, although some sunny spells are possible. Elsewhere, milder, cloudier conditions are likely, with outbreaks of rain and some stronger winds possible.\n\n\"Generally becoming somewhat milder through this period, but colder conditions may linger in the north.\" Meteorologist Alex Deakin has hinted at snow this week - saying: \"There's a low heading down through the North Sea, from the Arctic and that is where our weather is coming from.\n\nREAD MORE Met Office announces exact hour snow will hit and every area set for flurries - full list\n\n\"This weather front is wet, chiefly rain through Monday and into sleet and snow through the night. It could turn things icy - certainly the showers in Scotland will come in as snow. North East England and south Scotland could see sleet and hail, too.\" He added: \"It could potentially be icy as temperatures drop well below - it could be minus 10 in rural Scotland.\n\n\"Further south, temperatures stay a little above freezing.\" Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude. We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"",

                    "body": "SNOW has been pictured this morning on top of the Malvern Hills after a weather warning was issued across the county.\n\nThe yellow weather warning for snow and ice was issued yesterday for Worcestershire by the Met Office.\n\nIn the picture, the peaks of the hills can be seen covered with snow in the distance.\n\nThe weather warning came into effect at 9pm yesterday (Monday, March 6) and is set to last until 10am today (Tuesday, March 7).\n\nREAD MORE: Met Office snow and ice warning\n\nA spokesperson for the Met Office said: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but one to two centimetres could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday.\n\n\"As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nThe Met Office warns that some snow could lead to difficult travel conditions in places.\n\nSome roads and railways are likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services.\n\nPeople are also at risk of injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces.\n\nThere is likely to be some icy patches on untreated roads, pavements, and cycle paths.\n\nDo you have snow near you?

                    "body": "Snow is set to hit the county later this week.\n\nThe Met Office has issued a two-day yellow weather warning which comes into force later in the week.\n\nAccording to forecasters, snow will arrive early on Thursday morning (March 9). The warning comes into place from 3am and will last until 6pm on Friday.\n\nREAD MORE: Decision day for rival Cheshire village crematorium bids\n\nMost of the county will see temperatures of 0C or below freezing on Friday. Macclesfield will be coldest with predicted low of -2C. The likes of Chester and Crewe will see temperatures fall as low as -1C.\n\nThe warning states: \"Heavy snow has the potential to cause significant disruption on Thursday and Friday.\"\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"The impactful weather will continue through the second half of the week as mild air meets cold air with further snow, ice, wind and then rain likely later in the week and into the weekend. From Wednesday, the focus of further snow is across parts of southern England and south Wales, with snow likely to lower levels for a time, and many may wake up to a couple of centimetres of snow on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall. With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health. If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.''\n\nNEWSLETTER: Sign up for CheshireLive email direct to your inbox here\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nShocking moment huge tree falls onto busy Crewe road in felling blunder\n\nCheshire West and Chester Council set to spend \u00a36.3m on houses for Ukrainian and Afghan refugees\n\nMan who 'brought misery' to Chester is banned from city centre\n\nVan driver caught fly-tipping on secret camera in Ellesmere Port\n\nEllesmere Port florist shuts up shop due to 'astronomical running costs'",

                    "body": "Heavy snow could hit the South West in the next 24 hours and many could wake up to a couple of centimetres of the white stuff tomorrow morning, the Met Office says.\n\nThe greatest risk of snow will initially be in the south from later today and early tomorrow (Wednesday, March 8) as mild air gradually moves in from the South West but brings with it snow as it meets the cold air. This risk of snow gradually spreads further north through the latter half of the week and warnings have been issued.\n\nWeather warnings for snow and ice are in place every day for various regions this week, with a 24-hour snow warning in place for Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, Wiltshire, the South East and South Wales from 12am until 11.59pm tomorrow (March 8).\n\nREAD MORE: Met Office expects more weather warnings to come amid -15C Arctic blast\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"The impactful weather will continue through the second half of the week as mild air meets cold air with further snow, ice, wind and then rain likely later in the week and into the weekend.\n\n\"From Wednesday, the focus of further snow is across parts of southern England and south Wales, with snow likely to lower levels for a time, and many may wake up to a couple of centimetres of snow on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall. With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Met Office Somerset snow forecast - 24-hour timeline for Arctic forecast\n\nThe Met Office said: \"A period of snow is likely to cause some travel disruption during Wednesday.\"\n\nThere is a small chance of travel delays on roads with stranded vehicles and passengers, along with delayed or cancelled rail and air travel. There is a chance that some rural communities could be cut off and the potential for power cuts.\n\nA number of towns and villages across Somerset are forecast to see heavy snow, and it's expected from 5pm until 10pm in Yeovil and Taunton tomorrow.\n\nBy Friday, winds will also be increasing as low pressure moves in from the west. It remains uncertain where the boundary between the mild air to the south and cold air to the north will lie exactly, but southern areas are more likely to see cloud, wind and rain, while areas to the north of that boundary could see further disruptive snowfall, with strong winds possibly creating snowdrifts in places.\n\nMet Office five-day forecast for the South West\n\nToday: Cloudy on Tuesday with outbreaks of rain and sleet, perhaps some snow, especially over hills. This gradually moves its way southwards, turning patchier and lighter though staying rather cloudy. Feeling cold. Maximum temperature 7 \u00b0C.\n\nTonight: Outbreaks of rain, sleet and snow likely to spread northeastwards overnight, with some lying snow likely by dawn, especially over higher ground. Cold with the risk of icy patches. Minimum temperature -1 \u00b0C.\n\nWednesday: Mostly cloudy with further outbreaks of mainly light rain, sleet, or snow during the morning. Briefly turning drier before rain or snow returns later with strengthening winds. Maximum temperature 6 \u00b0C.\n\nOutlook for Thursday to Saturday: Turning milder later in the week though staying unsettled with further rain at times and often rather windy, with some strong winds on Friday. A slight improvement on Saturday.\n\nUK long range forecast\n\nMarch 11-20\n\nConfidence in the details are low throughout this period. On Saturday, cold conditions are expected across the north, accompanied by showers, some of these possibly wintry, although some sunny spells are possible. Elsewhere, milder, cloudier conditions are likely, with outbreaks of rain and some stronger winds possible. There is a small chance of more disruptive snowfall, particularly along the northern edge of the rain band. Into next week, milder conditions are expected to spread northeastwards, bringing rain and stronger winds, as well as some snow along the leading edges. Towards the end of the period, this transition is expected to continue, bringing more unsettled conditions. Periods of snow remain possible, particularly in the far north. Generally becoming somewhat milder through this period, but colder conditions may linger in the north.\n\nMarch 21-April 4\n\nConfidence remains fairly low during this period. It's likely to be drier further north apart from occasional wintry showers, while rain and strong winds are more likely in the south, with a lower risk of snow at times. These milder conditions may extend north periodically, but it's possible that the cold but bright weather could return south to all parts through late March, bringing a return to drier conditions to the south. Overall, a greater than normal chance of colder spells of weather, especially in the north.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nMet Office maps show where and when it will snow in Somerset tomorrow\n\n'Panther' caught on camera in field by busy A-road\n\nEdward, 12, died days after family were called while on holiday at Center Parcs\n\nMan arrested after car reported stolen found in River Stour\n\nGlastonbury Festival 2023 line-up: Lana Del Rey appears to threaten to call off big Worthy Farm show",

The Met Office reports that as well as some Northern Ireland and southern and central areas of England and Wales, snow and ice is expected.\n\nWhile a yellow warning for snow comes into place in the north west and Liverpool on Thursday, March 9 and Friday, March 10. The warning means that heavy snow has the potential to cause \"significant\" disruption on those days, according to forecasters.\n\nREAD MORE: Millions of dog owners hit with urgent warning from RSPCA\n\nSnow appears on the forecast from 9am on Thursday in Liverpool and will continue throughout the day. Sleet and snow will clear later on Friday, with it expected to turn less cold by Saturday.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nREAD NEXT: Live court updates as Thomas Cashman trial over Olivia Pratt-Korbel murder begins\n\nMan who stabbed his mum in pub car park cleared of murder\n\nThomas Cashman to claim gunman who killed Olivia Pratt-Korbel 'wasn't me', jury told\n\nUK snow map shows when snow is set to fall in Merseyside as Met Office issues new warning\n\nMatalan shoppers praise 'beautiful' \u00a39.50 storage baskets that 'look expensive'",

Here's what we know...\n\nThe UK could be facing four days of snow this week as a cold snap sweeps across the country.\n\nForecasters at the Met Office have put in place yellow weather warnings across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nTheir website states 'a major change' in the weather is underway, as cold air moves in from the north, bringing snow, ice and low temperatures.\n\nNortheastern areas of the UK will be worst hit, as well as some Northern Ireland and southern and central areas of England and Wales.\n\nMore than 20cm of snow could fall over high ground in Scotland, with 5cm settling to lower levels in the northeast.\n\nCommuters have been warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual. Rural areas may even be cut off from the national power grid.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nThe weather warnings will be in place until Friday, with forecasters also predicted Tuesday night could be the coldest of the year so far.\n\nFor some people, they could see temperatures drop to as low as -15C (5F), which will beat the current lowest of f -10.4C (13.3F), recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness on 19th January.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures would be \"much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year\".\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change,\" he said.",

Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing.\n\nSUB-ZERO temperatures this morning and overnight snow affecting stretches of several Highland routes has prompted a fresh \"take care\" plea to motorists amid the possibility of disruption to public transport.\n\nHeavy snow showers are forecast for some parts of the north-west Highlands today with warnings of treacherous conditions on some routes.\n\nA Met Office weather warning for snow and ice runs until 10am on Wednesday and then resumes in the early hours of Thursday until 6pm on Friday.\n\nBEAR Scotland, which manages the North West Trunk Roads Network, said this morning that overnight snow is affecting parts of the A9, A87 and A835 just now.\n\nIt also posted an image of a deer on the A87 at Cluanie with an appeal to drivers to be mindful of wildlife too in the wintry conditions.\n\nNorthern police has last night used its social meed feed to warn people to avoid the area surrounding the A87 near Drumuie, Isle of Skye. It said then road conditions were dangerous due to heavy snow and urged motorists to be aware of the weather warnings in place.\n\nStagecoach Highland this morning stated: \"Due to icy and snowy road conditions some services throughout the morning may be liable to experience delays and disruption. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\"\n\nThe forecast for today suggests sub-zero temperatures in many parts this morning with the temperature again dipping in the early evening onwards.\n\nIt's expected to plunge to -7C in Dingwall tomorrow morning.\n\nHeavy snow showers are forecast in Gairloch, Ullapool and Achiltibuie during the day.\n\nAs of 7.30am Highland Council had indicated a number of school closures on Skye, though that picture could change. It's school closure info, updated from 7am every morning, can be seen here.",

Some icy patches on roads may cause travel disruption.\n\nParts of England, including Northumberland and Yorkshire, woke up to fresh snow blanketing fields and houses.\n\nSnow and ice warnings have also been issued for northeastern areas of the UK, including parts of Northern Ireland, England and Wales, until Friday.\n\nAreas affected on Tuesday include Birmingham, Cardiff, Newcastle and most of Scotland.\n\nThe chilliest temperatures of the year are set for the Scottish Glens on Tuesday, with a forecast of -15C overnight.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year was -10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit on the shores of Loch Ness in the Highlands in the early hours of January 19.\n\nIn excess of 20cm of snow could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than 5cm is likely to accumulate even to lower levels in the northeast of the UK, the Met Office said.\n\nChief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\"\n\nSouthern England and south Wales are likely to wake up to \"couple of centimetres of snow\" on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn London further snow is expected on Wednesday evening with \"some heavier bursts possible at times\", with a maximum temperature of 4C.\n\nOn Thursday and Friday the snow risk is forecast to spread to central and northern areas of the UK.\n\nTemperatures will creep back up for London later this week, with a high of 9C on Thursday and 10C on Friday.",

                    "body": "Snow has already arrived in some parts of England and Scotland, amid reports of the 'Beast from the East' arriving. The Met Office has issued a number of warnings across the UK as a result.\n\nThe yellow weather warnings are in place for both snow and snow and ice. The first warning came into place last night and other separate warnings continue through the next four days until Friday, March 10.\n\nThe south west-based forecasters say to expect 'some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services'. It also warns to expect 'some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces' and 'probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths'.\n\nThe yellow weather warning affecting part of Plymouth and large parts of Devon and Cornwall is for snow and is active from midnight tonight and 11.59pm on Wednesday. The Met Office says: \"A period of snow is likely to cause some travel disruption during Wednesday.\"\n\nThe Met Office says to expect;\n\nThere is a small chance of travel delays on roads with some stranded vehicles and passengers, along with delayed or cancelled rail and air travel There is a slight chance that some rural communities could become cut off There is a small chance that power cuts will occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected A small chance of injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces There is a slight chance that bus and train services may be delayed or cancelled, with some road closures and longer journey times\n\nDevon and Cornwall is not currently included in any other Met Office warnings throughout the week. The majority of Scotland, parts of northern England, the Midlands, north Wales and Northern Ireland are all covered by a warning for heavy snow on Thursday and Friday.\n\nIn a statement, the Met Office said: \"A major change in the weather is underway for the UK, as cold air moves in from the north, bringing snow, ice and low temperatures for many. Warnings for snow and ice have been issued with the initial focus of the most impactful snow in northeastern areas of the UK, as well as some Northern Ireland and southern and central areas of England and Wales. Further warnings are likely to be issued throughout the week.\"\n\nMet Office chief meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nCold weather alert\n\nThe Met Office states: \"Ice will be an additional hazard for many through the week, with sub-zero temperatures creating some hazardous travel conditions. Temperatures could drop as low as -15\u00b0C overnight on Tuesday in some sheltered Scottish Glens, especially where there's fresh snow cover.\n\n\"The UK Health Security Agency has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\"\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.''\n\nWant more of the news you love?

                    "body": "SCOTS have been hit with fresh travel chaos as snow and ice battered the country overnight.\n\nAn urgent warning was issued last night after heavy snow sparked \"dangerous\" road conditions.\n\nFerocious flurries battered northern parts of the country throughout the day yesterday as the Met Office issued a yellow snow and ice warning for the north and east of Scotland.\n\nCops in the north had to urge drivers to avoid roads on the Isle of Skye because the snow had made the roads too dangerous.\n\nAnd now commuters face travel chaos this morning as more roads have been affected overnight.\n\nTraffic Scotland has warned drivers that a number of busy roads in the north of the country are currently closed before of heavy overnight snowfall.\n\nThe A93 route from Braemar to Spittal of Glenshee is shut as well as the A939 road from Cockbridge to Tomintoul.\n\nThe B974 road between Banchory and Fettercairn is also closed.\n\nMeanwhile numerous other roads remain open despite being blanketed in snow.\n\nThe A90, A92 and A956 around the Aberdeen area are among those that are badly affected, causing chaos for drivers.\n\nConditions on the A90 AWPR are \"particularly hazardous\" this morning, especially around the Kingswells area.\n\nBoth entry slip roads at Kingswells are currently blocked after to vehicles got stuck in the Snow.\n\nAnd the roads around Milltimber and Stonehaven are also covered in snow, causing traffic chaos.\n\nTraffic Scotland added that gritters have been out this morning and are \"doing their best to grit as much as they can\".\n\nThey urged people to take care on the roads.\n\nLast night Highland and Islands Police Division released a statement which read: \"Please avoid the area surrounding the A87 near Drumuie, Isle of Skye, as road conditions are dangerous due to heavy snow.\n\n\"Be aware of the weather warnings in place.\"\n\nYellow snow and ice warnings are set to be in place until Friday, with fresh snowfall to move south and batter the Central Belt throughout the week.\n\nBone-chilling temperatures of -10C are predicted for the parts of the country as the mercury plummets over the next few days.\n\nForecasters predict temperatures will drop below freezing tonight - the coldest air of the year so far - and will not top mid-single figures during the day on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nFrom Thursday, snow could develop quite widely across most of Scotland by as a deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\nHigher parts of the Central belt and the southern Highlands could may see between 30cm to 40cm of snow by Friday.",

                    "body": "Tonight could be the coldest of the year so far with temperatures dropping to as low as -15C, the Met Office has warned.\n\nThe UK's Health Security Agency has issued snow and ice warnings for large parts of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe chill is being driven by arctic air pushed down towards the UK by a combination of the jet stream and an area of low pressure over the Mid-North Atlantic.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures would be \"much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year\".\n\nHe said: \"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"",

The rest of the UK has been placed under level 2.\n\nThe forecaster has already warned of the risk of travel disruption in areas affected by snow with roads and railways expected to be icy.",

                    "body": "Temperatures are forecast to drop on Tuesday as cold air moves in from the north, bringing snow and ice. There is a yellow warning for snow and ice in place for a large part of Tuesday morning but no reports of any impactful snow conditions.\n\nBBC Wales weather forecaster Rhian Haf said that a band of rain overnight on Monday that moved south did bring some snow to the hills. She added: \"Ice has been forming on some untreated surfaces and there is a warning until 10am on Tuesday. The band of rain and snow will clear to leave a day that will be cloudy for a time, a few spot of rain but turning into a mostly dry afternoon with plenty of sunshine.\n\n\"Very cold with Arctic air, a few snow showers in place with temperatures between 2C and 5C. Another spell of snow and rain will move into southern areas during the early hours.\"\n\nRead more:Met Office issues new heavy snow warning over the next five days in Wales\n\nThere is another warning for snow in the south from midnight on Tuesday.\n\nRhian added: \"The snow will clear eastwards. Many parts can expect cumulations of 1cm to 2cm of snow over the hills and higher mountains and in some parts of south Wales 5 to 10cm is likely. We can all expect a widespread frost with temperatures dropping to -5C. Wednesday will be mostly cloudy, some rain and snow to start that will soon clear. Temperatures tomorrow between 2C and 5C.\"\n\nThe forecaster said that there could be some \"disruptive snow\" on Thursday into Friday in northern parts of Wales.\n\nThere are warnings for snow in north Wales on Thursday and Friday, from 3am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday.\n\nThe yellow warning says: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK. Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places. In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nThe Met Office forecast for Wales this weeks says:\n\nTuesday:\n\nA bright day in the north today with sunny spells and a few snow showers. Cloudier further south with outbreaks of light rain, sleet, and snow, which will slowly clear southwards throughout the day. Feeling cold. Maximum temperature 6 \u00b0C.\n\nTuesday night:\n\nA dry, clear and very frosty night in the north. Further south it will be often cloudy with some outbreaks of rain, sleet and snow affecting the far south. Minimum temperature -6 \u00b0C.\n\nWednesday:\n\nA bright and frosty start in the north, cloudier further south with some rain or snow, especially over higher ground. Feeling cold, with a brisk breeze in the south. Maximum temperature 5 \u00b0C.\n\nOutlook for Thursday to Saturday:\n\nBands of rain, sleet and snow, accompanied by strong winds will move in during Thursday, before gradually clearing Friday. Turning less cold by Saturday, with rain arriving later.\n\nMet Office chief meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nRead next:\n\nTributes paid as loved ones name victims of A48 crash that killed three\n\nWRU appoint familiar face in huge job to take charge of coaching in Wales\n\nntruders walk into house and attack man with baseball bat\n\nZachary Levi reveals Welsh roots as he says he loves Wales on The One Show",

While Northern Ireland will initially escape large accumulations of snow, 2cm could settle in some spots on Monday night, most likely over higher ground and over northern parts of Northern Ireland.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\nREAD MORE: The Met Office snow warnings in place across the UK - in full\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nCold weather alert\n\nIce will be an additional hazard for many through the week, with sub-zero temperatures creating some hazardous travel conditions. Temperatures could drop as low as -15\u00b0C overnight on Tuesday in some sheltered Scottish Glens, especially where there's fresh snow cover.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.''\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nSomerset butchers make shortlist for 'rural Oscars' gong The haunted tea room near Bath where a ghost was once spotted We tried the pies at the new Pieminister restaurant in Bath Much-loved deli in Midsomer Norton to close after 19 years Bath Southgate Zara store confirmed with big hint of opening date",

                    "body": "BRITS will be hit with snow TODAY as yet another cold snap sweeps across the UK.\n\nForecasters have placed much of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland under a snow and ice yellow weather warning for four days in a row.\n\nThe alert covers most of the southern England, including London and stretching up into the Midlands as far as Birmingham, as well as into Wales.\n\nMeanwhile, Scotland could even see up to 7 inches of snow in northern areas.\n\nAnd another white stuff warning covers the entirety of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Met Office warns: \"Ice and some snow leading to difficult travel conditions in places.\n\n\"Some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services. Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces.\n\n\"Probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\"\n\nThey say there is also a chance that rural communities could be cut off for several days.\n\nAnd people should be prepared for long interruptions to power supplies, gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage.\n\nThe UK will be covered in warnings until Friday - and the first snow is set to fall today.\n\nThe Met Office warns: \"A band of rain and sleet, with perhaps a little snow in places, will slowly clear from southern England.\n\n\"Sunny spells elsewhere but also snow and hail showers, these frequent and heavy across northern Scotland. Feeling cold for all.\"\n\nMet Office spokesperson Grahame Madge, said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\nHe continued: \"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nHe explained that conditions could be similar to those experience during the recent deep freeze in December.\n\nMr Madge went on: \"This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"",

                    "body": "Loganair is offering free flight changes amid a Met Office warning of snow and ice across large parts of the UK this week.\n\nThe Scottish regional carrier is abolishing flight amendment fees for travellers but plans to operate all scheduled services.\n\nThe airline said: \"Given the yellow warning for snow forecast on Thursday, 9th March until Friday, 10th March 2023, across the UK, and the potential for travel disruption, we are offering customers the opportunity to adjust travel plans without charge.\n\n\"You can choose to re-book on an alternative flight up to 7 days from your original travel date. There will be no change fee or difference in fare payable.\n\n\"If a seat is available on an alternative flight, you can transfer your booking to that flight without charge on a first-come, first-served basis.\"\n\nLoganair added: \"We plan to fly all our scheduled services. We have standby aircraft and crews in place to help recover any disrupted services as soon as possible once weather conditions permit.\n\n\"Please note that unless your flight is cancelled, no refund will be offered for any operating service.\"\n\nThe Met Office said many locations across Scotland could see between 2-4 inches of snow at the end of the week.\n\nThe heaviest snowfalls are expected on Friday with the Highlands, Aberdeenshire and central and southern Scotland covered by warnings.\n\nThe yellow alert for snow and ice extends from the north of Scotland, along the north east to much of the south of England today (Tuesday), including London, Birmingham and Cardiff with a warning of difficult travel conditions.\n\nThe warning runs until Friday covering different parts of the country and extending into Northern Ireland on Thursday and Friday.",

                    "body": "Britain is bracing for the coldest night of the year as the Met Office has issued weather warnings for snow and ice across the UK, with more areas on alert.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded so far this year is -10.4C in Scotland. However, the mercury could drop to -15C in some sheltered Scottish glens.\n\nThe Met Office has already issued a yellow warning for snow and ice, with more areas in the Midlands, much of Wales and the southeast, including London, under alert for snow on Tuesday morning as Arctic air sweeps across the country.\n\nThe area covered by the yellow warning is set to extend as far south as Hull before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nA similar warning covering much of Northern Ireland is also in place overnight.\n\nMet Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities this week, with the mercury plunging to -4C in London and -6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year,\" he said.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\"\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nSnow began falling in Northern Scotland on Monday afternoon, and more than 20cm of it could accumulate over high ground in Scotland, while more than 5cm is likely to accumulate at lower levels in the northeast of the UK.\n\nOver the week, more snow is expected, with many areas likely to see snow at some point. However, after an extremely cold Tuesday, conditions remain slightly uncertain for Wednesday when a \"battleground\" is expected to be set up as milder Atlantic air from the south meets colder Arctic air from the north.\n\nBut overall, there is fear that while the cold air sweeps the country, temperatures could drop almost six degrees below their coldest last March, when they reached -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.\n\nThe all-time low for the UK for March occurred in 1958, when the mercury dropped to -22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption was likely, and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual. People are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths, while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nAccording to the Met Office, there was a small possibility of rural communities becoming isolated, and there could be cut offs in power and phone services.\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, advised people to keep warm clothes and a torch in their car in case they get stuck in icy conditions.\n\n\"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England, which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, the agency's Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection, said people should check on vulnerable relatives and told pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C.",

                    "body": "A Met Office weather map has shown the huge swathes of heavy snow that are set to hit Leeds later this week as temperatures are set to plummet further.\n\nFrom tomorrow many areas of Northern England and the UK will experience freezing temperatures which are set to bring wintry showers and heavy snow with it. Officials from the Met Office have now issued an urgent heavy snow warning for Leeds and other parts of the UK too.\n\nThe yellow weather warning for snow warns that 'heavy snow' could hit the city from Thursday, March 9 onwards. The 39-hour warning runs from 3am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday, March 10.\n\nRead More:Met Office issues 39-hour snow warning for Leeds as 'significant disruption' expected\n\nIn a statement meteorologists from the Met Office said: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\n\"Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places.\n\n\"In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nBelow is a picture of the snowfall forecast at 12pm on Thursday.\n\nAccording to the Met Office map snow will start to fall in Leeds from 12pm on Thursday.\n\nAt that time the city could see anything from 0.5mm of snowfall up to 4mm of snowfall per hour. This is set to continue until 3pm and then get heavier.\n\nAt 3pm most areas of Leeds can expect to see up to 4mm of snow per hour. By 6pm the snow is expected to have cleared and instead turned to rain.\n\nRead next:\n\nLeeds landlord 'distraught' his family-of-five is being booted out of pub in a week\n\nBBC's Saving Lives in Leeds: Where it was filmed, start time and teaser\n\nFuming Leeds students 'miss out on jobs' after university runs out of paper and cannot print their graduation certificates\n\nMan jailed in Leeds for supplying firearms to organised crime groups\n\nGet breaking news by email by signing up to our newsletters",

                    "title": "Roads closed as Arctic blast brings snow, ice and plunging temperatures",
                    "body": "Roads have been closed in Scotland overnight as freezing Arctic air brought snow and ice sweeping in from the north. Yellow weather warnings have been issued for parts of the country, with the Met Office warning of \"difficult travel conditions\" this morning (March 7) with roads and railways likely to be affected. People should expect longer journey times.\n\nAmong the roads being reported as closed by the traffic monitoring website Inrix National in the early hours of this morning was the A93, which has been closed due to snow from School Road to the Spittal of Glenshee turn-off and the A939 between Tomintoul and Cock Bridge, also due to snow.\n\nThe Met Office has also issued a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday. Its first warning began on Sunday evening for parts of Scotland, covering places including Aberdeen and Dundee, the Highlands, Orkney and Shetland. The latest warning covers more of Scotland and a corridor of north-east England that extends to Newcastle upon Tyne and Yorkshire.\n\nFor today (March 7), the area extends to cover Strathclyde. Frequent snow is expected, with northern Scotland experiencing frequent and often heavy snow showers.\n\nThe Met Office said there was \"slight chance\" that rural communities could be cut off, adding that cuts to power and phone services were possible. It said that tonight could be the coldest of the year so far with lows of -15C in some sheltered Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snow cover.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year,\" said the Met Office. \"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said people should keep warm clothes and a torch in their car in case they get stuck in icy conditions.\n\nHe said: \"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\"\n\nJames Coles of Scottish Mountain Rescue and Team Leader at Moffat Mountain Rescue said: \"The UK is entering a period of increasingly challenging weather conditions with snow, ice and gusty winds all featuring prominently in the forecast for the coming week. Upland areas, especially in the mountains, can see conditions change very rapidly and they may be markedly different from surrounding lowland areas.\"\n\nREAD NEXT: 'Man with a van' and employee exposed as serial fly-tippers after waste dumped in Scots street Kate Forbes says Independent Scotland could be better off within a decade of leaving UK Devastated mum drove past crash site where daughter lay next to dead friends three times First picture of 'loved husband and dad' who died after explosion at Perth recycling centre Pensioner who died in horror Falkirk house fire named as woman remains in hospital\n\nFor more stories from where you live, visit InYourArea.",

                    "body": "Some parts of Britain have been hit by a blanket of snow as the freezing temperatures start to set in for the rest of the week.\n\nThe Met Office issued a number of yellow weather warnings covering the UK from Aberdeen to Cornwall, starting from Monday and expected to last until Friday.\n\nIt comes after warnings that the start of this month would see a cold snap similar to that felt in December last year, where Braemar in Aberdeenshire recorded -17.3C on December 13.\n\nAlthough temperatures are not expected to be as low as three months ago, it is widely expected to go below freezing over the course of the week with snow already hitting the north of the UK.\n\nWeather warnings for snow and ice are in place for much of the UK on Tuesday morning ( Image: Met Office)\n\nBraemar was one of the first places to be photographed with snowfall on Monday evening, while streets and gardens in Whitby and Newcastle were blanketed with snow in the early hours of Tuesday morning. It was also reported that there was light covering at Manchester Airport.\n\nYellow weather warnings are in place for northern Scotland in addition to the whole of Northern Ireland, the north-east of England and a large area covering the midlands, south Wales and London.\n\nThe Met Office's alerts warn of snow and ice which could cause travel disruption on both road and rail for commuters.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Alex Deakin said: \"There was the potential for more snow throughout this week. There's low pressure heading down through the North Sea and that has allowed the doors to open for Arctic air.\n\nHeavy snowfall is expected on Wednesday ( Image: WXCharts)\n\n\"That air is coming right down from the Arctic and that cold air is in place and will be for most of the week.\n\n\"We also have this weather front just trickling southwards and that us going to produce a mixture of rain, sleet and snow across parts of the south into Tuesday morning. And potentially things could get pretty icy as well.\"\n\nThe position of low pressure could decipher where snow will predominantly hit on Wednesday as the warm weather from the south comes in contact with the colder air from the north flank.\n\nThis could see the southern England get the brunt of the snow before moving northwards towards the tail end of the week.\n\nUK 5 day weather forecast\n\nThis Evening and Tonight:\n\nFurther heavy snow showers for parts of northern Scotland and northeast England, snow showers also spreading into Northern Ireland. Further south, outbreaks of rain, sleet and snow affect the southern half of the UK where some icy patches too.\n\nHeavy snow falls in Braemar, Aberdeenshire on Monday evening ( Image: @MetWatchUK/Twitter)\n\nTuesday:\n\nEarly rain and snow in the south slowly clearing, brighter weather following. Otherwise sunny intervals but also further snow showers, mainly in the north and far east. Feeling cold.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday:\n\nOccasional sleet and snow affecting southern England and south Wales on Wednesday; elsewhere mostly dry and cold. Potential for more widespread snow, rain and strong winds on Thursday and Friday.\n\nRead More Read More Read More Read More Read More",

                    "body": "Yellow warnings of snow and ice have been issued for large parts of the UK as forecasters warn that temperatures will plummet over the next 24 hours as Arctic air sweeps in from the north.\n\nThe Met Office has issued fresh alerts across areas of the Midlands, East, south of England, Wales and Northern Ireland following on from warnings for parts of Scotland and northern England. The new warnings came into force overnight and the Met Office says that heavy snow could bring \"significant disruption\" to northern and central parts of the country on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe Met Office's yellow warnings cover much of the UK for the next five days with forecasters saying a \"major change\" is under way as Arctic air sweeps in from the north. Motorists and pedestrians are being warned of \"difficult travel conditions\" this morning (March 7) with roads and railways likely to be affected. People should expect longer journey times.\n\nThe snow is likely to cause some travel disruption across parts of southern England and Wales throughout Wednesday, according to another warning. South West England and South Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday and a few centimetres of snow could fall in those areas. North England, North Wales, most of Scotland and Northern Ireland will be covered by a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday.\n\nThe first Met Office warning began on Sunday evening for parts of Scotland, covering places including Aberdeen and Dundee, the Highlands, Orkney and Shetland. The warning put in place yesterday covers more of Scotland and a corridor of north-east England that extends to Newcastle upon Tyne and Yorkshire.\n\nFor today (March 7), the area extends to cover Strathclyde, more of Yorkshire and the Humber, and the East Midlands. Frequent snow is expected, with northern Scotland experiencing frequent and often heavy snow showers.\n\nThe Met Office said there was \"slight chance\" that rural communities could be cut off, adding that cuts to power and phone services were possible. It said that tonight could be the coldest of the year so far with lows of -15C in some sheltered Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snow cover. Colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week - with -4C in London and -6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year,\" said the Met Office. \"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said people should keep warm clothes and a torch in their car in case they get stuck in icy conditions.\n\nHe said: \"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days. The agency's Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection, Dr Agostinho Sousa, said people should check on vulnerable relatives and told pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C.\n\nFor more stories from where you live, visit InYourArea.",

                    "body": "Tuesday night could be the coldest of the year so far, the Met Office has warned, with temperatures set to drop as low as -15C (5F).\n\nIt would beat the current lowest temperature of -10.4C (13.3F), recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of 19 January.\n\nThe lowest temperatures on Tuesday are expected to be in sheltered Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snow cover.\n\nIt comes as the Met Office - and the UK's Health Security Agency (UKHSA) - issued warnings for snow and ice for large parts of England, Scotland, Wales and, Northern Ireland, this week.\n\nArctic air is sweeping across due to a \"highly amplified\" jet stream, mixed with an area of lower pressure over the Mid-North Atlantic, which is pushing air up into northern areas and back down towards the UK.\n\nUK weather: The latest Sky News forecast\n\nA yellow warning is in place for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and South Wales from 9pm on Monday night until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time.\n\nAnother yellow warning is in place for much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England and is set to remain in place until 10am on Wednesday.\n\nSouth West England and South Wales will be covered by another yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday, and a few centimetres of snow could fall in those areas.\n\n'Much colder than we would expect'\n\nNorth England, North Wales, most of Scotland and Northern Ireland will also be covered by a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures would be \"much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year\".\n\nHe said: \"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual. Some rural areas could also become cut off from the national power grid.\n\nUKHSA has issued a level three cold weather alert for the whole of England, which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nThe agency's head of extreme events and health protection, Dr Agostinho Sousa, said people should check on vulnerable relatives and told pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C (64F).",

Northern Ireland is also tipped for the same weather warning\n\nAnother yellow weather warning has been earmarked for a large stretch covering parts of southern England, London, the midlands and south Wales\n\nBRAEMAR: Snow fell on the A93 today as parts of Scotland are under a yellow weather warning for snow and ice\n\nMORAY: Fresh snow covered parts of Scotland, including near the Lecht ski centre in Moray, today as the Met Office warned of more snow and ice for the next two days\n\nBALLATER: Skiers and snowboarders take advantage of the snowfall at Glenshee ski centre today as parts of Scotland are under a yellow met warning for snow and ice\n\nSTRATHDON: An HGV struggles up the snow covered A939 at The Lecht today\n\nHeavy snow showers are expected in parts of northern Scotland, northeast England and parts of Northern Ireland tonight, The Met Office says. With weather further south consisting of outbreaks of rain, sleet and snow.\n\nIt comes as a cold weather alert was issued as the Home Office warns that sub-zero temperatures could pose a severe risk to vulnerable individuals.\n\nThe Met Office has extended its yellow weather warning for snow and ice to include much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland today as Britain shivers through the coldest day of the year.\n\nWarnings are in place across the country for ice and snow until Friday. The south is more likely to see snowfall on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nUp to 4 inches of snow will fall across northern England and Scotland today. It will bring the threat of sleet and snow in the Midlands and southern England later in the week.\n\nThe forecasting body said temperatures in parts of the UK will drop below freezing tonight and will not top mid-single figures during tomorrow or Wednesday.\n\nA warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England. The area covered by it is set to extend as far south as Hull from tomorrow before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nGrahame Madge, of the Met Office, said: 'We are about to enter a particularly eventful period of weather. Freezing conditions, coupled with heavy snow and drifting all mean that people's travel plans will have to be urgently reviewed. These risks will only increase as we go through the week.\n\n'I advise people to stay in touch with the forecast and be prepared to cancel travel plans accordingly. The warning is suggesting as much as 16 inches of snow, but with winds whipping it into blizzards, accumulations greater than that are possible.'\n\nFrom Thursday into Friday, as much as 30-40cm (12-16in) could be dumped on higher parts of the Central Belt, the Southern Uplands and southern Highlands. This could affect roads including the A1, the M74 and the M8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nRail journeys are also likely to be affected and airports may find it impossible to keep runways clear of snow.\n\nEven colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week with the mercury plunging to -4C in London and -6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\nForecasters say temperatures are likely to stay far below average for early spring for much of the week. Below freezing temperatures are predicted to continue until March 11 at least amid a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event.\n\nTUESDAY: Yellow weather warnings have been issued for much of southern England, including the capital, on Monday\n\nWEDNESDAY: Snow and ice will continue to plague parts of the country on Wednesday as the Met Office issues weather warnings for much of the South West\n\nYellow weather warnings have also been issued by the Met Office for Thursday and Friday and there is a potential for travel disruption\n\nCORGARFF: Cars got stuck in drifting snow along the A939 today near Corgarff, Scotland\n\nNORTH YORKSHIRE: A light dusting of snow covered the Tan Hill Inn this morning. Britain will shiver through the coldest day of the year today with snow and ice set to freeze swathes of northern England and Scotland\n\nSHETLAND: A view of the snowfall in Shetland this morning. Forecasters say high ground areas of northern Scotland can expect the most snowfall, possibly reaching depths of four inches\n\nSHETLAND: Snow is seen in the northernmost region of the United Kingdom this morning\n\nLONDON: People walking around London Bridge in the rain and freezing temperatures this morning\n\nMr Madge said conditions could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\nHe said: 'Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n'The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n'We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.'\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nThe risk of snow further south into England will grow from tomorrow. It might only start feeling milder in southern England from Friday but areas further north could stay chilly into next week.\n\nMet Office forecaster Craig Snell said the air was 'coming pretty much straight from the Arctic, which is especially cold at this time of year'.\n\nHe added: 'I would imagine you will see some sleet or snow in the South of England, even if it doesn't cause any great disruption.\n\n'But we are keeping a close eye on it.'\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed North East England, North West England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nTYNE AND WEAR: Daredevils thought nothing of the icy temperatures today as they dodged 20 foot high waves on Whitley Bay's Lower South Promenade\n\nTYNE AND WEAR: Huge waves crashed over the promenade at Whitley Bay this morning as walkers and fishermen could be seen running from the crashing waves\n\nTYNE AND WEAR: Waves at Whitley Bay crashed over and splashed onlookers\n\nNORTH YORKSHIRE: The yellow weather warning, which started at 6pm yesterday, extends to Wednesday.

The UK is bracing for more bad weather in the coming days\n\nDaredevils brave icy temperatures to play in huge waves on promenade\n\nDaredevils thought nothing of the icy temperatures today as they played and dodged in 20 foot high waves on Whitley Bay's Lower South Promenade.\n\nThe thrill-seekers were clearly having the time of their lives, as the waves crashed over the man made structure and splashed their group.\n\n'They were having a daft laugh, it was really funny to watch. Most of them got wet,' said photographer Gren Sowerby, from Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, who captured the action.\n\n'It was bitterly cold but really good fun, I wouldn't want to have been on that promenade.'\n\nThe Met Office has issued snow warnings for this week, as northerly airflow is set to bring disruptive weather.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: 'This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n'Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.'\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has urged people to look out for those most at risk from cold weather such as those with medical conditions or aged over 65.\n\nBritons are encouraged to ensure vulnerable residents have access to warm food and drinks and are managing to heat their homes adequately.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa from the UKHSA advised: 'During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n'If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.'\n\nExperts also advise avoiding exposure to cold or icy outdoor conditions if you are at a higher risk of cold-related illness or falls.\n\nSHETLAND: Snow-covered homes and yards on Shetland this morning. Some residents reported school closures and cancellations to school bus routes\n\nMORAY: Cars are seen driving along the snow-covered A939 this morning near the Lecht Ski Centre in Moray, Scotland\n\nMORAY: Snow is seen along the A939 this morning.

Commuters are pictured in the rain and freezing temperatures this morning\n\nSHETLAND: Snow fell on the beach on Shetland, Scotland, this morning\n\nThe plunging temperatures are the latest cold snap to hit the UK as it battles with soaring energy bills during the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe UKHSA said for those struggling with the rising costs, it provides free advice on energy efficiency and national grants to help warm homes.\n\nIt advised that wearing several layers of thinner clothing will keep people warmer than wearing one thick layer, and that consuming hot food and drinks is also effective.\n\nLast night National Grid ESO put out a notification that they 'will warm one of our five winter contingency coal units for potential use on Tuesday 7 March.'\n\nWhile it was not confirmation that it would be used, it meant it would be available 'if required' as ESO is a 'prudent system operator'.\n\nIt comes after provisional Met Office figures also showed that England had its driest February in 30 years.\n\nThe United Kingdom as a whole had less than half the monthly average rainfall, at 45 per cent, with 43.4mm falling.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, while on March 14, 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low of -22.8C at Logie Coldstone in the same region.",

Wednesday will see temperatures ease during the day, with no warning in place for Northern Ireland, but the cold will return overnight.\n\nFor Thursday and Friday, the yellow warning is for snow, with the Met Office suggesting parts of Northern Ireland, along with northern England and north Wales, are \"expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday\".\n\nAffected locations could see snow of up to 20cm in the worst hit areas, meteorologists have said, while further warnings are \"very likely\" in the days ahead.\n\nThe yellow warning means that on Thursday, \"there is a slight chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers\".\n\nIt has also been suggested that the cold weather could lead to travel delays and cancellations, while in the worst-hit areas there is a risk of interruptions to services including power supplies.\n\nMeanwhile, the icy weather is occurring as ongoing industrial action by Department for Infrastructure roads service staff continues.\n\nThe department said strikes over pay by union members could see the gritting of roads disrupted.\n\nThe Met Office has said the spring cold snap was the result of an \"Arctic maritime airmass\" passing over the UK and Ireland that could see temperatures in NI drop to as low as -6 degrees.\n\nIts deputy chief meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall. With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Met \u00c9ireann has issued a yellow warning for the whole of Ireland for Tuesday, after the cold snap began on Monday evening.\n\nIt has warned that \"snow showers and icy patches are likely to cause some travel disruption\".",

Nothern Ireland is also tipped for the same weather warning\n\nAnother yellow weather warning has been earmarked for a large stretch covering parts of southern England, London, the midlands and south Wales\n\nVentusky Privacy Policy\n\nBRAEMAR: Snow fell on the A93 today as parts of Scotland are under a yellow weather warning for snow and ice\n\nMORAY: Fresh snow covered parts of Scotland, including near the Lecht ski centre in Moray, today as the Met Office warned of more snow and ice for the next two days\n\nBALLATER: Skiers and snowboarders take advantage of the snowfall at Glenshee ski centre today as parts of Scotland are under a yellow met warning for snow and ice\n\nSTRATHDON: An HGV struggles up the snow covered A939 at The Lecht today\n\nIt comes as a cold weather alert was issued as the Home Office warns that sub-zero temperatures could pose a severe risk to vulnerable individuals.\n\nThe Met Office has extended its yellow weather warning for snow and ice to include much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland today as Britain shivers through the coldest day of the year.\n\nWarnings are in place across the country for ice and snow until Friday. The south is more likely to see snowfall on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nUp to 4 inches of snow will fall across northern England and Scotland today. It will bring the threat of sleet and snow in the Midlands and southern England later in the week.\n\nThe forecasting body said temperatures in parts of the UK will drop below freezing tonight and will not top mid-single figures during tomorrow or Wednesday.\n\nA warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England. The area covered by it is set to extend as far south as Hull from tomorrow before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to -1C in Manchester and 2C in London tonight.\n\nEven colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week with the mercury plunging to -4C in London and -6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\nForecasters say temperatures are likely to stay far below average for early spring for much of the week. Below freezing temperatures are predicted to continue until March 11 at least amid a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event.\n\nTUESDAY: Yellow weather warnings have been issued for much of southern England, including the capital, on Monday\n\nWEDNESDAY: Snow and ice will continue to plague parts of the country on Wednesday as the Met Office issues weather warnings for much of the South West\n\nYellow weather warnings have also been issued by the Met Office for Thursday and Friday and there is a potential for travel disruption\n\nCORGARFF: Cars got stuck in drifting snow along the A939 today near Corgarff, Scotland\n\nNORTH YORKSHIRE: A light dusting of snow covered the Tan Hill Inn this morning.

We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n'We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.'\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nThe risk of snow further south into England will grow from tomorrow. It might only start feeling milder in southern England from Friday but areas further north could stay chilly into next week.\n\nMet Office forecaster Craig Snell said the air was 'coming pretty much straight from the Arctic, which is especially cold at this time of year'.\n\nHe added: 'I would imagine you will see some sleet or snow in the South of England, even if it doesn't cause any great disruption.\n\n'But we are keeping a close eye on it.'\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed North East England, North West England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nTYNE AND WEAR: Daredevils thought nothing of the icy temperatures today as they dodged 20 foot high waves on Whitley Bay's Lower South Promenade\n\nTYNE AND WEAR: Huge waves crashed over the promenade at Whitley Bay this morning as walkers and fishermen could be seen running from the crashing waves\n\nTYNE AND WEAR: Waves at Whitley Bay crashed over and splashed onlookers\n\nNORTH YORKSHIRE: The yellow weather warning, which started at 6pm yesterday, extends to Wednesday.

Most of them got wet,' said photographer Gren Sowerby, from Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, who captured the action.\n\n'It was bitterly cold but really good fun, I wouldn't want to have been on that promenade.'\n\nThe Met Office has issued snow warnings for this week, as northerly airflow is set to bring disruptive weather.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: 'This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n'Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.'\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has urged people to look out for those most at risk from cold weather such as those with medical conditions or aged over 65.\n\nBritons are encouraged to ensure vulnerable residents have access to warm food and drinks and are managing to heat their homes adequately.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa from the UKHSA advised: 'During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n'If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.'\n\nExperts also advise avoiding exposure to cold or icy outdoor conditions if you are at a higher risk of cold-related illness or falls.\n\nSHETLAND: Snow-covered homes and yards on Shetland this morning. Some residents reported school closures and cancellations to school bus routes\n\nMORAY: Cars are seen driving along the snow-covered A939 this morning near the Lecht Ski Centre in Moray, Scotland\n\nMORAY: Snow is seen along the A939 this morning.

London Bridge is pictured this morning\n\nLONDON: Commuters around London Bridge this morning as cold weather has hit the capital\n\nLONDON: Parts of England could also be in for cold and snowy weather this week. Commuters are pictured in the rain and freezing temperatures this morning\n\nSHETLAND: Snow fell on the beach on Shetland, Scotland, this morning\n\nThe plunging temperatures are the latest cold snap to hit the UK as it battles with soaring energy bills during the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe UKHSA said for those struggling with the rising costs, it provides free advice on energy efficiency and national grants to help warm homes.\n\nIt advised that wearing several layers of thinner clothing will keep people warmer than wearing one thick layer, and that consuming hot food and drinks is also effective.\n\nIt comes after provisional Met Office figures also showed that England had its driest February in 30 years.\n\nThe United Kingdom as a whole had less than half the monthly average rainfall, at 45 per cent, with 43.4mm falling.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, while on March 14, 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low of -22.8C at Logie Coldstone in the same region.",

Snow could develop quite widely across Merseyside as a potentially deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\nThe Met Office has put the yellow weather warning in place from 3am on Thursday, March 9 until 6pm on Friday, March 10.\n\nREAD MORE: Mum couldn't afford to shop in Primark until 'absolute heroes' came to aid\n\nIn a statement, they said: \"Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring five to 10cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area.\n\n\"Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40cm of snow in places. In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nThe Met Office says people must expect a small chance of long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel, roads becoming blocked by deep snow, communities cut off for several days and long interruptions to power supplies and other services, such as gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage.\n\nReceive newsletters with the latest news, sport and what's on updates from the Liverpool ECHO by signing up here\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nLive court updates as Thomas Cashman trial over Olivia Pratt-Korbel murder begins\n\nBoy arrested after crashing into Liverpool players in Manchester United drubbing\n\nThree people found dead after five went missing following night out in Wales\n\nLive updates as police close Speke Boulevard after bin lorry crash\n\nMango shoppers praise \u00a370 'Chanel inspired' blazer that's 'beautiful and stylish'",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe Met Office has warned UK residents to brace themselves for snow and plunging temperatures this week.\n\nForecasters have explained that a major change in climate is underway, as Arctic air moves in from the north, bringing snow, ice and freezing temperatures for many.\n\nExperts believe the sudden drop in temperature is being caused by sudden stratospheric warming and could bring about similar freezing conditions to the Beast from the East in 2018.\n\nWarnings for snow and ice have been issued across northeastern parts of the UK as well as some Northern Ireland and southern and central areas of England and Wales.\n\nFurther warnings are likely to be issued throughout the week.\n\nUp to 30cm of snow is expected to fall in isolated spots across Scotland and more than 20cm of snow could build up over high ground. Patchy snow of 1 to 2cm is forecast for much of Wales and parts of central, southern and eastern England.\n\nIcy roads will be an additional hazard throughout the week, with sub-zero temperatures creating difficult conditions and bringing severe disruptions.\n\nThe mercury could drop as low as -15C overnight on Tuesday in some sheltered Scottish Glens, especially where there's fresh snow cover.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nDuring Tuesday night and early Wednesday - the south of England is at a much greater risk of snowfall as mild air moves in from the southwest and clashes with cold air.\n\nThe risk of snow gradually spreads further north towards the latter half of the week.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"The impactful weather will continue through the second half of the week as mild air meets cold air with further snow, ice, wind and then rain likely later in the week and into the weekend.\n\n\"From Wednesday, the focus of further snow is across parts of southern England and south Wales, with snow likely to lower levels for a time, and many may wake up to a couple of centimetres of snow on Wednesday morning.\"",

It comes as temperatures continue to drop across the region.\n\nAnd snow could hit anytime with flurries predicted in parts of Birmingham, Shropshire, Worcestershire and the Black Country from Monday, March 6 to Thursday, March 9. With that in mind, the Met Office has issued advice to the public on how to prepare for the adverse weather.\n\nThis includes important information for homeowners. The Met Office have said that homes should ideally be kept at 18 degrees celsius.\n\nREAD MORE: Met Office issues snow and ice warning for Birmingham and Midlands and shares exact hours it'll hit\n\nThis is particularly important for elderly residents, they added. The advice comes as energy bills continue to rise across the country.\n\nBut the move is reportedly important for maintaining good health. A spokesperson for the Met Office said: \"Ideally you should heat your home to a temperature of at least 18 \u00b0C.\n\n\"This is particularly important if you have reduced mobility, are 65 or over, or have a health condition, such as heart or lung disease. Having room temperatures slightly over 18 \u00b0C could be good for your health.\n\n\"If you are under the age of 65, active and wearing appropriate clothing, you may wish to keep your home at a comfortable temperature even if it is slightly lower than 18\u00b0C.\"\n\nThey continued: \"Overnight, people who are 65 and over or who have pre-existing health conditions may find bedroom temperatures of at least 18 \u00b0C are good for their health; this may be less important if you are a healthy adult under 65 and have appropriate clothing and bedding.\n\n\"It is important to keep your bedroom window closed at night when the weather is cold.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nWalsall boy, 7, 'helps land planes at Birmingham Airport' after dad pens moving letter Wombourne is the village everyone is 'lusting' after - but hardly anyone can move to We visited the 'happiest place' in the West Midlands and everyone said the same thing We visited the 'unhappiest place' in the West Midlands where people are angry over '\u00a35 shops' Stay abreast with the very latest from the region with our Black Country Email Updates",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued more yellow weather warnings for snow and ice, with millions of Brits set to experience an Arctic blast this week.\n\nAn initial warning was issued on Friday (March 3) and covered much of Scotland as well as the north-east coast of England.\n\nEarlier today (Monday, March 6) two more were issued, covering Northern Ireland and large swathes of both Wales and England.\n\nREAD MORE: UK weather maps show when Brits will be blanketed with up to 10cm of snow today\n\nLondon, Cardiff, Belfast, Birmingham, Oxford, Leicester and Norwich are just some of the cities impacted.\n\nThe Met Office said: \"Some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services.\n\n\"Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces.\n\n\"Probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\"\n\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Met Office said 2cm of snow can be expected to settle on the ground.\n\nThe earlier alert for Scotland warned of up to 10cm in northern regions.\n\nToday's new warnings both expire at 10am tomorrow (Tuesday, March 7) but another is due to come into place on Wednesday (March 8) covering south Wales and much of the south-east of England.\n\nThere, the Met Office say 10cm of snow could settle on the ground over hills.\n\nAnother yellow-level warning for snow is to come on Thursday (March 9), lasting until 6pm on Friday (March 10).\n\nIt covers Northern Ireland, most of Scotland and the whole of the north of England and Wales.\n\nStaggeringly, the Met Office say some northern regions could see 20cm settle on the ground towards the end of the week. Up to 40cm of the white stuff is expected in the Highlands, the warning adds.\n\nPeople have been told: \"There is a small chance that long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel could occur.\n\n\"There is a slight chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers.\n\n\"There is a small chance that communities could be cut off for several days.\n\n\"There is a small chance that long interruptions to power supplies and other services, such as gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage, may occur.\"\n\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking here.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nMet Office urgent snow warning as arctic blast batters Brits with sub zero temperatures\n\nMet Office's major snow update with 'Arctic polar vortex' set to blast Britain\n\nBritain faces -11C Nordic snowstorm that threatens to keep nation on ice until April",

                    "body": "Tuesday night could be the coldest of the year so far, the Met Office has announced, as it issued weather warnings for snow and ice across the UK. The forecasting body said the mercury could drop to minus 15C in some sheltered Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snow cover.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year is minus 10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of January 19. Temperatures are set to drop almost six degrees below their coldest last March, when they reached minus 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.\n\nWeather warnings for snow and ice are in place across all four nations of the UK and more are expected to be issued as Arctic air sweeps across the country. A yellow weather warning for snow and ice will be in place for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and South Wales from 9pm on Monday night until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time. A yellow weather warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England.\n\nThe area covered by it is set to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday. South West England and South Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday and a few centimetres of snow could fall in those areas.\n\nNorth England, North Wales, most of Scotland and Northern Ireland will be covered by a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday. Snow drifts could occur on Friday, the Met Office said.\n\nSnow began falling in Northern Scotland on Monday afternoon. More than 20cm of it could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than 5cm is likely to accumulate at lower levels in the north-east of the UK.\n\nSubscribe here for the latest news where you live\n\nNorthern Ireland will initially escape large accumulations of snow but 2cm could settle in some spots on Monday night, most likely over higher ground and northern parts of the six counties. The Met Office said snow will move from the south to the north of the UK as mild air from the south-west meets cold air.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to minus 1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night. Even colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week - with the mercury plunging to minus 4C in London and minus 6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year. The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual. People are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said people should keep warm clothes and a torch in their car in case they get stuck in icy conditions. He said: \"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days. The agency's Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection Dr Agostinho Sousa said people should check on vulnerable relatives and told pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C.\n\nOn March 14, 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low for the month of minus 22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

                    "body": "People on the lowest incomes in North Yorkshire could receive a cash boost from cold weather conditions after the Met Office issued yellow weather warnings for snow throughout the week.\n\nThose who qualify will receive a payment if the average temperature in the area you live in is recorded or forecasted as 0C or below over one week.\n\nResidents will get \u00a325 for each seven-day period of very cold weather until March 31.\n\nYou could also be eligible if you have young children living with you.\n\nThe cold weather payments are only paid in England and Wales.\n\nDWP said cold weather payments have previously been triggered towards the end of last year in areas across the North West, including in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, in parts of the South West, such as near Exeter, and in Nottingham in the East Midlands, among others.\n\nParts of Powys in east-central Wales, Oxfordshire and Herefordshire, also had affected postcodes.\n\nThe yellow weather warning was originally put in place for Monday (March 6) and Tuesday (March 7) but is now expected to last until the end of the week.\n\nIt means there is likely to be disruption in the region due to heavy snow, as frequent snow showers are expected to continue on Thursday (March 9) and Friday (March 10).\n\nIt follows on from an announcement earlier this morning when the alert was previously extended to Wednesday (March 8).\n\nSnow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\nParts of Northern Ireland, North Wales and Northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and Northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\nEvent totals could bring 5-10cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15-20cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area.",

                    "body": "The forecasting body said the mercury could drop to minus 15C in some sheltered Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snow cover.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year is minus 10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of January 19.\n\nTemperatures are set to drop almost six degrees below their coldest last March, when they reached minus 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.\n\nWeather warnings for snow and ice are in place across all four nations of the UK and more are expected to be issued as Arctic air sweeps across the country.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice will be in place for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and South Wales from 9pm on Monday night until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England.\n\nThe area covered by it is set to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nSouth West England and South Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday and a few centimetres of snow could fall in those areas.\n\nNorth England, North Wales, most of Scotland and Northern Ireland will be covered by a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday.\n\nSnow drifts could occur on Friday, the Met Office said.\n\nSnow began falling in Northern Scotland on Monday afternoon. More than 20cm of it could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than 5cm is likely to accumulate at lower levels in the north-east of the UK.\n\nNorthern Ireland will initially escape large accumulations of snow but 2cm could settle in some spots on Monday night, most likely over higher ground and northern parts of the six counties.\n\nThe Met Office said snow will move from the south to the north of the UK as mild air from the south-west meets cold air.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to minus 1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night.\n\nEven colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week - with the mercury plunging to minus 4C in London and minus 6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said people should keep warm clothes and a torch in their car in case they get stuck in icy conditions.\n\nHe said: \"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nThe agency's Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection Dr Agostinho Sousa said people should check on vulnerable relatives and told pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C.\n\nOn March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low for the month of minus 22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

[[success]] Email address Sign up\n\nA second weather warning for snow has been issued for Tayside and Fife this week.\n\nThe yellow alert will come into force in the early hours of Thursday morning and is due to last until Friday evening.\n\nMet Office forecasters have warned of potential travel chaos, blocked roads and public transport cancellations.\n\nIt comes after the region was warned to expect snow and ice between Monday and Wednesday.\n\nThe latest weather alert covers most of Scotland - including Dundee, Angus, Perthshire and Fife - as well as Northern Ireland and parts of England.\n\nIt is predicted that parts of Scotland will see the heaviest snowfall on Friday.\n\nThe Met Office says it is possible some communities could be cut off for several days.\n\nPower supplies and services such as gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage could also be interrupted.\n\nAround 5 to 10cm of snow is expected in many locations, with potentially 15 to 20cm across the northern portion of the warning area.\n\nThere is also potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\n\nCheck transport route ahead of journey\n\nStein Connelly, head of transport resilience at Transport Scotland, urged people to check their route.\n\nHe said: \"We would urge the public to plan ahead, listen to Police Scotland travel advice, drive to the conditions, and also check before they travel.\n\n\"While our operating companies will be undertaking patrols and treatments and we are closely monitoring the network for impacts, it's important to recognise that challenging conditions are likely early next week.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

                    "body": "Tuesday night could be the coldest of the year so far, the Met Office has announced, as it issued weather warnings for snow and ice across the UK.\n\nThe forecasting body said the mercury could drop to minus 15C in some sheltered Scottish glens, especially where there is fresh snow cover.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year is minus 10.4C, which was recorded at Drumnadrochit near Inverness in the Highlands in the early hours of January 19.\n\nTemperatures are set to drop almost six degrees below their coldest last March, when they reached minus 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.\n\nWeather warnings for snow and ice are in place across all four nations of the UK and more are expected to be issued as Arctic air sweeps across the country.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England.\n\nThe area covered by it is set to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nSouth West England and South Wales will be covered by a yellow warning for snow all day on Wednesday and a few centimetres of snow could fall in those areas.\n\nNorth England, North Wales, most of Scotland and Northern Ireland will be covered by a yellow warning for snow between 3am on Thursday and 6pm on Friday.\n\nSnow drifts could occur on Friday, the Met Office said.\n\nSnow began falling in Northern Scotland on Monday afternoon. More than 20cm of it could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than 5cm is likely to accumulate at lower levels in the north-east of the UK.\n\nThe Met Office said snow will move from the south to the north of the UK as mild air from the south-west meets cold air.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to minus 1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night.\n\nEven colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week - with the mercury plunging to minus 4C in London and minus 6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said people should keep warm clothes and a torch in their car in case they get stuck in icy conditions.\n\nHe said: \"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice. Take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a level-three cold weather alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nThe agency's Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection Dr Agostinho Sousa said people should check on vulnerable relatives and told pensioners and anyone with an underlying health condition to heat their home to at least 18C.\n\nOn March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low for the month of minus 22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe Met Office has warned UK residents to brace themselves for an unexpected snowfall to hit within the week.\n\nThe weather experts have explained that a major change in climate is underway, as cold Arctic air moves in from the North, bringing snow, ice and low temperatures for many.\n\nExperts believe this sudden drop in temperature is being caused by sudden stratospheric warming and could bring about similar freezing conditions to the Beast from the East, in 2018.\n\nWarnings for snow and ice have been issued across Northeastern parts of the UK as well as some Northern Ireland and Southern and Central areas of England and Wales.\n\nFurther warnings are likely to be issued throughout the week.\n\nUp to 30cm of snow is expected to fall in isolated spots across Scotland and an excess of 20cm of snow could build up over high ground. Patchy snow of 1 to 2cm could build up over much of Wales and parts of Central, Southern and Eastern England.\n\nIcy roads will be an additional hazard throughout the week, with sub-zero temperatures creating hazardous travel conditions and severe disruptions.\n\nThe mercury could drop as low as -15\u00b0C overnight on Tuesday in some sheltered Scottish Glens, especially where there's fresh snow cover.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nDuring Tuesday night and early Wednesday - the South of England is at a much greater risk of snowfall as mild air gradually moves in from the Southwest, but brings with it snow as it meets the cold air.\n\nThis risk of snow gradually spreads further North through the latter half of the week. Further warnings have been issued.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"The impactful weather will continue through the second half of the week as mild air meets cold air with further snow, ice, wind and then rain likely later in the week and into the weekend.\n\n\"From Wednesday, the focus of further snow is across parts of southern England and south Wales, with snow likely to lower levels for a time, and many may wake up to a couple of centimetres of snow on Wednesday morning.\"",

                    "body": "IRELAND is bracing for a five-day cold blast - with the first snow set to fall within hours.\n\nTemperatures will plunge to -5C during the Baltic snap, with a nationwide ice warning kicking in from 6pm.\n\nMet Eireann predict potential snow in southern and northern areas from Monday night, when the mercury will dip to -4C.\n\nAnd it will continue \"very cold overnight through the week with frost, ice and some possible wintry falls\", forecasters warn.\n\nTuesday night looks set to be coldest, when temperatures drop to -5C.\n\nMet Eireann's current forecast states: \"Another icy cold night with a widespread sharp or severe frost as temperatures fall to between -5C and 0C.\n\n\"Mostly dry and clear over the northern half of the country, with wintry falls of rain sleet or snow in parts of the south.\"\n\nWednesday will start cold but rain or sleet could strike across the southern half of the country throughout the day with wintry outbreaks set to continue feed up from the southwest during the night.\n\nAnd snow or wintry showers will persist on Thursday but the snow will turn to a mix of sleet and rain as the day goes on.\n\nExperts warn there's still \"considerable uncertainty\" for Friday, but rain over the south could then turn to sleet or snow over the north.\n\nThe nationwide ice warning is due to remain in place until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nMet Eireann warned: \"Hazardous conditions due to freezing temperatures including icy stretches on roads and paths. Sleet or snow flurries in Munster overnight.\"\n\nBut there's plenty you can do to be prepared for the first major snowfall of the season - here's what you can tick off your list.\n\n1. Have a small supply of food and keep supplies of essential medication: Stock up on foodstuffs that won't go off and keep extra medication in case you won't be able to get to the chemist.\n\n2. Have an adequate supply of fuel for heating and cooking: Don't be left stuck - grab a few supplies now and Winter Ready also recommends a suitable alternative in case the main supply fails.\n\n3. Gather the essentials: Have a shovel and bag of salt to keep paths clear and safe, and have batteries for torches, plus candles and matches in the event of power cuts.\n\n4. Check on neighbours: Plenty of us know people in our locality who may not be able to get out and about as much - so give a quick call to check they're aware of weather warnings and that they are not stuck for supplies.\n\nCheck they have enough fuel for heating and food to keep them going. If you have any doubts about the safety of an elderly or infirm person seek the assistance of gardai or local social services.\n\n5. Have emergency and useful numbers handy: The usual emergency numbers are familiar to all of us - but keep your local Councillors' details and a contact for companies like ESB close at hand.\n\n6. Bring your pets inside: These weather conditions are not exactly ideal for your dogs and cats to be outside in - so make sure you bring them in to keep out of the snow.\n\n7. Bleed radiators and take measures to prevent pipes freezing: Bleed your radiators to allow trapped air - which can cause radiators to have cold spots - escape.\n\nThis results in a warmer home and cheaper energy bills. You can apply lagging to your pipes using electrical heating tape.\n\nThis can be applied directly to the pipe and can be picked up in any decent hardware store.\n\nAdd extra insulation - especially to pipes in areas that are not property insulated such as attics or basements.\n\nRepair any leaks at taps or valves and know how to turn off the water supply - usually under the kitchen sink.\n\nThe Government's Winter Ready advice states:\n\nCheck that loft insulation is thick and in good condition. Fit your water tank with an insulation jacket or alternatively, wrap the top and sides with suitable insulation material. Other useful steps include:\n\n8. Make the outside of your home 'winter-proof': Check for loose or missing shingles on your roof.\n\nGive your gutters a good clean by removing any leaves, sticks, dirt or debris that could block the flow of rain or melting snow and ice.\n\nEnsure any vents and your chimney are clear of anything that could block the exhaust.\n\n9. Care for your car: Before setting off on any journey, make sure you can tick all of these boxes.\n\n10. Check your travel plans and drive with caution: The following advice has been issued by Winter Ready to ensure safety on our roads during the snow.\n\n11. Charge your phone now: Again, just in case of a power cut, plug in your phone now to make sure you'll have enough charge to get through any eventualities.\n\n12. Take care as a pedestrian: if a journey cannot be avoided, wear sturdy footwear with good gripping soles.\n\nTake an extra look before you cross the road and do not attempt to cross the road if there are vehicles around - remember snow and ice increase the distance that cars need to stop.\n\nVisibility is reduced in snowy condition so wear high visibility clothing or carry a torch.\n\n13. Leave a key and contact details with neighbours or family if you are going away: Make sure to prepare by dropping off a spare key to neighbours who may need access.",

                    "body": "A map reveals the overnight temperatures forecast for some cities and towns across the country as the UK braces for another cold snap and snow.\n\nGlasgow is forecast to be one of the coldest urban centres early on Tuesday morning, although forecasters say the mecury could plunge to as low as -10C in the Scottish glens.\n\nAberdeen, Belfast, Newcastle, Manchester and Hull also look set to experience sub-zero conditions and the Met Office has issued weather warnings for snow and ice covering parts of England, Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nIt will be marginally warmer in southern England and the Midlands, with 0C forecast for Birningham and 3C in Southampton.\n\nTemperatures in London will also hover slightly above freezing, with lows of 2C expected in the capital.\n\nUp to 30cm of snow could fall in isolated spots across Scotland while other areas could see 10-20cm of snow fall.\n\nA yellow weather warning will be in place for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and South Wales from 9pm on Monday night until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of northern and eastern Scotland and North East England.\n\nThe area covered by it is set to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could go even colder later in the week.\n\nThe mercury could plunge to -4C in London and -6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\nMr Madge said conditions could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\nHe said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: \"This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed Nort East England, North West England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire while on March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low of -22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

                    "body": "The warning across the Southeast, Midlands, and Wales will come into effect from 9 pm tonight and last until 10 am Tuesday, said the Met Office.For the Midlands, most of Wales, and the southeast, including London, a yellow weather warning for snow and ice is expected to go into effect overnight.\n\nThe Met Office has also issued warnings for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the northeastern part of England. In some isolated areas of Scotland, up to 30 cm of snow is forecast to fall.\n\nWith temperatures falling as low as -1C (30F) in Manchester and 2C (35F) in London on Monday night, patchy snowfall of 1-2 cm might build over most of Wales and portions of central, southern, and eastern England.\n\nThe alert is in effect from Monday at 9 pm to Tuesday at 10 am.\n\nNorthern Scotland could expect regular snow showers starting on Monday afternoon, according to the Met Office, with overnight lows possibly falling to -10C (14F).\n\nThe warnings follow Arctic air descending over Scotland and onto northern England.\n\nScotland might see up to 10 centimetres of snow on higher ground and 5 cm on lower ground as a result of the wintry weather.\n\nNortheast England, northwest England, and Yorkshire are under a level three cold weather notice from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), while the remainder of England is on a level two alert.\n\nAccording to the NHS, a level three notice indicates that there is a 90% possibility of extremely cold weather, slippery conditions, or heavy snow, all of which might pose a health risk to vulnerable people.\n\nUp until Thursday night at midnight, all communities are on alert.\n\nAccording to the Met Office, \"certain roads and railways are likely to be disrupted with lengthier trip times by road, bus, and train services\" as a result of this might disrupt travel.\n\nAfter initially announcing the warnings for Monday and Tuesday, it moved them forward to Sunday evening.\n\nThe warning was advanced, according to meteorologist Honor Criswick, who stated on Sunday: \"We are anticipating a couple of additional outbreaks of snow showers through this evening and seeing a little more precipitation early on.\n\n\"During the next several days, Scotland and northern areas of England may anticipate bitterly low temperatures and snow showers.\n\nIt will feel fairly cold and the breeze is kicking up a little bit, so it will be quite chilly. According to the forecast, northern Scotland could see lows of -10C on Monday night in protected glens and higher territory.\n\n\"It's possible that this year's lowest temperatures will be experienced here. The lowest temperature we have recorded was -10.4C in January, so anything may drop much lower.\"\n\nPower outages, ice roads, delays in air, train, and road traffic, and the isolation of certain remote populations are all potential effects of the warnings.\n\n\"If you can, try to heat your house to at least 18C if you can if you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over 65.\"",

This will slowly ease throughout the day with sunny spells elsewhere and scattered snow showers in the north east.\n\nWednesday's weather warning sees northern Scotland continuing to see the worst of the weather ( Image: Met Office) Wednesday\n\nScotland and parts of north and eastern England will see the same weather warning return Wednesday which will last until around mid-morning.\n\nThe major change come midweek is the introduction of a new snow warning that will cover almost all of the south coast of England.\n\nStretching from Brighton and Ashford all the way west almost to Truro, it will also cover north towards Reading, Bath and Bristol and southern Wales, including Cardiff.\n\nFrontal systems could bring some snow and rain to the south and southwest but otherwise areas will remain dry and cold with snow showers continuing in the north.\n\nAn updated weather warning for Wednesday now sees almost all the south coast affected ( Image: Met Office) Thursday and Friday\n\nThursday and Friday will both be marked by the same yellow snow warning which will cover the UK, all the way from Inverness south to Nottingham.\n\nIt will encompass north Wales and Northern Ireland too and is set to last from the early hours of the morning until around 6pm on both days.\n\nIt brings the continued threat of cold throughout the week and there is an increased likelihood of snow further south in the second half of the week.\n\nOn Thursday, milder air may edge in further north, bringing a risk of more snow and rain which could turn heavy in places. The rest of the UK will continue to stay cold.\n\nOn Friday, Brits will see continued risk of \"heavy snow and significant disruption\" - especially in the north. This may turn milder to the south and some parts could see strong winds.\n\nThe weather warnings for Thursday and Friday, which are more likely to see snow southwards ( Image: Met Office)\n\nMet Office meteorologists have also warned that more warnings are likely to come, and compared the upcoming cold blip to a freeze felt in December.\n\nUp to seven inches of snow could be seen on high ground in Scotland, with a couple of inches possible in parts of England.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nList of all the places affected by this week's weather warnings\n\nLondon & South East England:\n\nBracknell Forest Brighton and Hove East Sussex Hampshire Kent Oxfordshire Reading Southampton Surrey West Berkshire West Sussex Wokingham\n\nSouth West England:\n\nBath and North East Somerset Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Bristol Cornwall Devon Dorset Gloucestershire North Somerset Plymouth Somerset South Gloucestershire Swindon Torbay Wiltshire\n\nWest Midlands:\n\nHerefordshire Shropshire Staffordshire Stoke-on-Trent Telford and Wrekin\n\nNorth East England:\n\nDarlington Durham Gateshead Hartlepool Middlesbrough Newcastle upon Tyne North Tyneside Northumberland Redcar and Cleveland South Tyneside Stockton-on-Tees Sunderland\n\nNorth West England:\n\nBlackburn with Darwen Blackpool Cheshire East Cheshire West and Chester Cumbria Greater Manchester Halton Lancashire Merseyside Warrington\n\nEast Midlands:\n\nDerby Derbyshire Leicestershire Lincolnshire Northamptonshire Nottingham Nottinghamshire\n\nWales:\n\nBlaenau Gwent Bridgend Caerphilly Cardiff Carmarthenshire Ceredigion Conwy Denbighshire Flintshire Gwynedd Isle of Anglesey Merthyr Tydfil Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot Newport Pembrokeshire Powys Rhondda Cynon Taf Swansea Torfaen Vale of Glamorgan Wrexham\n\nCentral, Tayside & Fife:\n\nAngus Clackmannanshire Dundee Falkirk Fife Perth and Kinross Stirling\n\nGrampian:\n\nAberdeen Aberdeenshire Moray\n\nHighlands & Eile\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nRead More Read More Read More Read More Read More",

(Image: The Met Office)\n\nThe warning said: \"Ice and some snow leading to difficult travel conditions in places.\n\n\"Some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services.\"\n\nThe Met Office also said there were likely to be some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\n\nWhile people should be wary of icy surfaces as to avoid injuries from slips and falls.\n\nA spokesman added: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nThis is every region of Wales which could see snow as the Met Office issues a yellow weather warning:",

(Image: Met Office)\n\nSome roads and railways will \"likely\" be affected, with longer journey times expected, and \"probably\" some icy patches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\n\nThe winter sting in the tail is scheduled to last for most of the week - though weather warnings of snow and ice for Hertfordshire currently expire tomorrow morning, unlike in other regions.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"The impactful weather will continue through the second half of the week as mild air meets cold air with further snow, ice, wind and then rain likely later in the week and into the weekend.\n\nPlease support our independent journalism, and get access to exclusive news and sport stories, by signing up to a Watford Observer digital subscription today.\n\n\"From Wednesday, the focus of further snow is across parts of southern England and south Wales, with snow likely to lower levels for a time, and many may wake up to a couple of centimetres of snow on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall. With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.\"",

We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements, and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: \"This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed north-east England, north-west England, and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions, or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nSnow and ice are expected across much of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland tonight, the Met Office has said.\n\nThe forecasting body said temperatures in parts of the UK will drop below freezing and will not top mid-single figures during the day on Tuesday or Wednesday.",

                    "body": "HEAVY snow and ice from a polar Arctic blast will grip Scotland this week - and it's set to last for DAYS.\n\nBone-chilling temperatures of -10C are predicted for the parts of the country as the mercury plummets over the next few days.\n\nAnd The Met Office has issued a further yellow warning for snow and ice for most the country from 3am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland from Monday to Wednesday.\n\nForecasters predict temperatures will drop below freezing tonight - the coldest air of the year so far - and will not top mid-single figures during the day on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nFrom Thursday, snow could develop quite widely across most of Scotland by as a deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\nHigher parts of the Central belt and the southern Highlands could may see between 30cm to 40cm of snow by Friday.\n\nOther areas - including lower ground - could see 10cm to 20cm of snow over a 24-hour period.\n\nIn addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said conditions could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\nHe said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: \"This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was mins 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire while on March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low of minus 22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued a 39-hour snow warning for much of the UK this week.\n\nThe warning predicts snow for Scotland, parts of northern England, and much of Wales.\n\nThe forecaster is warning of \"heavy snow\" with the potential to cause \"significant disruption\" on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThis is what the Met Office are expecting: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\n\"Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places.\n\n\"In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nWarnings of snow are also in place further south on Wednesday.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"The impactful weather will continue through the second half of the week as mild air meets cold air with further snow, ice, wind and then rain likely later in the week and into the weekend.\n\n\"From Wednesday, the focus of further snow is across parts of southern England and south Wales, with snow likely to lower levels for a time, and many may wake up to a couple of centimetres of snow on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall. With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.\"\n\nIce will be an additional hazard for many through the week, with sub-zero temperatures creating some hazardous travel conditions. Temperatures could drop as low as -15\u00b0C overnight on Tuesday in some sheltered Scottish Glens, especially where there's fresh snow cover.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.''",

                    "body": "Stirling is braced for snow, with the Met Office warning that it could cause \"significant disruption\".\n\nA yellow weather warning has been issued, including for Stirling and Clackmannanshire, on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe warning is in place from 3am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday and forecasters have warned that it could see roads blocked and public transport facing delays and cancellations.\n\nSome communities could even become cut-off and it could cause issues with power supplies.\n\nA Met Office forecaster said: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\n\"Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\nClick here for more news and sport from the Stirling area.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area.\n\n\"Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40cm of snow in places. In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nThe warning is in place for Central, Tayside & Fife; the East Midlands; Grampian; Highlands & Eilean Siar; North East England; North West England; Northern Ireland; south west Scotland, Lothian Borders; Strathclyde; Wales; the West Midlands; and Yorkshire & Humber.",

                    "body": "A weather warning for heavy snow across Teesside and the north of England has been issued by the Met Office. The area is set to see the worst of conditions on Thursday and Friday as the arctic blast takes hold.\n\nThe national weather service issued the yellow level alert on Monday afternoon. \"Heavy snow has the potential to cause significant disruption on Thursday and Friday,\" says the alert with all parts of Teesside, Darlington and North Yorkshire covered by the warning.\n\nTimings for the latest warning are given from 3am on Thursday morning, March 9, to 6pm on Friday evening March 10.\n\nREAD NEXT:LIVE: Traffic and weather updates as Teesside hit by freezing conditions\n\nBetween 5cm and 10cm of snow is expected 'to many locations' even at low levels, says the Met Office, which is also warning of strong winds which could lead to blizzard conditions.\n\n\"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK. Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday,\" says the warning.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places. In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nTravellers are being warned there is a 'small' chance of delays and cancellations on bus and rail services as well as air travel, says the Met Office, as well as a 'slight' chance of blocked roads and interruptions to power supplies.\n\nThe warning covers most of Scotland and northern England, from the east coast to the west coast, and some parts of Wales. Teesside is already covered by a yellow snow and ice warning for Monday and Tuesday, March 6 and 7, with temperatures expected to hit -4C in Middlesbrough as an Arctic blast heads for the region.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nBusiness owner Beth unhappy after being told bringing dog to work is 'unprofessional' Detox bed announced for University Hospital of North Tees to help patients come off alcohol Popular Middlesbrough bakery slapped with 0* food hygiene rating and told to urgently improve Bride-to-be's devastation after \u00a39,000 wedding booking cancelled just weeks before big day For breaking news in your area direct to your inbox every day, go here to sign up to our free newsletter",

Very cold air will spread across the UK bringing snow showers even to sea level in the north on Monday and these snow showers could spread further south on Tuesday.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, it is likely weather warnings will be issued for Monday and Tuesday once the detail of potential impacts becomes clearer, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast.\"",

In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nRead next: Raging neighbours furious at 18 mile detour to get a pint of milk after road closes for weeks Minibus hits lorry debris after Ayrshire flip horror as road to remain closed for days Popular Ayrshire chippy crowned 'best in UK' at top national awards Devastated mum diagnosed with cancer after thinking she was doing 'too much' at the gym Deeply unpopular brown bin charge and recycling trolley service to be reviewed\n\nDon't miss the latest Ayrshire headlines - sign up to our free daily newsletter here",

                    "body": "It almost seems daft talking about snow in March, as spring is surely due to be sprung any day now?\n\nAlas, the promise of a glimmer of sunlight and nature blooming bright seems a touch further away than it did before.\n\nThere's a cold snap sweeping large parts of the country, and Monday, March 6 is set to be the UK's coldest day so far this year - and there's also talk of wintry showers to come.\n\nOften it's easy to assume any snowfall is only going to affect northern parts of the country - but is any scheduled to head down further south and to London this month?\n\nFrom Monday, March 6 to Tuesday, March 7, the Met Office has yellow weather warnings for snow and ice in place across swathes of the UK - including London and the South East.\n\nLondon's warning is in place from 9pm on Monday night until 10am the following morning.\n\nThe Met Office advises people to prepare for some 'ice and some snow leading to difficult travel conditions in places' - warning in particular of disruption to trains, other public transport and icy patches on un-gritted roads, paths and cycling lanes.\n\nSo much for springtime, eh?\n\nJudging by their London forecast, Tuesday, March 7 is set to see the capital's temperatures plummet to -1\u00b0C, as Arctic air rolls in, with snow forecast for the early morning.\n\nOn Wednesday, March 8, the Met Office predicts overcast skies, a still-cold 1\u00b0C temperature, plus a chance of sleet and possibly snow, which the BBC's forecast echoes.\n\nHowever, it seems the rest of the week is going to remain overcast, possibly rainy and windy, but a good few degrees warmer, though of course predictions may change.\n\nThat said, the Met Office's long-range forecast for the whole UK, from Friday, March 10 onwards, does seem to suggest snow is faintly possible down south later in the month, too.\n\nIt says: 'On Friday, very cold conditions are expected across the far north, accompanied by snow showers, although some sunny spells are possible away from any showers.\n\n'Elsewhere, milder, cloudier conditions are likely, with outbreaks of rain and some stronger winds possible. There is a small chance of more disruptive snowfall, particularly over hills.'\n\nFrom Monday, March 20 into April 2023, the meteorological office adds that 'rain and strong winds are more likely in the south, with a lower risk of snow at times'.\n\nIt continues: 'These milder conditions may extend north periodically, but it's possible that the cold but bright weather could return south to all parts through late March, bringing a return to drier conditions to the south.'\n\nBack to the week beginning March 6, and it's not just London and southern England affected by a brrr-worthy cold snap and Met Office yellow weather warnings.\n\nAlso hit by warnings are parts of Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland and North East England.\n\nScotland and the North East's warnings are slightly longer than the others, extending to all of Monday and Tuesday, and remaining in place until 10am on Wednesday morning.",

                    "body": "Snow and ice is expected across much of North Wales this week, the Met Office has said. The forecasting body said temperatures in parts of the UK will drop below freezing overnight and will not top mid-single figures during the day on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nNorth Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday. Temperatures will likely plummet to around 1C across North Wales, where a yellow warning is in place for every county: Conwy, Wrexham, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Anglesey and Gwynedd.\n\nThe warning is in place from 3am on Thursday, March 9, until 6pm on Friday, March 10.\n\nThe Met Office has said that the snowfall will cause significant disruption at the end of the week going into the weekend. There is a small chance that long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel could occur.\n\nRead more: Tragedy as three people found dead after five went missing in Wales\n\nThis is what could happen in North Wales towards the end of the week:\n\nThere is a slight chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers There is a small chance that communities could be cut off for several days There is a small chance that long interruptions to power supplies and other services, such as gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage, may occur\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to minus 1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night. Even colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week- with the mercury plunging to minus 4C in London and minus 6C in Birmingham and Belfast. Mr Madge said conditions could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\nHe said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year. The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude. We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual. People are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: \"This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some. \"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday. A level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was mins 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire while on March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low of minus 22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.\n\nDo you want it to snow? Let us know in the comments\n\nSnow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK. Parts of Northern Ireland, North Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\nEvent totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places. In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\n\nRead next:\n\nBleary-eyed residents complain of non-stop 'screeching' on North Wales railway line\n\nMajor update to Met Office snow maps for North Wales next week\n\nThe seaside village in a Welsh heartland where Cymraeg is rarely spoken\n\nI put Easter eggs from Asda, Aldi, Morrisons and M&S to the test against Cadbury to see which is best\n\nWhere every mobile speed camera in North Wales will be in March 2023",

We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements, and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: \"This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed north-east England, north-west England, and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions, or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.",

                    "body": "Met Office warnings for snow and ice have been issued for large parts of Wales this week. The forecasting service has issued a number of warnings that are in place at different times between Monday and Friday.\n\nThey are warning that in excess of 20cm of snow could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than 5cm is likely to accumulate even to lower levels in the northeast of the UK and there could be snow in Wales during the week.\n\nMet Office chief meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice, and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north. Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption is likely as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nBBC Breakfast forecaster Carol Kirkwood said on Monday morning: \"As the cold front sinks south it is allowing Arctic air to flow south behind it so a lot of wintry showers will move in. There will be a widespread frost tonight and in areas exposed to the northerly wind will see snow showers with temperatures to -8C in the Highlands.\n\n\"Tuesday is going to be a day for wrapping up warm. It will be 5C in Cardiff but when you add on the wind chill it will feel sub-zero for many parts of the country. Tuesday night is going to feel even colder than Monday night with a widespread frost and risk of ice.\"\n\nHere is the detailed forecast covering each day.\n\nMonday evening\n\nThe Met Office forecast for Monday evening says: \"A cloudy evening with light rain or snow at times. Drier overnight with some clear intervals developing in the north later. A frost and some icy patches forming. Gentle winds. Minimum temperature 0\u00b0C.\"\n\nMonday 9pm\n\nThe Met Office yellow warning for snow and ice starts at 9pm. It says: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places. Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow but 1-2cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area. The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nTuesday morning\n\nA yellow warning for snow and ice is in place until 10am and there is a warning it will feel very cold. Temperatures in Cardiff will be around 5C but will feel more like 0C in the northerly winds.\n\nThe Met Office forecast for Wales says: \"After a frosty start, a chilly day with plenty of sunshine and perhaps the odd snow shower. Temperatures dipping away quickly into the evening as the sun goes down. Maximum temperature 6\u00b0C.\"\n\nThe areas covered by the warning on Tuesday morning in Wales are:\n\nBlaenau Gwent Bridgend Caerphilly Cardiff Carmarthenshire Ceredigion Merthyr Tydfil Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot Newport Pembrokeshire Powys Rhondda Cynon Taf Swansea Torfaen Vale of Glamorgan. Wednesday\n\nA yellow warning for snow is place from midnight on Wednesday for 24 hours and says: \"Spells of snow reaching parts of southwest England late on Tuesday evening will then spread north during the early hours of Wednesday before clearing away eastwards during Wednesday daytime.\n\n\"Many parts can expect accumulations of 1-2cm of snow whilst over higher parts of southwest England, especially Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor and Exmoor, along with the hills and mountains of south Wales 5-10 cm of snow is likely for some. Untreated surfaces are also expected to become icy.\"\n\nThe Met Office forecast for Wales says: \"A bright but frosty start on Wednesday. Staying mostly dry, although cloud increasing.\"\n\nThe areas covered by this warning are:\n\nBlaenau Gwent Bridgend Caerphilly Cardiff Carmarthenshire Ceredigion Merthyr Tydfil Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot Newport Pembrokeshire Powys Rhondda Cynon Taf Swansea Torfaen Vale of Glamorgan. Thursday\n\nThe Met Office forecast for Wales says: \"Some rain or snow on Thursday, then milder to end the week with further rain. Rather windy.\" There is a Met Office weather warning for snow in parts of north Wales on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe yellow warning says: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK. Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales, and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5-10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15-20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt, and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places. In addition there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nThree people found dead after five went missing on night out\n\nRhys Webb considers offer to leave Welsh rugby\n\nMan hospitalised after being found with serious head injuries\n\nMet Office issues new heavy snow warning over the next five days in Wales",

Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing.\n\nA major change in the weather is under way for the UK, as cold air moves in from the north bringing snow, ice and plunging temperatures in the Highlands.\n\nWarnings for snow and ice have been issued with the initial focus of the most impactful snow in the region and North-East.\n\nThe Met Office has said further warnings are likely to be issued throughout the week.\n\nIn excess of 20 centimetres of snow could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than five centimetres is likely to accumulate even to lower levels in some parts of the north.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off.\n\n\"Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many.\"\n\nIce will be an additional hazard for many through the week, with sub-zero temperatures creating some hazardous travel conditions.\n\nTemperatures could drop as low as -15\u00b0C overnight on Tuesday in some sheltered Scottish glens especially where there's fresh snow cover.\n\nLight snow has started to fall in Aviemore but is yet to settle.\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said: \"Keeping a kit of essential items like a torch and warm clothes, in your vehicle, can be vital in case you and your passengers become stranded in winter.\n\n\"Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice and take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\n\n\"It is therefore always important to plan ahead for your journey, listen to the weather forecasts, and if weather conditions become challenging, adjust your driving behaviour and take extra care.\"\n\nStay up to date with the Met Office forecast on social media, through its weather warnings and by checking its mountain area forecasts which are written by trained meteorologists and are available under specialist forecasts on the Met Office website.",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued another warning for snow - this time lasting as long as 39 hours, with the risk of up to 40cm of snow. It comes as arctic airmass heads towards the UK this week, bringing with it high chances of ice and snow to Scotland and majority of England - including Leicestershire.\n\nThe warning is in place from 3am Thursday (March 9) until 6pm on Friday (March 10), covering the northern half of Britain. According to the Met Office, the cold conditions will force temperatures to plunge - with the country potentially set to face the coldest temperatures of the year so far.\n\nThe alert warns of long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel and that roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers. There is also a small chance that communities could be cut off for several day and risks of long interruptions to power supplies and other services, such as gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage.\n\nREAD MORE: Leicester warning update as Met Office forecasts 13 hours of snow and ice\n\nA Met Office spokesperson says: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\"\n\nParts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with areas of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday. Snowfall could amount to between five to 10 cm in many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern England and Scotland.\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places. In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nThe new 39-hour warning was issued shortly after the Met Office also put in place a separate 13-hour yellow warning for snow and ice across the Midlands. The alert will be in force from 9pm tonight (March 6) until 10am on Tuesday (March 7) - meaning 13 hours of bad weather possible.\n\nCommenting on tonight's warning, a Met Office spokesperson said: \"Some roads and railways are likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services. Some injuries possible from slips and falls on icy surfaces and there will probably be some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\"\n\nIn Leicestershire, outbreaks of rain this evening and overnight are predicted to become wintry over hills and perhaps to lower levels later, according to the Met Office. There is likely to be widespread frost and icy patches developing come morning, with minimum temperature at -3C.\n\nOn Tuesday, it will be a cold start, with widespread frost and icy patches. Thicker cloud will clear southwards, allowing bright or sunny spells to develop, along with a few wintry showers - maximum temperature reaching 5C. Heading into Wednesday and Friday in Leicestershire, it will remain very cold, with severe frosts overnight.\n\nOn Wednesday it will stay largely dry with bright or sunny spells at first, but then turning increasingly cloudy. Periods of rain and snow possible again on Thursday and Friday.\n\nAccording to BBC Weather, snow will fall in the county on Thursday (March 9). Current forecasts indicate hours of the white stuff from 6am to 2pm the same day as temperatures linger a couple of degrees around freezing.\n\nMeanwhile, a nationwide level three cold weather alert has been put in place by the Met Office and the UK Health Security Agency. The alert warns the weather will turn extremely cold from 1am tonight to midnight on Wednesday (March 8).\n\nCommenting on the alert, Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nProperty expert lists log burner mistakes which could put you in danger Shocking CCTV shows car spin off Belgrave Road as toddler is pulled to safety Boy, 11, still in a serious condition after Beaumont Leys e-scooter crash Young man slashed in early hours Leicester city centre knife attack Harry and Meghan issue statement over King Charles' coronation invite",

Very cold air will spread across the UK bringing snow showers even to sea level in the north on Monday and these snow showers could spread further south on Tuesday.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, it is likely weather warnings will be issued for Monday and Tuesday once the detail of potential impacts becomes clearer, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast.\"",

                    "body": "Staffordshire has been hit with a new warning for snow, with the 'Beast from the East' set to make its presence felt in the county.\n\nThe Met Office has issued a 39-hour yellow weather warning from 3am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday that covers the county but does not include the Black Country.\n\nStaffordshire, as well as neighbouring Shropshire, is towards the southern tip of the warning which covers the width of the country up to Inverness.\n\nIn its warning, the Met Office has said: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\"\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area.\n\n\"In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nDespite being excluded from the weather warning, snow is expected to fall in the Black Country between 6pm on Wednesday and 6am on Thursday, with forecasts for Wolverhampton, Walsall and Dudley all predicting snow.\n\nForecasters have also said some parts, such as North Wales and northern England, are expected to see the worst of the weather on Thursday, with Scotland and northern England getting the heaviest snowfalls on Friday.\n\nThe Met Office has also told people there are small chances of:\n\nIt also suggests there's a slight chance roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers.\n\nEarlier forecasts suggested that parts of the county would see snowfall between 6am and 9am on Thursday. However, towns such as Cannock, Lichfield and Stafford are now expected to see snow on Thursday evening, with a morning flurry expected in Cannock. Temperatures are expected to reach a peak of 5C (41F).\n\nThe new warning follows on from one for snow and ice that has been issued from 9pm today and 10am tomorrow, which also covers the Black Country, Birmingham and Worcestershire.\n\nAfter a grey and cold weekend, temperatures aren't expected to climb much this week, with highs of of 7C (45F) expected today, with tomorrow set to be slightly chillier as temperatures only forecast to reach as high as 5C (41F) or 4C (39F).\n\nHowever, night-time temperatures are set to hover around freezing, or even dip below. Tonight temperatures will stay around 0C (32F) and 2C (36F), but forecasters are predicting a colder Tuesday night of between -2C (28F) and -3C (27F) The following night are is expected to see temperatures stay around -1C (30F) across the region.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said conditions could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\nHe said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nIn its warning, which also covers the Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire, the Met Office has said: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nIn total, the weather warning runs from the western tip of South Wales, across to East Anglia, falling just short of Derby in the north and covering Winchester at its southern most point.\n\nThe Met Office outlook for the West Midlands from Wednesday to Friday stated: \"Mostly dry with some bright weather on Wednesday, after a frosty start. Cloudier and breezier thereafter with a chance of some rain or snow. Gradually turning less cold.\"\n\nBy Sunday, daytime temperatures across the Black Country and Staffordshire are expected to hit 11C (52F), with overnight temperatures remaining around 6C (43F)-7C (44F).\n\nAs gas prices remain high, the government are reminding people of the importance of staying warm.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C (64F) if you can.\"",

We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"",

                    "body": "Lancashire and Cumbria will be under a 39-hour snow warning from 3am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday.\n\nThe Met Office has acted as forecasts show 'heavy snow' heading to the region later this week. It comes as Arctic air moves over the country and down to northern England, possibly leading to the coldest temperature of the year so far.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-west England, north-east England, and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two. A level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nREAD MORE: Tell us where to buy the best pie in Lancashire to celebrate British Pie Week\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday. The Met Office has this afternoon (March 6) issued a new yellow weather warning for 'heavy snow' across most of Lancashire and Cumbria from Thursday onwards, with only some coastal areas including Blackpool, Fleetwood, Barrow, Whitehaven, Workington and Silloth not covered.\n\nThe yellow Met Office warning states: \"Heavy snow has the potential to cause significant disruption on Thursday and Friday. There is a small chance that long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel could occur.\n\n\"There is a slight chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers. There is a small chance that communities could be cut off for several days\n\n\"There is a small chance that long interruptions to power supplies and other services, such as gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage, may occur.\"\n\nThe Met Office adds: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK. Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places.\n\n\"In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nThe \u00a31 DIY hack that could stop your boiler breaking during cold weather\n\nMan charged with murder as victim is named\n\nCrash kills teenager and injures four more after colliding with tree\n\nMum's heartache at telling her kids their grandad had been murdered as they feared killers would come for them\n\nLancashire's Covid hotspots as one area in Preston records 500% increase",

The warning for Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire is in place from 3am on Thursday, March 9 until 6pm on Friday, March 10.\n\nIt comes as temperatures are expected to drop to as low as -5C tomorrow, with Wednesday also being cold with highs of just 3C. Snow has been forecast in the area for Thursday with sub-zero temperatures expected.\n\nThe Met Office says the predicted cold snap could lead to disruption including:\n\nRoads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services; Injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces; Probably icy patches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths\n\nChris Almond, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"Although we've moved into meteorological spring there will be a distinctly wintry feel to our weather this week. Very cold air will spread across the UK bringing snow showers even to sea level in the north on Monday and these snow showers could spread further south on Tuesday.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, it is likely weather warnings will be issued for Monday and Tuesday once the detail of potential impacts becomes clearer, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast.\"\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nStoke-on-Trent man with horrendous disease so rare only one other Brit has it\n\nFull list of UK's most wanted criminals by National Crime Agency - including seven in worldwide hunt\n\nFry-up fans' fury after guest served this Alton Towers breakfast\n\n'Heartbreak' as Midlands 'Mad Dog' Jeremy Kyle guest dies\n\nNew blow as Hays Travel becomes latest chain to quit Newcastle",

                    "body": "Swathes of the country are braced for snow and ice as forecasters warned the cold snap could last for a fortnight.\n\nThe Met Office said snow and ice are expected across much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Monday night, the Met Office has said.\n\nThe forecaster has issued a flurry of weather warnings and said temperatures in parts of the UK will drop below freezing on Monday and will not top mid-single figures during the day until Thursday.\n\nUp to 30cm of snow could fall in isolated spots across Scotland while other areas could see 10-20cm of snowfall. This week could see the coldest day of the year so far with temperatures in some areas falling as low as -10C or -15C.\n\nA yellow weather warning has been issued for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and South Wales from 9pm tonight until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time while a warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Scotland and North East England.\n\nThe area covered by the warning is set to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nGrahame Madge, from the Met Office, said temperatures could drop to -1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night.\n\nEven colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week, with the mercury plunging to -4C in London and - 6C in Birmingham and Belfast. Conditions are expected to be even colder in the north of Scotland.\n\nMr Madge said weather could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year,\" he said.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was minus 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire while on March 14, 1958, the mercury dropped to a record low of minus 22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

                    "body": "Swathes of the country are braced for snow and ice as forecasters warned the cold snap could last for a fortnight.\n\nThe Met Office said snow and ice are expected across much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Monday night, the Met Office has said.\n\nThe forecaster has issued a flurry of weather warnings and said temperatures in parts of the UK will drop below freezing on Monday and will not top mid-single figures during the day until Thursday.\n\nUp to 30cm of snow could fall in isolated spots across Scotland while other areas could see 10-20cm of snowfall. This week could see the coldest day of the year so far with temperatures in some areas falling as low as -10C or -15C.\n\nA yellow weather warning has been issued for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and South Wales from 9pm tonight until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time while a warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Scotland and North East England.\n\nThe area covered by the warning is set to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nGrahame Madge, from the Met Office, said temperatures could drop to -1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night.\n\nEven colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week, with the mercury plunging to -4C in London and - 6C in Birmingham and Belfast. Conditions are expected to be even colder in the north of Scotland.\n\nMr Madge said weather could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\n\"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year,\" he said.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was minus 9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire while on March 14, 1958, the mercury dropped to a record low of minus 22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

The warning is in force until 6pm on Friday.\n\nThe Met Office said snow could develop quite widely as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\nParts of Scotland and northern England are forecast to see the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\nUp to 10cm is expected widely, even in lower ground. In northern parts, accumulations as much as 20cm could be seen.\n\nHigher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 40cm of snow in places.\n\nThere is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\n\nThe Met Office said there was a chance some rural communities could become cut off amid the snow and ice.\n\nThere is a chance power cuts will occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected.\n\nDrivers have been warned to take extra care with delays on roads and risk of strandings likely with rail and air travel also facing possible disruption.\n\nThere is a yellow weather warning for snow and ice in effect across Tayside, Perth and Kinross, Fife, the Western Isles, Orkney, East Lothian, Midlothian and the Borders on Monday.\n\nIt came into force at midnight, and will remain in place until 10am on Tuesday before a second warning for snow and ice on Wednesday from midnight until 10am.",

                    "body": "Shropshire has been hit with a new warning for snow, with the 'Beast from the East' set to make its presence felt in the county.\n\nThe Met Office has issued a 39-hour yellow weather warning which starts at 3am on Thursday and runs until 6pm on Friday, that covers most of the county with only towns in the south such as Bridgnorth and Ludlow not included.\n\nShropshire and neighbouring Powys are at the southern tip of the warning which covers the width of the country up to Inverness.\n\nIn its warning, the Met Office has said: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\"\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area.\n\n\"In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nForecasters have also said some parts, such as North Wales and northern England, are expected to see the worst of the weather on Thursday, with Scotland and northern England getting the heaviest snowfalls on Friday.\n\nThe Met Office has also told people there are small chances of:\n\nIt also suggests there's a slight chance roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers.\n\nEarlier forecasts suggested that Shropshire would see snowfall between 6am and 9am on Thursday. In some towns in the north of the county, such as Oswestry, Market Drayton and Whitchurch, this has been extended until midday before rain falls later that evening. Temperatures are expected to reach a peak of 4C (39F).\n\nThe new warning follows on from one for snow and ice that has been issued from 9pm today and 10am tomorrow, mainly covering the southern half of the county.\n\nAfter a grey and cold weekend, temperatures aren't expected to climb much this week, with highs of of 7C (45F) expected today, with tomorrow set to be slightly chillier as temperatures only forecast to reach as high as 5C (41F) or 4C (39F).\n\nHowever, night-time temperatures are set to hover around freezing, or even dip below. Tonight temperatures will stay around 0C (32F) and 1C (34F), but forecasters are predicting a very cold Tuesday night of between -3C (28F) and -5C (23F). The following nights are also expected to see temperatures stay around -1C (30F) across Shropshire.\n\nIn its snow and ice warning, which also covers the Black Country, Staffordshire, Powys, Herefordshire and Worcestershire, the Met Office has said: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nIn total, the weather warning runs from the western tip of South Wales, across to East Anglia, falling just short of Derby in the north and covering Winchester at its southern most point.\n\nThe cold weather is expected to be clear by Sunday when daytime temperatures across Shropshire are expected to hit 12C (54F) and overnight temperatures rising to around 6C (42F)-(45F)C.\n\nAs gas prices remain high, the government are reminding people of the importance of staying warm.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C (64F) if you can.\"",

Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued a 39-hour snow warning for much of the UK this week.\n\nThe warning predicts snow for Scotland, parts of northern England, and much of Wales.\n\nThe forecaster is warning of \"heavy snow\" with the potential to cause \"significant disruption\" on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThis is what the Met Office are expecting: \"Snow could develop quite widely across the warning area on Thursday and Friday as a potentially quite deep area of low pressure moves across the UK.\n\n\"Parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales and northern England are currently expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday, with parts of Scotland and northern England then seeing the heaviest snow on Friday.\n\n\"Event totals could bring 5 to 10 cm of snow to many locations, even at low elevations, with potentially 15 to 20 cm accumulating across the northern portion of the warning area. Higher elevations of the North Pennines, Southern Uplands, higher parts of the Central Belt and the southern Highlands may see as much as 30 to 40 cm of snow in places.\n\n\"In addition, there is potential for strong winds, which may lead to blizzard conditions and drifting of lying snow.\"\n\nWarnings of snow are also in place further south on Wednesday.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"The impactful weather will continue through the second half of the week as mild air meets cold air with further snow, ice, wind and then rain likely later in the week and into the weekend.\n\n\"From Wednesday, the focus of further snow is across parts of southern England and south Wales, with snow likely to lower levels for a time, and many may wake up to a couple of centimetres of snow on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall. With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.\"\n\nIce will be an additional hazard for many through the week, with sub-zero temperatures creating some hazardous travel conditions. Temperatures could drop as low as -15\u00b0C overnight on Tuesday in some sheltered Scottish Glens, especially where there's fresh snow cover.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.''",

                    "body": "A major change in the weather is under way for the UK, as cold air moves in from the north, bringing snow, ice and low temperatures for many, the Met Office has said. Warnings for snow and ice have been issued with the initial focus of the most impactful snow in northeastern areas of the UK, as well as some Northern Ireland and southern and central areas of England and Wales.\n\nFurther warnings are likely to be issued throughout the week. In excess of 20cm of snow could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than 5cm is likely to accumulate even to lower levels in the northeast of the UK. While Northern Ireland will initially escape large accumulations of snow, 2cm could settle in some spots on Monday night, most likely over higher ground and over northern parts of Northern Ireland.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north. Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\nPictures from 2018's Beast from the East\n\nView gallery\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nIce will be an additional hazard for many through the week, with sub-zero temperatures creating some hazardous travel conditions. Temperatures could drop as low as -15\u00b0C overnight on Tuesday in some sheltered Scottish Glens, especially where there's fresh snow cover.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days. Dr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.''\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said: \"Keeping a kit of essential items like a torch and warm clothes, in your vehicle, can be vital in case you and your passengers become stranded in winter. Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice and take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\n\n\"It is therefore always important to plan ahead for your journey, listen to the weather forecasts, and if weather conditions become challenging, adjust your driving behaviour and take extra care.\"\n\nJames Coles of Scottish Mountain Rescue and Team Leader at Moffat Mountain Rescue said: \"The UK is entering a period of increasingly challenging weather conditions with snow, ice and gusty winds all featuring prominently in the forecast for the coming week. Upland areas, especially in the mountains, can see conditions change very rapidly and they may be markedly different from surrounding lowland areas.\"\n\nFrom late on Tuesday and early Wednesday, the snow risk is initially in the south as mild air gradually moves in from the southwest but brings with it snow as it meets the cold air. This risk of snow gradually spreads further north through the latter half of the week. Further warnings have been issued.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"The impactful weather will continue through the second half of the week as mild air meets cold air with further snow, ice, wind and then rain likely later in the week and into the weekend. From Wednesday, the focus of further snow is across parts of southern England and south Wales, with snow likely to lower levels for a time, and many may wake up to a couple of centimetres of snow on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall. With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.\"\n\nBy Friday, winds will also be increasing as low pressure moves in from the west. It remains uncertain where the boundary between the mild air to the south and cold air to the north will lie exactly, but southern areas are more likely to see cloud, wind and rain, while areas to the north of that boundary could see further disruptive snowfall, with strong winds possibly creating snowdrifts in places.",

There is a slight chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers\n\n\"There is a small chance that communities could be cut off for several days. There is a small chance that long interruptions to power supplies and other services, such as gas, water, telephone and mobile phone coverage, may occur.\"\n\nThe weather warning also covers much of the North West including Liverpool, as well as parts of Yorkshire including Sheffield and Leeds, and Bradford.\n\nTemperatures could drop as low -4 degrees Celsius in parts of Greater Manchester on Tuesday night, with the forecast unlikely to get far above freezing over the coming days.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\n'It used to be beautiful': The Curry Mile restaurateurs who say it's 'gone so downhill'\n\nTorment of wife of missing dad as trolls and 'social media detectives fuel speculation'\n\nBoy, 15, in a serious condition after stabbing outside McDonalds\n\n'The man was a legend' - Tributes paid to man who died after being hit by digger at industrial estate\n\nThe pretty village with no shops and one pub an hour from Greater Manchester",

                    "body": "A second weather warning for snow in Wales has been issued by the Met Office. Just hours after a warning for snow and ice was issued for Monday night into Tuesday morning, the forecasting service issued another warning for snow on Wednesday.\n\nThere could be up to 10cm on the hills in parts of south Wales.\n\nThe new warning, that is place from midnight on Wednesday for 24 hours, says; \"Spells of snow reaching parts of southwest England late on Tuesday evening will then spread north during the early hours of Wednesday before clearing away eastwards during Wednesday daytime.\n\n\"Many parts can expect accumulations of 1 to 2 cm of snow whilst over higher parts of southwest England, especially Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor and Exmoor, along with the hills and mountains of south Wales 5 to 10 cm of snow is likely for some. Untreated surfaces are also expected to become icy.\"\n\nThe areas covered by this warning are:\n\nBlaenau Gwent Bridgend Caerphilly Cardiff Carmarthenshire Ceredigion Merthyr Tydfil Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot Newport Pembrokeshire Powys Rhondda Cynon Taf Swansea Torfaen Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nThe first yellow alert is in place from 9pm on Monday until 10am on Tuesday and says: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area. The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nThere has been speculation for days that Arctic winds could bring snow to large parts of the UK.\n\nThe areas covered by the warning in Wales are:\n\nBlaenau Gwent Bridgend Caerphilly Cardiff Carmarthenshire Ceredigion Merthyr Tydfil Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot Newport Pembrokeshire Powys Rhondda Cynon Taf Swansea Torfaen Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nThe northerly airflow will sweep across the UK at the start of this and the Met Office says the introduction of an arctic maritime airmass will bring snow showers from Monday.\n\nDeputy Chief Meteorologist, Chris Almond, said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week. This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"",

                    "body": "Warnings for snow and ice have been issued with the initial focus of the most impactful snow in northeastern areas of the UK, as well as some Northern Ireland and southern and central areas of England and Wales.\n\nFurther warnings are likely to be issued throughout the week.\n\nIn excess of 20cm of snow could accumulate over high ground in Scotland and more than 5cm is likely to accumulate even to lower levels in the northeast of the UK.\n\nWhile Northern Ireland will initially escape large accumulations of snow, 2cm could settle in some spots on Monday night, most likely over higher ground and over northern parts of Northern Ireland.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri said: \"Snow, ice and low temperatures are the main themes of this week's forecast, as the UK comes under the influence of an arctic maritime airmass as cold air moves in from the north.\n\n\"Snow is already falling in parts of the north where some travel disruption likely, as well as a chance of some rural communities being cut off. Snow showers will continue through today and Tuesday here, and Northern Ireland will also be subject to some snow showers, especially over high ground.\n\n\"Ice will provide an additional hazard for many with overnight low temperatures well below 0\u00b0C for many. Further south wintry hazards will develop with parts of England and Wales affected by icy patches and snow in places tonight and likely further snow in parts of the south early Wednesday.\"\n\nGet advice for keeping your home warm, staying safe in snow, looking after your pets in cold weather and more as part of WeatherReady.\n\nIce will be an additional hazard for many through the week, with sub-zero temperatures creating some hazardous travel conditions. Temperatures could drop as low as -15\u00b0C overnight on Tuesday in some sheltered Scottish Glens, especially where there's fresh snow cover.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert for the whole of England which is likely to be reviewed in the coming days.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.''\n\nDale Hipkiss, National Network Manager at National Highways, said: \"Keeping a kit of essential items like a torch and warm clothes, in your vehicle, can be vital in case you and your passengers become stranded in winter. Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice and take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\n\n\"It is therefore always important to plan ahead for your journey, listen to the weather forecasts, and if weather conditions become challenging, adjust your driving behaviour and take extra care.\"\n\nJames Coles of Scottish Mountain Rescue and Team Leader at Moffat Mountain Rescue said: \"The UK is entering a period of increasingly challenging weather conditions with snow, ice and gusty winds all featuring prominently in the forecast for the coming week. Upland areas, especially in the mountains, can see conditions change very rapidly and they may be markedly different from surrounding lowland areas.\"\n\nStay up to date with the Met Office forecast on social media, through our weather warnings and by checking our mountain area forecasts, which are written by trained meteorologists and are available under specialist forecasts on the Met Office website.\n\nFrom late on Tuesday and early Wednesday, the snow risk is initially in the south as mild air gradually moves in from the southwest but brings with it snow as it meets the cold air. This risk of snow gradually spreads further north through the latter half of the week. Further warnings have been issued.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Steven Keates said: \"The impactful weather will continue through the second half of the week as mild air meets cold air with further snow, ice, wind and then rain likely later in the week and into the weekend.\n\n\"From Wednesday, the focus of further snow is across parts of southern England and south Wales, with snow likely to lower levels for a time, and many may wake up to a couple of centimetres of snow on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall. With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.\"\n\nBy Friday, winds will also be increasing as low pressure moves in from the west. It remains uncertain where the boundary between the mild air to the south and cold air to the north will lie exactly, but southern areas are more likely to see cloud, wind and rain, while areas to the north of that boundary could see further disruptive snowfall, with strong winds possibly creating snowdrifts in places.",

We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n'We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.'\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nThe risk of snow further south into England will grow from tomorrow. It might only start feeling milder in southern England from Friday but areas further north could stay chilly into next week.\n\nMet Office forecaster Craig Snell said the air was 'coming pretty much straight from the Arctic, which is especially cold at this time of year'.\n\nHe added: 'I would imagine you will see some sleet or snow in the south of England, even if it doesn't cause any great disruption.\n\n'But we are keeping a close eye on it.'\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nTYNE AND WEAR: Daredevils thought nothing of the icy temperatures today as they played and dodged in 20 foot high waves on Whitley Bay's Lower South Promenade\n\nTYNE AND WEAR: Huge waves crashed over the prom at Whitley Bay this morning as walkers and fishermen could be seen running from the crashing waves\n\nTYNE AND WEAR: Thrill-seekers stood on a man made structure this morning as waves at the Whitley Bay crashed over and splashed their group\n\nNORTH YORKSHIRE: The yellow weather warning, which started at 6pm yesterday, extends to Wednesday.

Most of them got wet,' said photographer Gren Sowerby, from Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, who captured the action.\n\n'It was bitterly cold but really good fun, I wouldn't want to have been on that promenade.'\n\nThe Met Office has issued snow warnings for this week, as northerly airflow is set to bring disruptive weather.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: 'This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n'Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.'\n\nThe UKHSA has urged people to look out for those most at risk from cold weather such as those with medical conditions or aged over 65.\n\nBritons are encouraged to ensure vulnerable residents have access to warm food and drinks and are managing to heat their homes adequately.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa from the UKHSA advised: 'During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n'If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.'\n\nExperts also advise avoiding exposure to cold or icy outdoor conditions if you are at a higher risk of cold-related illness or falls.\n\nSHETLAND: Snow-covered homes and yards in Shetland, Scotland this morning.

(Image: The Met Office)\n\nThe warning said: \"Ice and some snow leading to difficult travel conditions in places.\n\n\"Some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services.\"\n\nThe Met Office also said there were likely to be some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\n\nWhile people should be wary of icy surfaces as to avoid injuries from slips and falls.\n\nA spokesman added: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nThis is every region of Wales which could see snow as the Met Office issues a yellow weather warning:",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for north-east England - covering Lincolnshire. Residents are warned to expect the prospect of travel disruption from snow and ice within the next few days, with an alert lasting 34 hours from 9pm tonight until 10am Wednesday (March 8).\n\nThe Met Office warns of \"frequent snow showers\", with a \"chance of travel delays on roads\", with some stranded vehicles and passengers, along with delayed or cancelled rail and air travel. It also warns of a slight chance that some rural communities could become cut off and a danger of injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces. Power cuts could also occur.\n\nIt comes as arctic airmass from the north heads its way south towards the UK this week, forcing temperatures to plunge across the country - with the UK potentially set to face the coldest temperatures of the year so far. Snow is also possible on Thursday and Friday, according to forecasters.\n\nRead more: Cold weather alert issued for England as snow to hit parts of Lincolnshire\n\nBrits have been warned for the last few weeks that, according to long-range forecasts, March will get off to a cold start. A level three cold weather alert is also in place. It is in place until the end of Thursday.\n\nCommenting on the warning, Dr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health. If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded so far this year was -10.4C. But on Sunday (March 5), Met Office meteorologist Honor Criswick warned this could be beaten in parts of northern Scotland tonight - with winds making it feel even colder still.\n\nHe said: \"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at -10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nMet Office forecast for Lincolnshire for this week:\n\nToday\n\nA band of mainly light rain will clear eastwards this morning, with largely dry but cloudy conditions following. Some brighter spells are possible this afternoon before cloud thickens again this evening, but an increasing breeze means it will feel cold. Maximum temperature 8C.\n\nTonight\n\nOutbreaks of rain this evening and overnight, turning wintry over hills and perhaps to lower levels later. Coastal snow showers for Lincolnshire. Widespread frost and icy patches developing by morning. Minimum temperature -3C.\n\nTuesday\n\nA cold start, with widespread frost and icy patches. Thicker cloud will clear southwards, allowing bright or sunny spells to develop, along with a few wintry showers. Maximum temperature 5C.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday\n\nVery cold, with severe frosts overnight. Wednesday largely dry with bright or sunny spells at first, then increasingly cloudy, with periods of rain and snow possible Thursday and Friday.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\n'We named our six kids after things we love - we don't care what anyone thinks' Woman arrested after 12 guinea pigs die in shed fire at Skegness sanctuary Bailgate Guild chair says 'working together' is key after Christmas Market meeting Police searching for three women and two men reported missing after a night out in Cardiff have found three dead Shaken-up resident recalls 'screaming for help' after car smashes into her living room",

The capital lies in the path of a system working its way south from Scotland carrying flurries likely to settle on the city's icy ground.\n\nAnother yellow weather warning has been issued by the Met Office for ice and snow on Monday. It comes into force at 9pm and covers the Midlands, much of Wales and the South East, including London.\n\nThe Met Office said roads and railways are likely to be affected, causing potential travel disruption, while pedestrians have been warned to be careful on icy surfaces. The warning remains in place until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nChris Almond, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"Although we've moved into meteorological spring there will be a distinctly wintry feel to our weather next week. Very cold air will spread across the UK bringing snow showers even to sea level in the north on Monday and these snow showers could spread further south on Tuesday.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, it is likely weather warnings will be issued for Monday and Tuesday once the detail of potential impacts becomes clearer, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast.\"\n\nLondon's weather forecast for the rest of the week can be found below.\n\nTuesday:\n\nThicker cloud, rain and snow will clear southwards during the morning, allowing bright or sunny spells to develop from the north. Remaining cold. Maximum temperature 5 \u00b0C.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday:\n\nA very cold start Wednesday, then increasingly cloudy, with periods of rain, sleet and snow possible. Turning milder with rain and stronger winds Thursday and Friday.\n\nWant more from MyLondon?

                    "body": "Snow, ice and freezing temperatures caused disruption across the UK in January as an Arctic blast swept across the country.\n\nWhile February was much milder, even spring-like, at times, forecasters are now warning that a new cold snap is about to descend, bringing spells of snow and icy conditions stretch to parts of northern and eastern England causing by freezing Arctic air and prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning alert.\n\nUp to 5-10cm of snow is likely to accumulate over northern Scotland, which has been witnessing chilly conditions since Sunday with temperatures feared to plummet as low as -10C.\n\nIn other areas, temperatures are expected to be close to the freezing point as rain, sleet and snow edge slowly southwards, while maximum temperatures are also forecast to be in the single digits.\n\nThe Greater London area will see a maximum temperature of 7C while the minimum temperature can go down to 0C.\n\nDuring the January cold, schools in parts of the Scottish Highlands and Northern Ireland were forced to close their doors as a result of heavy snowfall, including in Shetland, Londonderry, Limavady and Strabane, with driving conditions deemed to be hazardous.\n\nOn snowy days, primary and secondary schools are advised by the government to make every effort to stay open.\n\nBut, occasionally, schools may be forced to close or operate at a reduced level, for example suspending individual classes, as a result of the weather.\n\nBut at what point would the wintry weather lead schools to close their doors? Here are the key questions and answers:\n\nAccording to the Department for Education, it is at the discretion of individual local authorities to decide whether closure is necessary based on their circumstances.\n\nUsually, schools will have tried and tested policies in place to help them navigate adverse weather conditions.\n\nSchools will have their own approaches for contacting parents. In many circumstances, they have their own apps and/or messaging services.\n\nHeadteachers will try to give parents as much notice as possible but sometimes decisions will be made quite late as circumstances change.\n\nThe government says local decision-making should be in large part based on common sense.\n\nBut there is a wide range of things that schools will consider, including staffing levels (if transport issues prevent teachers from getting to work, for example), safety conditions around the school, temperatures in school buildings and any heating system failures.\n\nAccording to the Education (School Premises) Regulations Act (1999), all school buildings must have a heating system to warm the rooms to the appropriate temperature.\n\nIf the temperature outside the school is -1C or below, the building's heating system should be able to reach the following temperatures at a height of 0.5m above floor level.",

                    "body": "The Met Office has extended its weather warning of \"frequent snow showers\" expected in northern Lincolnshire this week.\n\nPreviously, the yellow-level alert for snow and ice was in place until Tuesday, March 7 but now it will remain in force until Wednesday, March 8. The Met Office predicts there will be \"further disruption\" in some places.\n\nThe weather warning covers all of much of our region, including all of North East Lincolnshire and much of North Lincolnshire, extending north along eastern England and large parts of Scotland. It is possible that 2-5cm of snow will accumulate at lower levels.\n\nRead More: Where mobile speed cameras will be in the Grimsby and Scunthorpe area this week\n\nIn its updated warning, the Met Office said: \"Frequent snow showers will continue, causing further disruption in places.\"\n\nThe weather warning is in place all day on Monday, March 6 until 10am on Wednesday, March 8. Temperatures well below freezing are expected in the Grimsby and Scunthorpe area throughout Tuesday morning and on Wednesday the maximum temperature is expected to be around 4C in the afternoon.\n\nEarlier, the forecaster said: \"Cold, blustery northerly winds will continue to drive frequent showers of snow and hail into these areas on Tuesday. The highest accumulations are likely again over the high ground of northern Scotland, where another 5-10 cm are possible by the end of the day. Accumulations at lower levels are most likely overnight where 2-5 cm could accumulate locally. Icy stretches are also a likelihood, especially during hours of darkness.\"\n\nThere is a small chance of travel delays on roads as well as delayed or cancelled rail travel. There is also a small risk rural communities could become cut off and there will be a risk of injury from slips and falls on icy surfaces. Power cuts and disruption to mobile phone coverage could also occur, according to the Met Office.\n\nNational Highways has issued some advice for motorists travelling during the weather warning period.\n\nThomas Loach, Operations Manager of Yorkshire & North East at National Highways, said: \"In preparation for winter, keeping a kit of essential items like a torch and warm clothes, in your vehicle, can be vital in case you and your passengers become stranded. Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice and take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\n\n\"It is therefore always important to plan ahead for your journey, listen to the weather forecasts, and if weather conditions become challenging, adjust your driving behaviour and take extra care.\"\n\nRead Next:\n\n'Frustrated' disabled man wins parking fine challenge on Grimsby's most profitable street\n\n'I have turned my life around after stealing from my parents to fund heroin addiction'\n\nFull list of Lloyds Pharmacy chemists 'at risk of closure' in Grimsby and Scunthorpe areas\n\nJon from Cleethorpes wows ITV Starstruck judges after Bon Jovi transformation\n\nJohnny Depp drops in by helicopter - to shock of staff at famous Hemswell Antique Centres",

                    "body": "The Met Office has extended its weather warning of \"frequent snow showers\" expected in Hull and East Yorkshire this week.\n\nPreviously, the yellow-level alert for snow and ice was in place until Tuesday, March 7 but now it will remain in force until Wednesday, March 8. The Met Office predicts there will be \"further disruption\" in some places.\n\nThe weather warning covers all of East Yorkshire and much of northern Lincolnshire, extending north along eastern England and large parts of Scotland. It is possible that 2-5cm of snow will accumulate at lower levels.\n\nRead More: Met Office weather warning for Hull and East Yorkshire as 'frequent snow showers' forecast\n\nIn its updated warning, the Met Office said: \"Frequent snow showers will continue, causing further disruption in places.\"\n\nThe weather warning is in place all day on Monday, March 6 until 10am on Wednesday, March 8. Sub-zero temperatures are expected in East Yorkshire throughout Tuesday morning and on Wednesday the maximum temperature is expected to be 3C in the afternoon.\n\nEarlier, the forecaster said: \"Cold, blustery northerly winds will continue to drive frequent showers of snow and hail into these areas on Tuesday. The highest accumulations are likely again over the high ground of northern Scotland, where another 5-10 cm are possible by the end of the day. Accumulations at lower levels are most likely overnight where 2-5 cm could accumulate locally. Icy stretches are also a likelihood, especially during hours of darkness.\"\n\nThere is a small chance of travel delays on roads as well as delayed or cancelled rail travel. There is also a small risk rural communities could become cut off and there will be a risk of injury from slips and falls on icy surfaces. Power cuts and disruption to mobile phone coverage could also occur, according to the Met Office.\n\nNational Highways has issued some advice for motorists travelling during the weather warning period.\n\nThomas Loach, Operations Manager of Yorkshire & North East at National Highways, said: \"In preparation for winter, keeping a kit of essential items like a torch and warm clothes, in your vehicle, can be vital in case you and your passengers become stranded. Freezing conditions bring so many hazards such as snow and ice and take every possible step to understand your journey in advance and allow lots of extra time when travelling to prepare for the unexpected.\n\n\"It is therefore always important to plan ahead for your journey, listen to the weather forecasts, and if weather conditions become challenging, adjust your driving behaviour and take extra care.\"\n\nRead Next:\n\nYorkshire Water shares hairdryer trick ahead of -4C cold snap Spring on hold as -6C cold snap and snow on way\n\nFly-tipping or art?

                    "body": "Snow and ice is expected across much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Monday night, the Met Office has said.\n\nThe forecasting body said temperatures in parts of the UK will drop below freezing on Monday night and will not top mid-single figures during the day on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nUp to 30cm of snow could fall in isolated spots across Scotland while other areas could see 10-20cm of snow fall.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England.\n\nThe area covered by it is set to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to minus 1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night.\n\nMr Madge said conditions could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\nHe said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire while on March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low of -22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

(Image: The Met Office)\n\nThe warning said: \"Ice and some snow leading to difficult travel conditions in places.\n\n\"Some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services.\"\n\nThe Met Office also said there were likely to be some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\n\nWhile people should be wary of icy surfaces as to avoid injuries from slips and falls.\n\nA spokesman added: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nThis is every region of Wales which could see snow as the Met Office issues a yellow weather warning:",

                    "body": "Snow and ice is expected across much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Monday night, the Met Office has said.\n\nThe forecasting body said temperatures in parts of the UK will drop below freezing on Monday night and will not top mid-single figures during the day on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nUp to 30cm of snow could fall in isolated spots across Scotland while other areas could see 10-20cm of snow fall.\n\nA yellow weather warning will be in place for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and South Wales from 9pm on Monday night until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England.\n\nThe area covered by it is set to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to minus 1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night.\n\nEven colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week- with the mercury plunging to minus 4C in London and minus 6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\nMr Madge said conditions could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\nHe said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: \"This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire while on March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low of -22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

But the cold snap will really take hold tomorrow night and into the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nWinsford is predicted to have the coldest conditions with the temperature set to fall as low as -6\u00b0 tomorrow night, with Chester and Crewe -5\u00b0, Ellesmere Port and Macclesfield -4\u00b0 and the likes of Runcorn, Widnes and Warrington -3\u00b0. Yellow warnings for snow and ice have been issued for large parts of the UK, including the north east, Midlands, London, and parts of Scotland and Wales, and are in place until Wednesday\n\nREAD MORE: Child left with no school to go to for two years as mum says UK system is failing\n\nDeputy Chief Meteorologist, Chris Almond, said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week. This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nJames Coles of Scottish Mountain Rescue and Team Leader at Moffat Mountain Rescue said: \"The UK is entering a period of increasingly challenging weather conditions with snow, ice and gusty winds all featuring prominently in the forecast for the coming week. Upland areas, especially in the mountains, can see conditions change very rapidly and they may be markedly different from surrounding lowland areas.\n\n\"Met Office warnings come into force on Monday, but conditions ahead may deteriorate more quickly at higher elevations.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued Level 2 and Level 3 Cold Weather Alerts for the whole of England. These are likely to be reviewed and extended in the coming days.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.''\n\nNEWSLETTER: Sign up for CheshireLive email direct to your inbox here\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nShocking moment huge tree falls onto busy Crewe road in felling blunder\n\nCheshire West and Chester Council set to spend \u00a36.3m on houses for Ukrainian and Afghan refugees\n\nMan who 'brought misery' to Chester is banned from city centre\n\nVan driver caught fly-tipping on secret camera in Ellesmere Port\n\nEllesmere Port florist shuts up shop due to 'astronomical running costs'",

We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire while on March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low of -22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

                    "body": "The UK is set to see heavier snow on Monday as icy conditions stretch to more parts of northern and eastern England after a yellow warning alert was issued by the Met Office following the arrival of Arctic air.\n\nUp to 5-10cm of snow is likely to accumulate over northern Scotland which has been witnessing chilly conditions since Sunday with temperatures feared to plummet as low as -10C.\n\nIn other areas, temperatures are expected to be close to the freezing point as rain, sleet and snow edge slowly southwards, while maximum temperatures are also expected to be in the single digits.\n\nThe Greater London area will see a maximum temperature of 7C while the minimum temperature can go down to 0C.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Craig Snell said up to 20cm (4 inch) of snow could fall on high ground, with up to 10cm possible in low-lying regions.\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland and could creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued a cold weather alert and placed North-East England, North-West England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nShowers are expected to continue into Monday night and ice is likely to form on untreated surfaces where snow has melted by day.\n\nAreas under the Met Office's yellow weather warning are:\n\nThe Met Office earlier issued a yellow warning starting at 6pm on Sunday for snow in the north-east of Scotland, including Shetland.\n\nAccording to deputy chief meteorologist Chris Almond, \"very cold air\" is set to be spreading across the UK through the week.\n\n\"This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\"\n\nJames Coles, team leader at Moffat Mountain Rescue, advised that upland areas, especially in the mountains, could see conditions change very rapidly, and they may be markedly different from surrounding lowland areas.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at -10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nIt is important to take extra precautions when travelling in these areas, especially if it is necessary to go out in the snow and ice.",

                    "body": "A yellow weather warning for snow and ice has been issued for large parts of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland by the Met Office.\n\nSnow and ice is expected across much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Monday night, the Met Office has said.\n\nThe forecasting body said temperatures in parts of the UK will drop below freezing on Monday night and will not top mid-single figures during the day on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nUp to 30cm of snow could fall in isolated spots across Scotland while other areas could see 10-20cm of snow fall.\n\nA yellow weather warning will be in place for London, the Thames Valley, East Anglia, parts of the Midlands and South Wales from 9pm on Monday night until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nAn identical one will be in place in Northern Ireland at the same time.\n\nA yellow weather warning for snow and ice is already in place in much of Northern and Eastern Scotland and North East England.\n\nThe area covered by it is set to extend as far south as Hull from Tuesday before it lifts at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures could drop to minus 1C in Manchester and 2C in London on Monday night.\n\nEven colder overnight conditions are set to hit cities later in the week- with the mercury plunging to minus 4C in London and minus 6C in Birmingham and Belfast.\n\nMr Madge said conditions could be similar to those experienced during a cold snap in December 2022 and may not lift for almost a fortnight.\n\nHe said: \"Temperatures will be much, much colder than we would expect at this time of year.\n\n\"The pattern will set in for some time. We have got this feed of cold air coming in from a much higher latitude.\n\n\"We expect these conditions to remain in place until at least next weekend and possibly longer because sometimes these conditions can be quite stubborn and not easily subject to change.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned travel disruption is likely and journey times by car, train and bus may take longer than usual.\n\nPeople are at risk of slipping and falling on icy patches of untreated roads, pavements and paths while some rural communities could become cut off from the power grid.\n\nMr Madge said: \"This is a disruptive spell of weather which could have quite serious consequences for some.\n\n\"Listen to the forecast, take account of weather warnings and expect to see some potentially disruptive conditions wherever you are.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert, with the rest of England at level two, until midnight on Thursday.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded last March was -9.1C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire while on March 14 1958 the mercury dropped to a record low of -22.8C at Logie Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued a snow and ice warning, with forecasts suggesting it could fall as low as -4 in Cambridge this week.\n\nAfter temperatures fall on Monday night, they will stay low throughout Tuesday, reaching about 4C in Cambridge in the afternoon, before plummeting below freezing from about 9pm.\n\nBy 2am, it could reach -4C in the city, and -3C across much of the rest of Cambridgeshire.\n\nIt is expected to remain below freezing until about 9am on Wednesday, which could create problems for the school run and those travelling to work.\n\nIt may dip below freezing again overnight on Wednesday, before temperatures recover to around 4C during the day on Thursday, 7C or 8C on Friday and 9C or 10C on Saturday.\n\nIssuing a yellow weather warning that covers much of the country, including Cambridgeshire, from 9pm on Monday, the Met Office said: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1cm to 2cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area. The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nSee a full weather forecast here.\n\nMeanwhile, National Highways pleaded for drivers to be patient when encountering its gritters, which look after 4,500 miles of A-roads and motorways.\n\nDarren Clark, severe weather resilience manager at National Highways, said: \"As our gritting teams go out to spread salt on the roads, our message is simple to all road users: 'Please be patient and give us the time and space to do what we need to do to keep you safe.\n\n\"If you are going to pass us, please do so courteously, pass us safely and legally, or even better, if you are able to stay back, you will actually help the salt on the road activate even more quickly by crushing and breaking it into the road surface which benefits everyone.\n\n\"It's worth remembering too, we are not gritting all the time. Some of our fleet may come off at particular junctions or return to depots while other vehicles take over, lowering any inconvenience to motorists. We are once again totally committed to working around the clock on these seasonal operations to keep all road users safe and thank everyone in advance for their patience and understanding.\"\n\nCambridgeshire County Council, as highways authority, is responsible for gritting other roads and pavements.",

                    "body": "Leicestershire residents are being urged to plan ahead and wrap up warm as snow is set to fall across the county - and many other parts of the Midlands. Cold conditions expected over the coming days have triggered a snow and ice warning from the Met Office, with the chilly weather expected to cause disruption during a 13 hour-long window.\n\nThe yellow severe alert will be in force from 9pm tonight (March 6) until 10am on Tuesday (March 7) - meaning 13 hours of bad weather possible. It comes as arctic airmass from the north heads its way south towards the UK this week, forcing temperatures to plunge across the country - with the country potentially set to face the coldest temperatures of the year so far.\n\nA Met Office spokesperson warns: \"Some roads and railways are likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services. Some injuries possible from slips and falls on icy surfaces and there will probably be some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Property expert lists log burner mistakes which could put you in danger\n\nThe spokesperson added that a band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday in the UK. The rain is set to turn to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\nMany areas of Britain will see little or no accumulations of snow, but one to two cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area. The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\n\nIn Leicestershire, outbreaks of rain this evening and overnight are predicted to become wintry over hills and perhaps to lower levels later, according to the Met Office. There is likely to be widespread frost and icy patches developing come morning, with minimum temperature at -3C.\n\nOn Tuesday, it will be a cold start, with widespread frost and icy patches. Thicker cloud will clear southwards, allowing bright or sunny spells to develop, along with a few wintry showers - maximum temperature reaching 5C. Heading into Wednesday and Friday in Leicestershire, it will remain very cold, with severe frosts overnight.\n\nOn Wednesday it will stay largely dry with bright or sunny spells at first, but then turning increasingly cloudy. Periods of rain and snow possible again on Thursday and Friday.\n\nAccording to BBC Weather, there could be snow falling on us again on Thursday (March 9). Current forecasts indicate hours of the white stuff from 6am to 2pm the same day as temperatures linger a couple of degrees around freezing.\n\nThe coldest temperature recorded so far this year was -10.4C. But on Sunday (March 5), Met Office meteorologist Honor Criswick warned this could be beaten in parts of northern Scotland tonight - with winds making it feel even colder still.\n\nHe said: \"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at -10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nA nationwide level three cold weather alert has been put in place by the Met Office and the UK Health Security Agency. The alert warns the weather will turn extremely cold from 1am tonight to midnight on Wednesday (March 8).\n\nCommenting on the alert, Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nWhat is a cold weather alert?\n\nAccording to the Met Office, the cold weather health watch comprises five levels of response based on cold weather thresholds. The thresholds have been developed to trigger an alert when severe cold weather is likely to significantly affect people's health.\n\nThe alerts take account of temperature along with other winter weather threats such as ice and snow. A Cold weather health watch system operates in England from the 1 November to 31 March every year, in association with UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).\n\nHowever, should thresholds for an alert be reached outside of this period, an extraordinary heat-health alert will be issued and stakeholders are advised to take the usual public health actions.\n\nThe current cold weather alert in place for whole of England states: \"There is at least a 60 per cent probability of severe cold weather/icy conditions/heavy snow between 0001 on Monday 06 Mar and 2359 on Wednesday 08 Mar across England - with a 70 per cent chance in the West Midlands.\n\n\"This weather could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients and disrupt the delivery of services. Please refer to the national Cold Weather Plan and your Trust's emergency plan for appropriate preventive action.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nSnow update for Leicester as -5C, 21 hours of showers and cold weather alert issued Shocking CCTV shows car spin off Belgrave Road as toddler is pulled to safety All the under-performing GP surgeries in Leicestershire Two boys hospitalised after being hit by car while riding e-scooter in Leicester Parent wants to give baby boy a girl's name - but worries he'll hate it",

The weather forecaster has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice between 9pm on Monday, March 6 and 10am on Tuesday, March 7.\n\nA band of rain is expected to edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, turning to snow on hills and lower areas in some places. The Met Office has warned those in the yellow warning zone, which is affecting a large chunk of the East Midlands, of its potential dangers.\n\nIt said: \"Some roads and railways likely to be affected, with longer journey times by road, bus and train service. Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces.\n\nREAD NEXT: Snow predictions for Derbyshire as the cold snap bites\n\n\"Probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths. Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but one to two centimetres could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nTuesday and Wednesday are expected to be drier, with the chance of a few sunny spells. But clear nights could mean temperatures fall down as low as -5C - maybe even colder in some parts of the county.\n\nThe warning mainly affects the south of the county, with the area beneath the A50, including Repton, Swadlincote and Melbourne included.\n\nWant the biggest Derbyshire stories sent straight to your inbox?

Newsquest.)\n\nAs yellow warnings are put in place for snow in the northeast of Scotland, the Met Office has advised that light snow will arrive in the city on Thursday, March 9.\n\nBeginning at around midday on Thursday, Glasgow is expected to have snow until Friday afternoon, then another flurry on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Met Office forecast reads: \"Dry, sunny and cold on Wednesday and Thursday. Widespread overnight frost, severe in places. Chance of rain or snow on Friday.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Global gym brand and fashion retailer opening soon at Glasgow shopping centre\n\nIt comes after yellow warnings for snow across Scotland were brought forward as Arctic air moves over the country and down to northern England, possibly leading to the coldest temperature of the year so far.\n\nThe Met Office said temperatures could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.",

New weather maps reveal which areas will be worst affected with Coventry and Warwickshire likely to be on the fringes of wintry showers.\n\nThe Met Office had earlier predicted that flakes would fall at some point next week as temperatures begin to drop - though they admitted they were not clear \"where and when\". Radar data from independent forecaster WXCharts now shows a large area - marked in deep red - with up to a 90% likelihood of snow forming over the next 24 hours, MirrorOnline reports.\n\nAccording to the map, only the south of England looks destined to definitely escape snow flurries. Parts of the Midlands and almost all of Wales face a high probability of snow by Monday evening.\n\nREAD MORE: Men jailed over violent disorder ahead of fatal stabbing in Coventry\n\nA burst of cold northerly winds, dropping to a blistering -10C overnight on higher ground, will deliver snow in parts of Scotland and the north of England today. It comes after the Met Office was forced to update its weather warnings for snow, as gusts from the Arctic started to arrive in the UK earlier than expected.\n\nHighs of around 8C are expected in Coventry today, according to the Met Office. But the mercury will drop to around 3C by 10pm when there's an outside chance of wintry showers. Wednesday promises to be the coldest day of the week with snow expected to land in Coventry around midday.\n\nMet Office deputy chief meteorologist Chris Almond said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week. This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time. So keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nYellow warnings for snow, meaning some disruption is likely, are in force in part of Scotland and the north-east England. They will apply until midnight on Wednesday.\n\nWest Midlands weather forecast Today:\n\nOccasional bright spells are expected, although much of the day looks rather cloudy. There will also be some showers, these turning a little wintry especially over the hills later on. Gentle winds, but feeling rather chilly. Maximum temperature 8 \u00b0C.\n\nTonight:\n\nA cloudy evening with some light rain or snow at times. Turning drier overnight with some clear intervals developing later. A frost and some icy patches forming. Light winds. Minimum temperature 0 \u00b0C.\n\nTuesday:\n\nAfter a cold start, a bright day with plenty of sunshine, though the odd wintry shower. Remaining chilly. Temperatures dropping quickly during the evening as skies clear. Winds remaining light. Maximum temperature 6 \u00b0C.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday:\n\nMostly dry with some bright weather on Wednesday, after a frosty start. Cloudier and breezier thereafter with a chance of some rain or snow. Gradually turning less cold.\n\nFor all the latest Coventry news, sign up to our newsletter here.\n\nRead next:\n\nMen jailed over violent disorder ahead of fatal stabbing in Coventry\n\nWoman fights back after neighbours throw condoms over her garden fence in Coventry\n\nNew McDonald's restaurant creates 130 jobs in Coventry\n\nTyre tracks left on grass after caravans pitch up near playground in Coventry\n\nTwo men rushed to hospital after crash in Coventry",

Wider travel delays are also predicted as some air and rail journeys may be cancelled.\n\nThere is a chance that more rural communities will be closed off, as well as possible power cuts which may affect services like mobile phone coverage. Pedestrians are also being urged to stay safe to avoid injuries from slips on icy roads.\n\nDeputy Chief Meteorologist Chris Almond said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week. This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about Scotland's latest weather warning, including how long it will last and areas affected.\n\nYellow weather warning for Scotland - Snow and ice\n\nWhen: midnight on Monday, March 6 - until 10 am, Wednesday March 8.\n\nA yellow weather warning is in place for snow which began at midnight, Monday March 6 and will last until midnight on Tuesday, March 7.\n\nThe Met Office said: \"A band of rain, sleet and snow is expected to move south during Monday followed by frequent snow and hail showers. Whilst the highest accumulations of 5-10 cm are most likely over northern Scotland, there is a small chance of more organised and persistent spells of snow developing elsewhere in this area, and could bring 2 to 5 cm even at lower levels.\n\n\"Into Monday night, showers are expected to continue, and ice is likely to form on untreated surfaces where snow has melted by day.\"\n\nRegions and local authorities affected\n\nCentral, Tayside & Fife\n\nAngus Dundee Fife Perth and Kinross\n\nGrampian\n\nAberdeen Aberdeenshire Moray\n\nHighlands & Eilean Siar\n\nNa h-Eileanan Siar Highland\n\nOrkney & Shetland\n\nOrkney Islands Shetland Islands\n\nSW Scotland, Lothian Borders\n\nEast Lothian Midlothian Council Scottish Borders\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here .\n\nREAD NEXT: Bargain holiday locations as Post Office reveals the best exchange rates Harry had 'nothing to lose' ahead of trauma tell-all, experts claim Scots shopping centre offers 'pay what you can' hub for winter clothes",

                    "body": "Below freezing temperatures could continue in Scotland until at least March 11\n\nA yellow weather warning has been issued for snow and ice in parts of Scotland and northern England as temperatures are set to plummet to as low as -8C.\n\nUp to four inches of snow will blanket some parts of the country today and what will be a noticeable chillier than usual start to the spring season.\n\nThe weather warning, which started at 6pm on Sunday, extends to just before midnight on Tuesday and covers the northern part of Scotland, including Aberdeen and Inverness.\n\nTemperatures are also set to plummet to -8C in some parts of Scotland, with below freezing temperatures predicted to continue until March 11 at least amid a Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event.\n\nSnow and ice are also set to descend on northern England, the east coast of England and Northern Ireland caused by freezing Artic air after a spate of calmer conditions.\n\nThe recent benign conditions are down to an area of high pressure, which is now moving away to the west, allowing a northerly airflow to sweep across the UK.\n\nThe chance of snow in the south is at its highest after Tuesday.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nSnow will blanket parts of the country today including Scotland and northern England in what will be a noticeably cooler than usual start to the spring season\n\nA yellow weather warning is issued when there is a small chance of travel delays, minor injuries due to ice, power cuts, and the cutting off of rural areas\n\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning from 6pm this evening for snow and ice for parts of Scotland (Sunday weather warnings)\n\nThe Met Office said the start of next week will be the coldest day of the year so far, with temperatures dropping to near freezing in northern parts of the UK.

Advertisement\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has also issued a cold weather alert between the early hours of this morning and midnight on Thursday.\n\nA yellow weather warning is issued when there is a small chance of travel delays, minor injuries due to ice, power cuts, and the cutting off of rural areas.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency reminded people to look after the vulnerable. Its cold weather alert will take force from early today and last until midnight on Thursday.\n\nThe north east of England, north west of England and Yorkshire are all under a level three alert, while the rest of the country remain at a level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nThe agency said if a person is over the age of 65 or has a pre-existing medical condition, they should try to heat their home to at least 18C during the cold snap.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: 'During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\nA family enjoys the snow in Tomintoul today. Kate and Fraser Gormley were out in the cold weather with their four-year-old twins\n\nA car in the snow near Tomintoul, a village in Scotland, on Sunday. A Met Office yellow warning for snow comes into force at 6pm\n\nParts of England could also be in for cold and snowy weather this week (Pictured Stoke-on-Trent during the January cold snap this year)\n\nWhat is a Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW)?\n\nA sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is a term used to describe a phenomenon in which the temperature in the stratosphere, a layer of the Earth's atmosphere, increases rapidly.\n\nThe warming can cause the circulation of air at the poles to reduce speed, or even reverse its trajectory.\n\nThis in turn can have a major impact on weather patterns, pushing cold air down from the poles and bringing a storm of freezing weather and blizzards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.'\n\nTemperatures are likely to remain well below the average for March over the next week, the Met Office said.\n\nDeputy Chief Meteorologist, Chris Almond, said: 'Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week.\n\n'This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n'With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time.'\n\nJames Coles of Scottish Mountain Rescue and Team Leader at Moffat Mountain Rescue added: 'The UK is entering a period of increasingly challenging weather conditions with snow, ice and gusty winds all featuring prominently in the forecast for the coming week.\n\n'Upland areas, especially in the mountains, can see conditions change very rapidly and they may be markedly different from surrounding lowland areas.\n\n'Met Office warnings come into force on Monday, but conditions ahead may deteriorate more quickly at higher elevations.'\n\nThe cold snap could also prolong Britain's food shortages, with crops set to suffer in the freezing temperatures.\n\nExperts have warned cucumber and tomato crops will be delayed, as salad items across the country are being rationed in supermarkets amid ongoing shortages.\n\nIt comes as droughts and frosty weather over the Christmas period stunted the growth of carrots, cauliflower, leek and cabbage crops, with warnings that stocks of these vegetables are also set to dwindle.\n\nThe severe weather, which is the result of an Artic Maritime Airmass sweeping across the UK, comes after a drier February than usual.\n\nThe UK saw just 45 per cent of its average rainfall for the month, with 43.4mm of rain in February, making it the driest in 30 years.\n\nDespite unusually cold conditions for this time of year, it is not the latest that the UK has seen a cold snap.\n\nLast year, Londoners shivered under one of the coldest April nights on record as temperatures fell to -3C, and snow blanketed the capital.",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued a 13-hour yellow weather warning as ice and snow look set to hit the UK. Berkshire is among the areas that come under the boundaries of the warning.\n\nThe yellow warning will come into force at 9pm tonight (March 6) and will stay in effect until 10am on Tuesday morning (March 7). The entirety of Berkshire is covered by the warning which also affects neighbouring counties such as Oxfordshire, Hampshire and Surrey.\n\nThe Met Office has warned of significant disruption should the snow and ice fall as forecast. Transport links are among the services likely to be disrupted by any snow and ice.\n\nREAD MORE: BBC Weather forecasts snow and sleet for Berkshire towns this week\n\nRoads and railways are likely to be affected with longer journey times expected for motorists and those using some public transport services. Slippery roads may also make for more difficult driving conditions so motorists should adjust their speeds accordingly.\n\nSlippery surfaces, including pavements, may also lead to an increase in slips and falls so pedestrians should take care. There is also a possibility that some untreated roads and bridleways may be covered in ice causing issues for both cars and cyclists.\n\nIn the warning, the Met Office has said: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places. Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nGet more news from BerkshireLive straight to your inbox for free HERE .\n\nRead next:\n\nReading robbery sees woman 'pulled to the floor' as two suspects steal her bag\n\nReading man jailed for attacking woman and controlling her life\n\nHigh street Co-op shut after burglary with cash stolen\n\nThe 26 Berkshire GP surgeries that saw fewer than half of patients face-to-face\n\nMotorcyclist jailed after killing Reading woman in crash",

                    "title": "New Met Office warning for snow and ice across England and Wales",
                    "body": "The Met Office has issued a new two-day weather warning of snow and ice across a huge swathe of England and Wales, coming into force at 9pm tonight. It follows one already issued for the whole of Scotland and North East England in place until Wednesday.\n\nThe new alert reads: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nWhat to expect Some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces Probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle path\n\nThe warning stays in force until 10am on Tuesday while the northern alert is in place until 10am on Wednesday.\n\nThe warning reads: \"Cold, blustery northerly winds will continue to drive frequent showers of snow and hail into these areas on Tuesday. The highest accumulations are likely again over the high ground of northern Scotland, where another 5-10 cm are possible by the end of the day. Accumulations at lower levels are most likely Tuesday early hours where 2-5 cm could accumulate locally. During Tuesday night, showers will then tend to become increasingly confined to northern Scotland. Icy stretches are likely, especially on untreated surfaces, particularly during hours of darkness.\"\n\nThe Met Office said temperatures could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow warning starting at 6pm on Sunday for snow in the north-east of Scotland, including Shetland.\n\nIt advises this could cause disruption to travel, with \"some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services\".\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward.\n\n\"We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly.\n\n\"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

                    "body": "A yellow warning of snow and ice has been issued for London - while the week could bring the UK's coldest weather so far this year.\n\nThe Met Office warning has been put in place across the capital and a large part of southern England and Wales from 9pm on Monday until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nRoads and railways could be affected by \"difficult travel conditions\", the Met Office warns.\n\nYellow snow warnings have also been issued across part of northern England and Scotland, where the Met Office warns temperatures could reach below as -10C, and 10cm of snow could fall.\n\nIn the capital, the Met Office forecasts a maximum temperature of 8C on Monday, with lows of 2C.\n\nThe mercury is then set to drop further, with Londoners warned of a \"very cold start\" to Wednesday when temperatures could feel more like -3C.\n\nTuesday and Wednesday are forecast to bring periods of rain, sleet and light snow, before turning milder with rain and stronger winds on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for snow and ice across Scotland and England's north east coast as Arctic air moves over the country and down to northern England, possibly leading to the coldest temperatures of the year so far.\n\nThe Met Office said temperatures could drop below -10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nThe Met Office warns the cold weather could disrupt travel, with \"some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services\".\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward.\n\n\"We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly.\n\n\"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

                    "body": "A snow and ice warning has been issued for Surrey with people warned of \"difficult\" travel conditions. The Met Office's yellow weather warning will be in place from 9pm on Monday (March 6) until 10am on Tuesday (March 7.)\n\nAccording to the warning, between 1cm to 2cm of snow could settle in some areas, most likely over high ground in the Surrey area. Roads and railways are \"likely\" to be affected by the weather while injuries could occur if people fall after slipping on icy surfaces.\n\nThe Met Office alert states: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places. Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\nREAD MORE: Map shows Surrey blanketed in snow and says when it'll arrive\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nStock up food and medicine\n\nIt comes as the county was also placed under a level 2 cold weather alert, meaning there is a 60% chance of severe cold weather, ice or snow and comes with a cold weather plan for individuals. Published by the government, it offers advice for people to get through the period of cold weather, particularly those most at risk from the cold conditions.\n\nIt states: \"Prolonged periods of cold weather can be dangerous, especially for older people, those with underlying health conditions, and young children. If you're able, ask if your friends, family or neighbours need any support.\n\n\"Stock up foods and medicines so you don't have to go out too much when it's cold or icy. When indoors, stay warm, heat homes to at least 18C, and keep up-to-date with the weather forecast.\"\n\nFurther advice includes having \"regular contact\" with vulnerable people and neighbours and making sure they have access to warm food and drinks and properly heat their home. People are also warned to \"stay tuned\" to the weather forecast and to avoid exposure to the outdoors if they are at risk of cold-related illness or falls.\n\nIt comes as freezing temperatures and snow are predicted for some areas in the county over the coming weeks. For instance, in Guildford temperatures are expected to plummet to -1C early on Wednesday (March 8) with snow in the morning.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nSurrey weather: Met Office, BBC Weather and other forecasters agree when snow will fall next week\n\nHour-by-hour Surrey weather forecast after BBC predicts sleet and snow in Guildford, Farnham, and Redhill\n\nExact date Surrey towns could see heavy snowfall within next 10 days of March\n\nM25 crash with motorists 'not moving' during rush hour\n\nSuspected drink driver arrested after Surrey Police find car crashed into ditch in Lightwater",

                    "body": "A yellow weather warning for snow AND ice has been issued for Birmingham and the Midlands. The alert from forecasters at the Met Office takes hold at 9pm today - lasting til 10am on Tuesday, March 7.\n\nIn its alert, The Met Office warns: \"Ice and some snow leading to difficult travel conditions in places. Some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services. Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces.\n\n\"Probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\" A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\nREAD MORE Exact hours Birmingham will be blanketed by heavy snow and when\n\nMany areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area. The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday.\n\nAs skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces. Meteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward. We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly. Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\" Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

The weather warning is in place from 9pm this evening (March 6) and is currently due to end at 10am tomorrow (March 7).\n\nA yellow weather warning was issued for Scotland and the North East of England starting at midnight tonight and finishing at 11.59pm this evening, before another snow and ice warning begins at midnight on Wednesday for the region. Northern Ireland has also been placed under a yellow weather warning.\n\nThe snow and ice warning issued today covers much of the Midlands and extends to London and the South, as well as much of southern Wales. In the South West, it covers Bristol and Gloucestershire, and parts of Somerset and Wiltshire.\n\nRead more: Investigation launched after glass bottles allegedly thrown during Bristol City game\n\nThe Met Office says travel conditions may be poor in some areas as a result of ice ad snow. Some journeys may take longer, with roads and railways affected by the frosty weather. The forecaster also warns of potential injuries due to slips and falls on icy surfaces on some untreated roads or cycle paths.\n\nThe forecaster said: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places. Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nSouth West five-day weather forecast\n\nOften fairly cloudy today, with some showers at times.\n\nToday (Monday)\n\nOccasional bright spells are possible today, but on the whole there will be a lot of cloud around. There will also be a few showers at times. A little breezy around coasts where it will feel rather cold. Maximum temperature 8 \u00b0C.\n\nTonight\n\nPatchy cloud and scattered showers into the evening. Turning cloudier overnight with light rain developing at times, turning increasingly wintry, and falling as snow over hills. A localised frost. Minimum temperature 2 \u00b0C.\n\nTuesday\n\nRather cloudy on Tuesday with rain and sleet at times, perhaps some snow, especially over hills. Turning brighter in the afternoon, but cloud may linger across Cornwall. Feeling cold. Maximum temperature 6 \u00b0C.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday\n\nMostly cloudy on Wednesday with some rain or snow, after a frosty start. Gradually turning milder later in the week although further rain at times.

                    "body": "Some snow is forecast for the Black Country and Staffordshire this week, with the 'Beast from the East' also set to bring sub-zero temperatures in the coming days.\n\nA weather warning for snow and ice has been issued for much of the West Midlands by the Met Office from 9pm today and 10am tomorrow, with only parts in the north of Staffordshire avoiding the warning.\n\nForecasts for the coming days suggest that ice is likely to be the bigger issue in the county while the weather warning is in place.\n\nAfter a grey and cold weekend, temperatures aren't expected to climb much this week, with highs of of 7\u00b0C expected today, with tomorrow set to be slightly chillier as temperatures only forecast to reach as high as 5\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C.\n\nHowever, night-time temperatures are set to hover around freezing, or even dip below. Tonight temperatures will stay around 0\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C, but forecasters are predicting a colder Tuesday night of between -2\u00b0C and -3\u00b0C. The following night are is expected to see temperatures stay around -1\u00b0C across the region.\n\nIn its warning, which also covers the Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire, the Met Office has said: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nIn total, the weather warning runs from the western tip of South Wales, across to East Anglia, falling just short of Derby in the north and covering Winchester at its southern most point.\n\nForecasts for the Black Country and Staffordshire predict that any snow will fall on Thursday morning, with forecasts for locations such as Wolverhampton, Walsall, Dudley and Cannock all showing snow at around 9am that day.\n\nIn its forecast for the West Midlands from Wednesday to Friday, the Met Office says: \"Mostly dry with some bright weather on Wednesday, after a frosty start. Cloudier and breezier thereafter with a chance of some rain or snow. Gradually turning less cold.\"\n\nBy Sunday, daytime temperatures across the Black Country and Staffordshire are expected to hit 11\u00b0C, with overnight temperatures remaining around 6\u00b0C-7\u00b0C.\n\nFurther north, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nAs gas prices remain high, the government are reminding people of the importance of staying warm.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.\"",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice covering part of Kent. The forecasters warned of plunging temperatures ad possible snow in the county.\n\nThe yellow weather warning is in place from 9pm tonight (March 6) until 10am tomorrow (March 7). Forecasters warned: \"Ice and snow may lead to difficult travel conditions in places.\"\n\nThe weather warning covers the north of the county, including Tunbridge Wells, Maidstone, Dartford and Medway. Parts of Canterbury, Sheppey and the Weald may also see snow.\n\nRead more: ULEZ and congestion charge in London could be replaced with 'pay as you go' driving\n\nThe Met Office warns we can expect some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services. They also say there may be some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces and will probably be some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.\n\nForecast - turning cold and wintry\n\nToday: Mild in the south with bright spells and a few showers ahead of a band of rain and hill snow moving slowly southwards. Much colder weather following across northern areas with sunny spells and snow showers.\n\nTonight: Rain, sleet and snow edging slowly southwards across England and Wales, turning icy. Further snow showers affecting northern parts with some accumulations, though mostly clear and frosty well inland.\n\nTuesday : Rain, sleet and snow clearing from southern England. Many inland areas then sunny, but snow and hail showers affecting northern areas, especially north-facing coasts. Cold for all.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday: Very cold with snow showers in the north. Becoming milder in the south with rain at times, but with some snow likely here too. Occasionally windy in the south.\n\n'Give gritters space'\n\nNational Highways teams have issued a plea to motorists to give gritting vehicles time and space while they are out on the roads. A spokesman for HIghways said where conditions determine gritting vehicles need to go out, they will spread salt where needed.\n\nDarren Clark, Severe Weather Resilience Manager at National Highways, said: \"As our gritting teams go out to spread salt on the roads, our message is simple to all road users: 'Please be patient and give us the time and space to do what we need to do to keep you safe.\n\n\"If you are going to pass us, please do so courteously, pass us safely and legally, or even better, if you are able to stay back, you will actually help the salt on the road activate even more quickly by crushing and breaking it into the road surface which benefits everyone.\n\n\"It's worth remembering too, we are not gritting all the time. Some of our fleet may come off at particular junctions or return to depots while other vehicles take over, lowering any inconvenience to motorists. We are once again totally committed to working around the clock on these seasonal operations to keep all road users safe and thank everyone in advance for their patience and understanding.\"\n\nGritters have been going out whenever needed during the winter season and our teams across the country have been monitoring the Met Office weather forecasts along with regular road weather forecasts from meteorological experts MetDesk since then to determine when they need to go out to spread salt.\n\nDarren Clark said: \"Not all roads will need treating on any given day. Gritters may need to go out in some regions if road temperatures are expected to fall below +1 degrees C, and if there is a risk of ice forming, but not in other areas if conditions are not as cold.\n\n\"National Highways is committed to treating every road which needs to be treated - whenever it is needed. We are armed with the latest technology, forecasting intelligence and years of experience to help us make informed decisions about where and when we need to spread salt to help keep road users safe in even the most adverse weather conditions.\"\n\n'Increased risk of breakdowns'\n\nRAC Breakdown spokesperson Rod Dennis said: \"With a sudden switch to considerably colder conditions, the potential for vehicle breakdowns increases significantly. If a car struggles to start, the battery either needs charging - by taking it for at least a 30-minute drive - or is a sign it's about to fail and will need replacing.\n\n\"It's vital tyres have plenty of tread as good grip is essential in cold conditions. Any tyres that are well-worn and approaching the legal tread limit should be changed as a matter of urgency. Drivers should also ensure their tyres are free of damage and are inflated to the correct pressures. We also strongly recommend drivers check their cars' oil and coolant levels and top up if necessary.\"\n\nGet more news from KentLive straight to your inbox for free HERE .\n\nREAD NEXT",

Whilst the highest accumulations of 5-10 cm are most likely over northern Scotland, there is a small chance of more organised and persistent spells of snow developing elsewhere in this area, and could bring 2 to 5 cm even at lower levels. Into Monday night, showers are expected to continue, and ice is likely to form on untreated surfaces where snow has melted by day.\"\n\nOn Monday morning The Met Office update read: \"Warning extended into Wednesday morning to account for threat of snow/ice continuing into early Wednesday.\"",

A band of rain and hill snow will move southwards during Monday, perhaps bringing some snow to low levels for a time overnight into Tuesday for central, eastern and south-eastern England.\n\n\"To the north of this band frequent snow showers will affect north-east England during Monday and Tuesday, with icy stretches developing. Another spell of rain, sleet and snow is likely for southern parts of England during Wednesday, then central and northern England are at risk of seeing periods of snow on Thursday and Friday.\"",

The Met Office has acted as forecasts show snow heading to the county overnight.\n\nThere could be some difficult driving conditions as the white stuff falls. The yellow severe weather warning says roads and railways could be affected with longer journey times on public transport as well.\n\nPedestrians and cyclists will need to be aware of the risks of falls and slips on icy surfaces across the county. It comes as cold Arctic air moves south across the UK.\n\nREAD MORE: Met Office maps track snow over Gloucestershire within hours in new timeline verdict\n\nWhat to expect Some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces Probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths\n\nA warning message from the Met Office reads: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places. Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nMore details as we get them.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nIncoming: Weather maps show snow sweeping across county Road reopens with a brand new look 'Panther' caught on camera in field by A40 Road diversion to send drivers though some of the county's busiest roads Iconic bar hosting after parties throughout Cheltenham Festival 2023",

                    "body": "A yellow weather warning for snow and ice across Essex has been issued by the Met Office. Snow is forecast for various parts of Essex over the coming days.\n\nThe warning comes into force at 9pm on Monday (March 6) and will run until 10am on Tuesday (March 7). The Met Office says people might notice disruption on some roads due to difficult traffic conditions.\n\nIcy patches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths could increase the possibility of injuries from slips and falls. The Met Office say rain will travel southwards through Monday night and early Tuesday, turning to snow on hills and some lower levels in places.\n\nREAD MORE: Exact time snow could fall in Essex this week as forecasters predict wintery temperatures\n\nThey add: \"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area. The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nThe weather warning comes as the Government issues a cold weather alert covering Essex this week.. The alert, which covers all of England, comes into force from Monday with people encouraged to look out for vulnerable people. The Met Office and UKHSA are warning that all of England will experience cold weather from 1am on Monday (March 6) to midnight on Wednesday (March 8).\n\nAccording to the Met Office, there will be a light sprinkling of sleet in Brentwood from 3am on Tuesday (March 7). This could convert to snowfall a few hours later with a 40 per cent chance of snow at 6am.\n\nSnow is also forecast for Chelmsford (between 3am and 6am), Southend (4am to 7am), and Colchester (2am to 5am).\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health. If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nEssex man appears in court charged with murdering his wife in Clacton home\n\nFace of man who 'brazenly targeted women' to commit sexual offences on buses\n\nLeigh-on-Sea pensioner reunited with long-lost sister after 70 years apart\n\nNicola Bulley: William de Ferrers school pays tribute to Essex-raised mum after police confirm her body was discovered\n\nSister hopes that Essex man missing in Nepal for 20 years may still be alive",

                    "body": "Some snow is forecast for Shropshire this week, with the 'Beast from the East' also set to bring sub-zero temperatures in the coming days.\n\nA weather warning for snow and ice has been issued for much of Shropshire by the Met Office from 9pm today and 10am tomorrow, but stops short of towns in the north of the county such as Oswestry and Wem.\n\nForecasts for the coming days suggest that ice is likely to be the bigger issue in the county while the weather warning is in place.\n\nAfter a grey and cold weekend, temperatures aren't expected to climb much this week, with highs of of 7\u00b0C expected today, with tomorrow set to be slightly chillier as temperatures only forecast to reach as high as 5\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C.\n\nHowever, night-time temperatures are set to hover around freezing, or even dip below. Tonight temperatures will stay around 0\u00b0C and 1\u00b0C, but forecasters are predicting a very cold Tuesday night of between -3\u00b0C and -5\u00b0C. The following nights are also expected to see temperatures stay around -1\u00b0C across Shropshire.\n\nIn its warning, which also covers the Black Country, Staffordshire, Powys, Herefordshire and Worcestershire, the Met Office has said: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area.\n\n\"The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nIn total, the weather warning runs from the western tip of South Wales, across to East Anglia, falling just short of Derby in the north and covering Winchester at its southern most point.\n\nForecasts for Shropshire predict that any snow in the county will fall in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nAcross the county, from Whitchurch and Oswestry, down through Telford and Shrewsbury and on to Bridgnorth and Ludlow, forecasters are expecting some snowfall between 3am and 9am, although in some places this is due to be accompanied by rain.\n\nIn its forecast for the West Midlands from Wednesday to Friday, the Met Office says: \"Mostly dry with some bright weather on Wednesday, after a frosty start. Cloudier and breezier thereafter with a chance of some rain or snow. Gradually turning less cold.\"\n\nBy Sunday, daytime temperatures across Shropshire are expected to hit 12\u00b0C, with overnight temperatures remaining around 6\u00b0C-7\u00b0C.\n\nFurther north, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nAs gas prices remain high, the government are reminding people of the importance of staying warm.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.\"",

                    "body": "Snow is being forecast in parts of Gloucestershire this week by BBC Weather. It adds weight to forecasts from the Met Office that the white stuff is due to fall as a cold blast brings a wintry feel to what should be that start of spring.\n\nAs well as the risk of snow and sleet, temperatures are set to plunge below-freezing overnight this week before the mercury starts to rise at the weekend. A Cold Weather Alert is in place for Gloucestershire and England while severe weather warnings for snow and ice are in force for parts of Scotland and North-East England today.\n\nLooking at the wider UK picture, BBC Weather says 'wintry precipitation' is due before midweek while there is a lot of uncertainty looking into next week. It says the most intense will be on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.\n\nREAD MORE: Incoming: Weather maps show snow sweeping across county\n\nBBC Gloucestershire snow forecast\n\nStow : Tuesday light snow from 6am to 9am; Thursday light snow from 4am to 9am\n\nColeford : Tuesday, light snow from 6am to 10am; Thursday: light snow from midnight to 8am\n\nTewkesbury : Light snow on Thursday from midnight to 6am\n\nGloucester : Light snow from midnight to 4am on Thursday\n\nCheltenham : Light snow from midnight to 5am on Thursday\n\nStroud : Thursday, light snow from 1am to 6am\n\nUK weather outlook\n\nArctic air moving over the country and down to northern England could lead to the coldest temperature of the year so far. The Met Office said temperatures could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said. All areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow warning starting at 6pm on Sunday for snow in the north-east of Scotland, including Shetland. It advises this could cause disruption to travel, with \"some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services\".\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly. Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year.\n\n\"The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that. We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nIncoming: Weather maps show snow sweeping across county Road reopens with a brand new look 'Panther' caught on camera in field by A40 Road diversion to send drivers though some of the county's busiest roads Iconic bar hosting after parties throughout Cheltenham Festival 2023",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued a snow and ice warning for a large part of Wales. A band of rain is likely to turn to snow overnight on Monday meaning the Tuesday morning commute could be difficult.\n\nThe yellow alert is in place from 9pm on Monday until 10am on Tuesday.\n\nIt says: \"A band of rain will edge southwards through the course of Monday evening and early Tuesday, this rain turning to snow on hills and perhaps to lower levels in places.\n\n\"Many areas will see little or no accumulations of snow, but 1 to 2 cm could settle in some spots, most likely over high ground and southern parts of the warning area. The rain and snow is then expected to turn light and patchy as it slowly clears southern England on Tuesday. As skies clear overnight, ice is also likely to form readily on untreated surfaces.\"\n\nThere has been speculation for days that Arctic winds could bring snow to large parts of the UK.\n\nThe areas covered by the warning in Wales are:\n\nBlaenau Gwent Bridgend Caerphilly Cardiff Carmarthenshire Ceredigion Merthyr Tydfil Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot Newport Pembrokeshire Powys Rhondda Cynon Taf Swansea Torfaen Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nThe northerly airflow will sweep across the UK at the start of this and the Met Office says the introduction of an arctic maritime airmass will bring snow showers from Monday.\n\nDeputy Chief Meteorologist, Chris Almond, said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week. This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"",

                    "body": "BRITS have been warned of travel chaos with the Met Office issuing a yellow weather warning for snow and ice today.\n\nForecasters have warned the northeast of England, Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland are at risk of the white stuff from today until Wednesday.\n\nScotland could even see up to 4 inches of snow in northern areas.\n\nThe warnings will last for up to three days and may disrupt travel across the country.\n\nThe Met Office warns: \"Snow showers are likely to cause some disruption to travel with a small chance of more widespread disruption for some.\n\n\"There is a small chance of travel delays on roads with some stranded vehicles and passengers, along with delayed or cancelled rail and air travel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, snow showers are set to hit Scotland, Northern Ireland and the east coast of England.\n\nDeputy Chief Meteorologist Chris Almond, said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week.\"\n\nHe added: \"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nThe Met warned: \"There is a slight chance that some rural communities could become cut off.\"\n\nAlso, the Met warned: \"There is a small chance that power cuts will occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected.\"\n\nThe Met has urged people in affected areas to take care as there is a small chance of injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces.\n\nThe Met Office earlier issued a yellow warning starting at 6pm on Sunday for snow in the north-east of Scotland, including Shetland.\n\nNorthern Ireland will be affected too.\n\nThe Met said: \"Some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services.\"\n\nThere is a risk of \"some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces,\" the Met added.\n\nThere may also be \"some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths\" in Northern Ireland, the Met Office said.\n\nFrom Tuesday it expands further south across the Humber into Lincolnshire, as well as up into North-West Scotland.\n\nIt comes as forecasters expect the weather to turn cold as an area of high pressure moves off to the West and cold air from the North sweeps in, with Met Office maps forecasting temperatures will tumble as low as -3C in Altnaharra, northern Scotland on Monday night.",

                    "body": "Yellow warnings for snow have been issued across part of northern England and Scotland, where the Met Office warns temperatures could reach below as -10C, and 10cm of snow could fall.\n\nIn the capital, the Met Office forecasts a maximum temperature of 8C on Monday, with lows of 2C.\n\nThe mercury is then set to drop to a low of 0C on Wednesday, when Londoners are warned of a \"very cold start\" and temperatures could feel more like -3C.\n\nWednesday is forecast to bring periods of rain, sleet and light snow, before turning milder with rain and stronger winds on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for snow and ice across Scotland and England's north east coast as Arctic air moves over the country and down to northern England, possibly leading to the coldest temperatures of the year so far.\n\nThe Met Office said temperatures could drop below -10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nThe Met Office warns the cold weather could disrupt travel, with \"some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services\".\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward.\n\n\"We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly.\n\n\"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

                    "body": "The Met Office has provided the latest weather outlook for Nottingham as parts of the UK brace for what could be the coldest temperatures of the year. The forecaster said temperatures could drop below -10C (14F) on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels. Meanwhile, the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for snow in the northeast of Scotland, including Shetland. However, conditions in Nottingham are expected to be much milder, with temperatures expected to reach 7C on Monday, March 6.\n\nBut temperatures are predicted to dip below freezing in the early hours of Wednesday, hitting as low as -3c from 3am to 6am. The Met Office outlook for the East Midlands for the latter part of the week reads: \"Very cold, with severe frosts overnight. Wednesday largely dry with bright or sunny spells at first, then increasingly cloudy, with periods of rain and snow possible Thursday and Friday.\"\n\nPoll: Are you worried about the number of empty shops in Nottingham city centre?\n\nYellow warnings of snow and ice also cover northwestern England and northeastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday. Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nBBC forecasters had predicted snow could hits Notts on Tuesday.\n\nRead next:\n\nNew traders in as unique shop bounces back from liquidation Part of the city centre where a number of shops have closed Gym demolition in restoration of railway station with rich history Life in the Nottinghamshire village that is 'so unique' it attracts shoppers from across county 'Mid-range hotel' among calls for city's former Debenhams building",

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for parts of north-east Scotland and England for today (March 6) and the rest of the week.\n\nMeteorologist Craig Snell said around eight inches could fall on high ground and as much as 10cm could settle on low-lying areas. The weather could disrupt travel and other day-to-day activities, it has been revealed.\n\nRead more: Exact hours Birmingham will be blanketed by heavy snow and when\n\nToday's warning has encompassed Scotland and north-east England that extends to Newcastle upon Tyne and Yorkshire. But will spread to the Midlands, Yorkshire and southern regions on Tuesday (March 7).\n\nThe Met Office said snow could cause delays on roads in these places, as well as rail and plane cancellations. It also warned of the risk of slips and falls on icy surfaces.\n\nThere was 'slight chance' that rural communities could be cut off, it said, adding that cuts to power and phone services were possible.",

The weather system will bring the threat of sleet and snow in the Midlands and southern England later in the week.\n\nThe Met Office has already warned of the risk of travel disruption in areas affected by snow with roads and railways expected to be icy.\n\nA light dusting of snow covered the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire this morning.

Below freezing temperatures predicted to continue until March 11 at least amid a Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event.\n\nThe risk of snow further south into England will grow from tomorrow. It might only start feeling milder in southern England from Friday but areas further north could stay chilly until into next week.\n\nMet Office forecaster Craig Snell said the air was 'coming pretty much straight from the Arctic, which is especially cold at this time of year'.\n\nHe added: 'I would imagine you will see some sleet or snow in the south of England, even if it doesn't cause any great disruption.\n\n'But we are keeping a close eye on it.'\n\nThe yellow weather warning, which started at 6pm yesterday, extends to Wednesday.

Pictured: Commuters in the rain and freezing temperatures this morning\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has urged people to look out for those most at risk from cold weather such as those with medical conditions or aged over 65.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa advised: 'During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n'If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.'\n\nThe plunging temperatures are the latest cold snap to hit the UK as it battles with soaring energy bills during the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThe UKHSA said for those struggling with the rising costs, it provides free advice on energy efficiency and national grants to help warm homes.\n\nIt advised that wearing several layers of thinner clothing will keep people warmer than wearing one thick layer, and that consuming hot food and drinks is also effective.\n\nIt comes after Provisional Met Office figures also showed that England had its driest February in 30 years.\n\nThe United Kingdom as a whole had less than half the monthly average rainfall, at 45 per cent, with 43.4mm falling.",

                    "body": "The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for snow and ice for some parts of the UK as a big freeze sweeps across England, Scotland and Wales. Many people have woken up to freezing temperatures on Monday morning and the Met Office is warning more cold weather is to come.\n\nA weather warning is in place for today and tomorrow covering large parts of England and Scotland as a result of arctic air disrupting travel and day-to-day activities.\n\nA Met Office meteorlogist said up to 20cm of snow could fall on high ground, with up to 10cm not out of the picture in low-lying regions, including Newcastle upon Tyne and Yorkshire.\n\nIn the South West, the Met Office is forecasting 'increasingly wintry' weather overnight, with snow settling on the hills and localised frost. They say on Tuesday there could be sleet and \"at times, perhaps some snow\" despite things \"turning brighter\" in the afternoon.\n\nIn Plymouth, temperatures should not get below freezing overnight but it will feel chilly with some rain forecast on Tuesday. The Met Office says the outlook is for grey and drizzly weather for the rest of the week, with max temperatures of 6C on Tuesday and 7C on Wednesday.\n\nWhere a weather warning is in place in northern England and Scotland, the Met Office is warning of travel disruptuon and that some \"rural communities could become cut off\".\n\nAdditionally, it adds: \"There is a small chance that power cuts will occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected. A band of rain, sleet and snow is expected to move south during Monday followed by frequent snow and hail showers.\"\n\nMet Office deputy chief meteorologist Chris Almond, told the Mirror: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week. This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels. With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time. So keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nRead next: Plymouth schoolboy 'killed by parked car struck by e-vehicle'\n\nMet Office long-range forecast\n\nFriday 10 Mar - Sunday 19 Mar\n\nConfidence remains low throughout this period. On Friday, very cold conditions are expected across the far north, accompanied by snow showers, although some sunny spells are possible away from any showers. Elsewhere, milder, cloudier conditions are likely, with outbreaks of rain and some stronger winds possible. There is a small chance of more disruptive snowfall, particularly over hills. Into the weekend, milder conditions are expected to spread northeastwards, bringing rain and stronger winds, as well as some snow along the leading edge. Towards the end of the period, this transition is expected to continue, bringing some more unsettled conditions. Periods of snow remain possible, particularly in the far north. Temperatures generally below average, but may gradually turn milder into the end of the period.\n\nMonday 20 Mar - Monday 3 Apr\n\nConfidence remains very low during this period. It's likely to be drier further north apart from occasional wintry showers, while rain and strong winds are more likely in the south, with a lower risk of snow at times. These milder conditions may extend north periodically, but it's possible that the cold but bright weather could return south to all parts through late March, bringing a return to drier conditions to the south. Temperatures will likely fluctuate between cold and mild, north to south, but will probably average out around normal.\n\nMet Office South West forecast\n\nToday:\n\nOccasional bright spells are possible today, but on the whole there will be a lot of cloud around. There will also be a few showers at times. A little breezy around coasts where it will feel rather cold. Maximum temperature 8 \u00b0C.\n\nTonight:\n\nPatchy cloud and scattered showers into the evening. Turning cloudier overnight with light rain developing at times, turning increasingly wintry, and falling as snow over hills. A localised frost. Minimum temperature 2 \u00b0C.\n\nTuesday:\n\nRather cloudy on Tuesday with rain and sleet at times, perhaps some snow, especially over hills. Turning brighter in the afternoon, but cloud may linger across Cornwall. Feeling cold. Maximum temperature 6 \u00b0C.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday:\n\nMostly cloudy on Wednesday with some rain or snow, after a frosty start. Gradually turning milder later in the week although further rain at times. Often rather windy.\n\nLevel three alert for some\n\nTwo UK Health Security Agency warnings are also in force in North East England, the North West and Yorkshire under a level three alert, while the rest of England is at level two.\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health. If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nRead next:\n\nArmed police arrest man arrested and seize knife after teen girl allegedly assaulted Tom Daley wants more kids with husband Dustin Lance Black 22 Plymouth business men and women banned from running a company Plymouth pubs bucking national trends because they're simply magic The day a Spanish princess accidentally arrived in Plymouth instead of Southampton for her wedding",

Temperatures are expected to drop to as low as -5C tomorrow, with rain and snow predicted to follow.\n\nWednesday is predicted to have some sunny spells, though don't expect much warmth from the sunshine as there are highs of just 3C, while lows are expected to fall below zero to -1C\n\nOn Thursday however Stokies may wake up to snow. Snowfall is forecast to begin very early on on Thursday morning at around 3am. This is set to continue throughout Thursday, with some light rain also predicted.\n\nREAD MORE: Cold weather alert issued as Stoke-on-Trent braced for wintry blast\n\nBut the Staffordshire Moorlands around Leek can expect snow a little sooner, with today looking to be an extremely mixed bag. Highs of 5C and lows of -1C are predicted, along with sunny spells, some rain, and some snow forecast towards the evening.\n\nThis will continue later in the week when there is more snow expected on Thursday both on the Moorlands and across Stoke-on-Trent. There will also be sub-zero temperatures, so people are advised to wrap up warm and check on loved ones during the cold snap.\n\nSome areas of the UK including the Midlands also have yellow weather warnings in place for snow and ice. This will be in effect in impacted areas until tomorrow.\n\nChris Almond, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"Although we've moved into meteorological spring there will be a distinctly wintry feel to our weather next week. Very cold air will spread across the UK bringing snow showers even to sea level in the north on Monday and these snow showers could spread further south on Tuesday.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, it is likely weather warnings will be issued for Monday and Tuesday once the detail of potential impacts becomes clearer, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nNew blow as Hays Travel becomes latest chain to quit Newcastle\n\nStoke pub popular with football fans undergoes \u00a3130k refurb - and now has a new name\n\n'Bubbly' nightclub shot girl dies in 3am drink-drive crash\n\nFry-up fans' fury after guest served this Alton Towers breakfast\n\n'Heartbreak' as Midlands 'Mad Dog' Jeremy Kyle guest dies",

                    "body": "Wintery weather conditions could be on their way back for residents in Essex as a dip in temperatures is forecast for the coming days. The experts' prediction for snow comes as the Government issues a cold weather alert covering Essex this week.\n\nThe alert, which covers all of England, comes into force from Monday with people encouraged to look out for vulnerable people. The Met Office and UKHSA are warning that all of England will experience cold weather from 1am on Monday (March 6) to midnight on Wednesday (March 8).\n\nThey claim that cold air will spread across the country with snow showers expected north. Snow could then head further south due to gusts of wind.\n\nREAD MORE: The Essex towns which the Elizabeth Line could visit according to council plans\n\nAccording to the Met Office, there will be a light sprinkling of sleet in Brentwood from 3am on Tuesday (March 7). This could convert to snowfall a few hours later with a 40 per cent chance of snow at 6am.\n\nForecasts previously said areas of Chelmsford, Harwich and Harlow could see a mix of snowfall and rain from 6am on Tuesday, with temperatures dropping to around 3C. A sprinkling of wet weather in the hours before snowfall means it is unlikely to settle and result in any major disruption, but cold temperatures could make it important for motorists to check their routes and plan accordingly before setting off to work.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.\"\n\nChris Almond, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"Although we've moved into meteorological spring there will be a distinctly wintry feel to our weather next week. Very cold air will spread across the UK bringing snow showers even to sea level in the north on Monday and these snow showers could spread further south on Tuesday.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, it is likely weather warnings will be issued for Monday and Tuesday once the detail of potential impacts becomes clearer, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nEssex man appears in court charged with murdering his wife in Clacton home\n\nFace of man who 'brazenly targeted women' to commit sexual offences on buses\n\nLeigh-on-Sea pensioner reunited with long-lost sister after 70 years apart\n\nNicola Bulley: William de Ferrers school pays tribute to Essex-raised mum after police confirm her body was discovered\n\nSister hopes that Essex man missing in Nepal for 20 years may still be alive",

                    "body": "The country is preparing for another arctic snap this week as meteorologists warned to brace for the coldest day of the year so far.\n\nTemperatures are due to plummet across the UK, as the Met Office issued a yellow warning of snow for some parts of the North of England in the coming days.\n\nIt seems that whilst Greater Manchester will narrowly miss out on snowfall, freezing conditions and minus temperatures are likely to be felt across the region.\n\nREAD MORE: The chances of snow in Greater Manchester as UK braces for coldest day of year\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and placed north-west England and Yorkshire under a level 3 alert, meaning there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable people. The rest of the UK has been placed under level 2.\n\nTemperatures could drop as low -4 degrees celsius in parts of Greater Manchester on Tuesday night, with the forecast unlikely to get far above freezing over the coming days.\n\nA yellow warning of snow has been issued by the Met Office for snow and ice in parts of North Yorkshire, Northumbria, and Scotland.\n\nHere is the weather forecast for Greater Manchester this week.\n\nMonday\n\nPatchy cloud and showers through the morning, the showers perhaps wintry in places, especially over the hills. Turning brighter into the afternoon with a mix of sunny spells and some snow showers.\n\nFeeling particularly cold around the coast, where breezy. Maximum temperature 7 \u00b0C. Minimum overnight temperature -1 \u00b0C.\n\nTuesday\n\nAfter a frosty start, a bright day with plenty of sunshine though remaining chilly. Breezy near to the coast, and a chance of the odd snow shower developing here too. Maximum temperature 6 \u00b0C. Minimum overnight temperature -4\u00b0C.\n\nWednesday\n\nMostly dry with some sunshine on Wednesday, after a frosty start. Cloudier and breezier thereafter with a chance of some rain or snow. Gradually turning less cold.\n\nMaximum day time temperature 3\u00b0C and minimum temperature overnight expected to be around -2\u00b0C.\n\nThursday\n\nCloudier and breezier thereafter with a chance of some rain or snow. Gradually turning less cold. Maximum day time temperature 4\u00b0C and minimum night time temperature 0\u00b0C.\n\nFriday - Sunday\n\nOn Friday, very cold conditions are expected across the far north, accompanied by snow showers, although some sunny spells are possible away from any showers.\n\nElsewhere, milder, cloudier conditions are likely, with outbreaks of rain and some stronger winds possible. There is a small chance of more disruptive snowfall, particularly over hills.\n\nInto the weekend, milder conditions are expected to spread northeastwards, bringing rain and stronger winds, as well as some snow along the leading edge.\n\nTowards the end of the period, this transition is expected to continue, bringing some more unsettled conditions. Periods of snow remain possible, particularly in the far north.\n\nTemperatures generally below average, but may gradually turn milder into the end of the period.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\n'It used to be beautiful': The Curry Mile restaurateurs who say it's 'gone so downhill'\n\nTorment of wife of missing dad as trolls and 'social media detectives fuel speculation'\n\nBoy, 15, in a serious condition after stabbing outside McDonalds\n\n'The man was a legend' - Tributes paid to man who died after being hit by digger at industrial estate\n\nThe pretty village with no shops and one pub an hour from Greater Manchester",

                    "body": "The UK is set for the coldest day of the year today with snow and ice to hit parts of the north including Scotland.\n\nAn arctic blast will mean up to 20cm (4in) of snow could fall on high ground, with up to 10cm possible in low-lying regions, according to forecasters.\n\nIt will feel as cold as -4C in parts of the UK as a front of cold air works its way down the country, bringing the threat of sleet and snow in the Midlands and southern England later in the week.\n\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice in parts of Scotland and northern England as temperatures are set to plummet.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and placed north-west England and Yorkshire under a level 3 alert.\n\nThis means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable people. The rest of the UK has been placed under level 2.\n\nThe forecaster has already warned of the risk of travel disruption in areas affected by snow with roads and railways expected to be icy.\n\nYellow weather warnings are in place from today till late tomorrow across northern Scotland and north-east England, as well as parts of Yorkshire and the Humber, and Lincolnshire.\n\nThe weather warning, which started at 6pm on Sunday, extends to just before midnight tomorrow and covers the northern part of Scotland, including Aberdeen and Inverness.\n\nTemperatures are likely to stay far below average for early spring for much of the week.\n\nBelow-freezing temperatures are predicted to continue until Saturday, at least amid a Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event.\n\nCraig Snell, a senior meteorologist at the Met Office, said: 'Going into next week we do see a bit of a change with even colder air coming through and then an increase in risk of sudden disruption due to some sleet, snow and some ice.\n\nHe added that the Met Office yellow warnings were unlikely to change.\n\nHe said: 'Scotland and some eastern parts of England have warnings going throughout Monday and Tuesday. In other parts of the country - we are keeping a close eye on it - there is a chance that we could see some snow further south as we kind of go through the week ahead.'\n\nAgostinho Sousa, the head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: 'During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n'If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.'\n\nBBC forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas said that tomorrow night could be the coldest of the week and one of the coldest of the year, with lows of -10C (14F) possible in Scotland.\n\nShe added that it was 'not too unusual' to get these 'cold wintry blasts' even after entering meteorological spring, due to the effects of air from the Arctic.\n\nBut the forecast for the middle of the week is less certain, with the arrival of warmer air from the Atlantic expected to create a 'battleground' over the UK, she said.\n\nShe said this could bring snow to more southerly parts of England, or some much-needed rain following a dry six-week period.",

                    "body": "Many are waking up this morning to freezing temperatures as thousands have been told to brace for snow today.\n\nThe Met Office has put a yellow weather warning for snow and ice warning for today and tomorrow covering large parts of Scotland and England.\n\nIt warns of travel chaos as snow showers may cause more widespread disruption for some and that some \"rural communities could become cut off\".\n\nAdditionally, it adds: \"There is a small chance that power cuts will occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected. A band of rain, sleet and snow is expected to move south during Monday followed by frequent snow and hail showers.\"\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Chris Almond, said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week. This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time. So keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nRead our weather live blog below...\n\n07:59Alahna KindredWhere are the weather warnings for today?\n\nRegions and local authorities affected:\n\nCentral, Tayside & Fife\n\nAngusDundeeFifePerth and Kinross\n\nGrampian\n\nAberdeenAberdeenshireMoray\n\nHighlands & Eilean Siar\n\nNa h-Eileanan SiarHighland\n\nNorth East England\n\nDarlingtonDurhamGatesheadHartlepoolMiddlesbroughNewcastle upon TyneNorth TynesideNorthumberlandRedcar and ClevelandSouth TynesideStockton-on-TeesSunderland\n\nOrkney & Shetland\n\nOrkney IslandsShetland Islands\n\nSW Scotland, Lothian Borders\n\nEast LothianMidlothian CouncilScottish Borders\n\nYorkshire & Humber\n\nNorth Yorkshire\n\n07:57Alahna KindredWhat is the Met Office saying?\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Chris Almond, said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week.\n\n\"This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time.\n\n\"So keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nThis was the snowfall in Northumberland in December 2022 (Image:PA)",

                    "body": "The latest cold snap sees UK weather maps showing areas across Britain where there is a 90 per cent chance of snow today.\n\nThe Met Office had previously predicted light snow next week however there wasn't any clarity on when the snow would actually arrive. Snow and ice weather warnings have been issues by The Met Office for both March 6 and 7 across Scotland and the North of England.\n\nThe WXCharts, an independent forecaster, is now showing snow will hit 90 per cent of the UK over the next 24 hours.\n\nRead next Updates as seven car crash between M3 and M25 causes chaos near Thorpe Park\n\nWhile the snow starts up North, the Midlands and Wales will most likely see snow by this evening. London could see snow in the early hours of Tuesday morning expected to continue until the afternoon according to the WXCharts. The Met Office however is forecasting rain across London on March 6 and then in the early hours of March 7, with temperatures expecting to warm up in the afternoon.\n\nAcross the country, temperatures will be dropping with a cold burst of northerly winds. Deputy Chief Meteorologist, Chris Almond, said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday [March 5] through early next week.\"\n\n\"This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\"\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time.So keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nLondon's weather forecast for the rest of the week can be found below.\n\nToday:\n\nCloudy with a band of mainly light rain moving eastwards this morning. Some brighter spells are possible this afternoon, along with some showers, before cloud thickens again this evening. An increasing breeze means it will feel cold. Maximum temperature 8 \u00b0C.\n\nTonight:\n\nOutbreaks of rain this evening and overnight, turning wintry over hills and perhaps to lower levels later, with slight accumulations and some icy patches developing in places by morning. Minimum temperature 0 \u00b0C.\n\nTuesday:\n\nThicker cloud, rain and snow will clear southwards during the morning, allowing bright or sunny spells to develop from the north. Remaining cold. Maximum temperature 5 \u00b0C.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday:\n\nA very cold start Wednesday, then increasingly cloudy, with periods of rain, sleet and snow possible. Turning milder with rain and stronger winds Thursday and Friday.\n\nWant more from MyLondon?

                    "body": "Scotland is set to experience its second day of wintry weather as a yellow warning for snow and ice hits parts of the country.\n\nIt comes after a yellow weather warning for snow was issued for Sunday for parts of the Highlands, Aberdeenshire, Moray, Angus and Shetland.\n\nMonday's warning came into effect at midnight, with the wintry weather also expected to hit Tayside, Perth and Kinross, Fife, the Western Isles, Orkney, East Lothian, Midlothian and the Scottish Borders.\n\nUp to 10cm of snow is expected to fall in some areas, which could turn to ice later in the day.\n\nForecasters warned that some rural communities could be cut off and power cuts and mobile signal could be affected by the weather.\n\nMotorists have been urged to take care on roads amid warnings the weather could impact rail and air travel.\n\nMeanwhile STV meteorologist Sean Batty warned temperatures could drop as low as -15C in the coming days.\n\n\"Overnight we will see a cold front moving south across the country bringing with it showers and also some strengthening winds, so those showers will be quite blustery and increasingly turning to snow through the night. We can expect to see 2 to 5cm falling in some spots within the warning area.\n\n\"We'll have similar conditions over the first two days of the working week, with further snow showers spilling in from the north on this bitterly cold northerly airflow. Only a handful of those showers will filter further south of the country, and any that do will not be as heavy as those expected in the north.\n\n\"By Tuesday and Wednesday the majority of the snow showers will become confined to northern coastal parts with central and southern inland areas seeing brighter and drier days ahead - but still feeling very wintry.\"",

A family is pictured walking in the snow near Tomintoul yesterday\n\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice in parts of Scotland and northern England for today (left) and tomorrow (right) as temperatures plummet to -4C\n\nIt will feel as cold as -4C in parts of the UK as a front of Arctic air works its way down the country. Pictured: London Bridge this morning\n\nVentusky Privacy Policy\n\nYellow weather warnings are in place from today to late tomorrow across northern Scotland and north-east England, as well as parts of Yorkshire and the Humber, and Lincolnshire.\n\nHigh ground areas of northern Scotland can expect the most snowfall, possibly reaching depths of four inches.\n\nThe weather warning, which started at 6pm on Sunday, extends to just before midnight tomorrow and covers the northern part of Scotland, including Aberdeen and Inverness.\n\nTemperatures are likely to stay far below average for early spring for much of the week. Below freezing temperatures predicted to continue until March 11 at least amid a Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event.\n\nThe risk of snow further south into England will grow from tomorrow. It might only start feeling milder in southern England from Friday but areas further north could stay chilly until into next week.\n\nMet Office forecaster Craig Snell said the air was 'coming pretty much straight from the Arctic, which is especially cold at this time of year'.\n\nHe added: 'I would imagine you will see some sleet or snow in the south of England, even if it doesn't cause any great disruption.\n\n'But we are keeping a close eye on it.'\n\nA yellow weather warning is issued when there is a small chance of travel delays, minor injuries due to ice, power cuts, and the cutting off of rural areas.

Pictured: Commuters around London Bridge this morning\n\nA car in the snow near Tomintoul, a village in Scotland, on Sunday. A Met Office yellow warning for snow comes into force at 6pm\n\nParts of England could also be in for cold and snowy weather this week (Pictured Stoke-on-Trent during the January cold snap this year)\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has urged people to look out for those most at risk from cold weather such as those with medical conditions or aged over 65.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa advised: 'During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n'If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.'\n\nThe plunging temperatures are the latest cold snap to hit the UK as it battles with soaring energy bills during the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThe UKHSA said for those struggling with the rising costs, it provides free advice on energy efficiency and national grants to help warm homes.\n\nIt advised that wearing several layers of thinner clothing will keep people warmer than wearing one thick layer, and that consuming hot food and drinks is also effective.\n\nIt comes after Provisional Met Office figures also showed that England had its driest February in 30 years.\n\nThe United Kingdom as a whole had less than half the monthly average rainfall, at 45 per cent, with 43.4mm falling.",

                    "body": "An Arctic airmass will bring below-freezing temperatures, ice and the risk of snow to many parts of the country this week, the Met Office is warning.\n\nA cold weather alert is in place from this morning (Monday) thanks to the arrival of a northerly airflow which is drawing icy air from the Arctic across England that could lead to widespread 'disruptive conditions'.\n\nYellow weather warnings for ice and snow have already been issued for northern and eastern areas with early forecasts suggesting that - alongside freezing temperatures for all parts of the country - the very worst of the weather could then track further south.\n\nDeputy Chief Meteorologist, Chris Almond, said: \"Very cold air will spread across the UK through early next week. This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nForecasters have been watching weather models closely since it emerged that a weather system known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming - which brought England the Beast from the East in 2018 - had occurred again at the end of February triggering the possibility for more winter storms in the following fortnight.\n\nLevel 2 and Level 3 cold weather alerts - which come jointly from the Met Office and UK Health Security Agency - have been issued across England for the start of the week and will be both reviewed, and possibly extended in the coming days.\n\nThe early warnings help organisations like the NHS and local councils organise in advance how they can ensure those vulnerable to the cold, such as the homeless or elderly, are properly taken care of.\n\nNationally, there are thousands of excess winter deaths every year caused by the cold and the alerts trigger actions across the NHS, public health, social care and other community organisations, to support vulnerable people with health issues that can be made worse in wintry weather.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in with friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.\"",

Arctic winds that feel like -4C will move from the north to the south.\n\nSome areas in Scotland may already be experiencing snowfall this morning.\n\nA yellow warning is in place for much of Scotland and the north-east of England, with the Met Office warning: \"Snow showers are likely to cause some disruption to travel with a small chance of more widespread disruption for some.\"\n\nWeather maps have predicted snow to fall across the UK ( Image: WXCharts)\n\nThe likelihood of more snow over the next few days is extremely high, with snow maps service WXCharts predicting the chance of it snowing over the next 24 hours is up to 90%, with all areas across the UK affected, apart from a few parts of the south.\n\nNorthern Scotland could see up to 19cm of snow in Inverness and nearby areas.\n\nThe north of England is expected to be hit by severe conditions especially, with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issuing a cold weather alert at level three for north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire until 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nSome areas of the UK are expected to come to a standstill, with the Met Office issuing yellow warnings for most of Scotland and the north of England for Monday and Tuesday, with potential disruptions expected.\n\nThe Met Office have issued a yellow weather warning for parts of Scotland and the north of England ( Image: Met Office)\n\nCommuters should plan for journeys to take longer than usual, as roads and railways are expected to be impacted by the snow.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nSenior meteorologist Craig Snell said: \"We do see a bit of a change with even colder air coming through and then an increase in risk of sudden disruption due to some sleet, snow and some ice.\"\n\nUK 5 day weather forecast Snowfall is expected to 'blanket' roads and railway lines ( Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\nToday:\n\nMild in the south with bright spells and a few showers ahead of a band of rain and hill snow moving slowly southwards. Much colder weather following across northern areas with sunny spells and snow showers.\n\nTonight:\n\nRain, sleet and snow edging slowly southwards across England and Wales, turning icy. Further snow showers affecting northern parts with some accumulations, though mostly clear and frosty well inland.\n\nTuesday:\n\nRain, sleet and snow clearing from southern England. Many inland areas then sunny, but snow and hail showers affecting northern areas, especially north-facing coasts. Cold for all.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday:\n\nVery cold with snow showers in the north. Becoming milder in the south with rain at times, but with some snow likely here too. Occasionally windy in the south.\n\nRead More Read More Read More Read More",

                    "body": "The UK is set to see heavier snow on Monday as icy conditions stretch to more parts of northern and eastern England after a yellow warning alert was issued by the Met Office following the arrival of Arctic air.\n\nUp to 5-10cm of snow is likely to accumulate over northern Scotland which has been witnessing chilly conditions since Sunday with temperatures feared to plummet as low as -10C.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Craig Snell said up to 20cm (4 inch) of snow could fall on high ground, with up to 10cm possible in low-lying regions.\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland and could creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued a cold weather alert and placed North-East England, North-West England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nShowers are expected to continue into Monday night and ice is likely to form on untreated surfaces where snow has melted by day.\n\nAreas under the Met Office's yellow weather warning are:\n\nThe Met Office earlier issued a yellow warning starting at 6pm on Sunday for snow in the north-east of Scotland, including Shetland.\n\nAccording to deputy chief meteorologist Chris Almond, \"very cold air\" is set to be spreading across the UK through the week.\n\n\"This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\"\n\nJames Coles, team leader at Moffat Mountain Rescue, advised that upland areas, especially in the mountains, could see conditions change very rapidly, and they may be markedly different from surrounding lowland areas.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at -10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nIt is important to take extra precautions when travelling in these areas, especially if it is necessary to go out in the snow and ice.",

Power outages could also plunge millions into darkness and cold while mobile phone coverage could also go off.",

Advertisement\n\nA Met Office yellow warning is also in force for today and Tuesday and the UK Health Security Agency has also issued a cold weather alert between the early hours of this morning and midnight on Thursday.\n\nA yellow weather warning is issued when there is a small chance of travel delays, minor injuries due to ice, power cuts, and the cutting off of rural areas.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency reminded people to look after the vulnerable. Its cold weather alert will take force from early today and last until midnight on Thursday.\n\nThe north east of England, north west of England and Yorkshire are all under a level three alert, while the rest of the country remain at a level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nThe agency said if a person is over the age of 65 or has a pre-existing medical condition, they should try to heat their home to at least 18C during the cold snap.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: 'During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\nA family enjoys the snow in Tomintoul today. Kate and Fraser Gormley were out in the cold weather with their four-year-old twins\n\nA car in the snow near Tomintoul, a village in Scotland, on Sunday. A Met Office yellow warning for snow comes into force at 6pm\n\nParts of England could also be in for cold and snowy weather this week (Pictured Stoke-on-Trent during the January cold snap this year)\n\nWhat is a Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW)?\n\nA sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is a term used to describe a phenomenon in which the temperature in the stratosphere, a layer of the Earth's atmosphere, increases rapidly.\n\nThe warming can cause the circulation of air at the poles to reduce speed, or even reverse its trajectory.\n\nThis in turn can have a major impact on weather patterns, pushing cold air down from the poles and bringing a storm of freezing weather and blizzards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.'\n\nTemperatures are likely to remain well below the average for March over the next week, the Met Office said.\n\nDeputy Chief Meteorologist, Chris Almond, said: 'Very cold air will spread across the UK from late on Sunday through early next week.\n\n'This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels.\n\n'With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time.'\n\nJames Coles of Scottish Mountain Rescue and Team Leader at Moffat Mountain Rescue added: 'The UK is entering a period of increasingly challenging weather conditions with snow, ice and gusty winds all featuring prominently in the forecast for the coming week.\n\n'Upland areas, especially in the mountains, can see conditions change very rapidly and they may be markedly different from surrounding lowland areas.\n\n'Met Office warnings come into force on Monday, but conditions ahead may deteriorate more quickly at higher elevations.'\n\nThe severe weather, which is the result of an Artic Maritime Airmass sweeping across the UK, comes after a drier February than usual.\n\nThe UK saw just 45 per cent of its average rainfall for the month, with 43.4mm of rain in February, making it the driest in 30 years.\n\nDespite unusually cold conditions for this time of year, it is not the latest that the UK has seen a cold snap.\n\nLast year, Londoners shivered under one of the coldest April nights on record as temperatures fell to -3C, and snow blanketed the capital.",

                    "body": "The Met Office has bought forward its weather warnings for snow after an arctic plume struck the UK earlier than expected, according to The Mirror.\n\nYellow warnings for snow across parts of northeast Scotland will now be in force from Sunday (March 5) evening, with the cold air then moving over the country and down to northern England and increasing chances of snow in southern regions from Wednesday onwards.\n\nIt comes as forecasters predict that the country could potentially see its coldest temperatures of the year so far tomorrow, with conditions remaining chilly throughout the week.\n\nRead More: When will it snow in the south west?\n\nThe Met Office said the mercury could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nWintry conditions may lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels, causing potential disruption on roads and rails.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has meanwhile issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nThe level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said. The alerts all apply between 1 am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nAlthough heavy snowfall isn't anticipated in the southwest early next week, showers on Sunday could turn wintry over the Moors. Further showers are expected on Monday and Tuesday, which may also be wintry on hills, and there's a possibility of snow on lower ground from Wednesday.\n\nThere's still uncertainty about the location and timing of further wintry hazards in our region as milder air attempts to move in from the southwest, but as the week progresses, we'll get a more detailed picture.\n\nOn Thursday, a band of cloud and rain is expected to progress northeastwards from the southwest, potentially bringing some disruptive snowfall to parts of central and southern England and Wales.\n\nInto the weekend, it's anticipated that temperatures will remain colder than average, with occasional wintry showers possible in the north and more persistent rain or snow further south. Later, a transition to milder conditions is expected, with spells of rain and strong winds, although periods of snow remain possible, particularly in the far north.\n\nSpeaking about the arrival of the arctic maritime airmass in northerly regions tonight, Meteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward.\n\n\"We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature-wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold, and the breeze is picking up a little bit, so will be feeling rather chilly.\n\n\"Potentially, we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nRead More:\n\nInvestigation launched after glass bottles allegedly thrown during Bristol City Police appeal for help in finding missing Bristol teen Highway Code rule sets out what to do if someone parks in front of your driveway 'Panther' caught on camera in field by busy A-road New village train station is almost approved but neighbour complains of 'nuisance' Tanno",

                    "body": "The north-west has been hit by a 'level three' alert - meaning there is a very high chance of severely cold weather\n\nA cold weather alert has been issued as parts of the UK are set to be hit by snow this week. Yellow weather warnings issued by the Met Office have been brought forward as Arctic air moves over parts of Scotland and then down to northern England.\n\nNorth-west England is among the areas hit by a level three alert by the UK Health Security Agency, meaning a 90 per cent chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow that could impact the most vulnerable.\n\nIt is predicted that temperatures could plummet to the coldest yet so far this year, particularly on higher ground in northern Scotland, which could experience lows of below minus 10C. The wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nREAD MORE Police searching for missing Peter Baglin confirm human remains discovered\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two. The NHS says the conditions could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients. All areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nParts of Greater Manchester woke up to a light dusting of snow on Sunday morning (March 5) with frost forecasted for much of the region over the coming days.\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18\u00b0C if you can.'\n\nChris Almond, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"Although we've moved into meteorological spring there will be a distinctly wintry feel to our weather next week. Very cold air will spread across the UK bringing snow showers even to sea level in the north on Monday and these snow showers could spread further south on Tuesday.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, it is likely weather warnings will be issued for Monday and Tuesday once the detail of potential impacts becomes clearer, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward. We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly.\n\n\"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that. We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nRead more of today's top stories here.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nNew date set for inquest into death of 'beautiful' woman, 20, at Stockport psychiatric hospital\n\nManchester tip set to close for up to a YEAR for redevelopment\n\nJurors considering verdicts in trial of man accused of murdering girlfriend in city centre apartment\n\nThe Greater Manchester estate where residents feel trapped\n\nSeven bus services in Greater Manchester saved costing \u00a32.5m",

                    "body": "UK Health Security Agency has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three cold weather alert\n\nForecasters have warned this week could see the coldest day of the year so far as swathes of the country face a weather alert over freezing conditions.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency issued the cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nThe level three alert means there is a 90 per chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to the vulnerable and elderly. All areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nOn Sunday yellow weather warnings for snow in Scotland were brought forward as Arctic air moved over the country and down to northern England.\n\nThe Met Office said temperatures could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder. In some parts of Scotland temperatures could fall to as low as -15C over the coming nights while south of the border could also face below freezing conditions.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nThe Met Office has warned those living in the areas covered by the weather warning to prepare for disruption to travel, with \"some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services\".\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nHonor Criswick, a meteorologist for the forecaster, said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward.\n\n\"We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly.\"\n\nShe added that temperatures could drop below the previous low of this year set in January. \"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

                    "body": "Yellow warnings for snow across part of Scotland, possibly leading to the coldest temperature of the year so far on Monday\n\nYellow warnings for snow across parts of Scotland have been brought forward as Arctic air moves over the country and down to northern England, possibly leading to the coldest temperature of the year so far.\n\nThe Met Office said temperatures could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow warning starting at 6pm on Sunday for snow in the north-east of Scotland, including Shetland.\n\nIt advises this could cause disruption to travel, with \"some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services\".\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward.\n\n\"We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly.\n\n\"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

The lowest we have seen was in January at -10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nRead more UK news:\n\nHarry and Meghan invited to King's coronation despite row\n\nYoungest Manchester bombing victim's dad to sue MI5\n\nStormont brake will be veto not delay of EU law\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel and icy surfaces, and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nFor more quality journalism, subscribe to The Northern Echo for \u00a31.50 a week here.\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

                    "body": "Yellow warnings for snow across part of Scotland have been brought forward as Arctic air moves over the country, possibly leading to the coldest temperature of the year so far.\n\nThe Met Office said temperatures could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder. The wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nForecasters have issued a yellow warning starting at 6pm on Sunday for snow in the north-east of Scotland, including Shetland. It advises this could cause disruption to travel, with \"some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services\".\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread further across north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast on Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward. We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly. Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year.\n\n\"The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that. We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions. Police Scotland divisions across the north east and Highlands have issued advice to locals, advising them to be prepared if heading out on the roads.\n\nThe force said: \"Motorists are reminded to plan ahead and allow extra time for your journey. Ensure your vehicle is prepared for the conditions and that you have sufficient fuel, warm clothing, food, water and a charged mobile phone in case of any delays.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - sign up to our daily newsletter here.\n\nRead next:\n\nPolice Scotland facing major cuts over \u00a374million budget black hole\n\nCCTV images of two men released by police after robbery in Glasgow\n\nSNP boss answers claims about pyjama drama in his party which is being questioned by police over alleged fraud",

The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\nSnowy conditions in Hexham in January this year ( Image: PA)\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"\n\nRead More Read More Read More Read More Read More",

                    "body": "The Met Office said temperatures could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow warning starting at 6pm on Sunday for snow in the north-east of Scotland, including Shetland.\n\nIt advises this could cause disruption to travel, with \"some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services\".\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward.\n\n\"We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly.\n\n\"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

                    "body": "Temperatures could plunge as low as minus 10 on Monday night in parts of Scotland.\n\nYellow warnings for snow across part of Scotland have been brought forward as Arctic air moves over the country and down to northern England, possibly leading to the coldest temperature of the year so far.\n\nThe Met Office said temperatures could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder.\n\nThe wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.\n\nA level three alert means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable patients, the NHS said.\n\nAll areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.\n\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow warning starting at 6pm on Sunday for snow in the north-east of Scotland, including Shetland.\n\nIt advises this could cause disruption to travel, with \"some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services\".\n\nFrom midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologist Honor Criswick said: \"We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward.\n\n\"We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.\n\n\"Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it's going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly.\n\n\"Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.\n\n\"We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.\"\n\nAreas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: \"During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.\n\n\"If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.\"",

This brings with it snow even to low levels in the north and east through Monday and Tuesday, and in excess of 10cm could accumulate, most likely on high ground in the north, but also settling for a time at lower levels,\" deputy chief meteorologist, Chris Almond, said.\n\n\"With freezing overnight temperatures and the risk of ice, there's a risk of some travel disruption and wintry hazards are likely to persist through much of next week, even further south for a time, so keep an eye on the Met Office forecast for the latest information.\"\n\nSunday\n\nThe first of the snowfall is set to hit- mainland Scotland on Sunday between 6pm and 11pm in areas above 200m, according to the Met Office.\n\nFurther north, spells of snow will develop to low levels this evening. By late evening 2-5 cm snow may have fallen in some places.\n\nMonday\n\nAs overnight temperatures continue to drop, a band of snow, rain and sleet will move down the UK on Monday.\n\nThe Met Office said there could be snow accumulation of up to two to five cm even at lower levels.\n\nShowers are expected to continue into Monday night and ice is likely to form on untreated surfaces where snow has melted by day.\n\nAreas under the Met Office's yellow weather warning are:\n\nTuesday:\n\nAnother 24-hour yellow weather warning has been issued on Tuesday, as cold, blustery northerly winds will continue to drive frequent showers of snow and hail into the following areas:",
