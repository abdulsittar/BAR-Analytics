                    "body": "Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, plans to announce multiple rounds of layoffs in the coming months, which could equal last year's 13% cut in jobs, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nMeta terminated 13% of its workforce, or nearly 11,000 jobs, in the last year. This year's reductions are likely to reach the same percentage of those who stay.\n\nAccording to the report, the first round of the new layoffs will be disclosed next week, and they will most likely affect positions outside of engineering. As part of these reductions, the company is also said to be disbanding some teams and projects.\n\nAs CEO of Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has previously said that 2023 would be a \"year of efficiency\" and that several initiatives will likely be terminated.\n\nConsidering that in October, Mr. Zuckerberg said the business will have around the same number of workers in 2023 as it had in October, the ongoing layoffs are striking. One month later, the corporation cut 13% of its workforce and used performance reviews to try to cull even more people out of the workforce.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023, several IT businesses, including Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and others, have laid off thousands of workers as revenues fall from pandemic-induced highs. According to Layoffs.fyi, a website keeping track of layoffs, the total number of employees affected by this trend since 2022 is close to 300,000.\n\nAlso, READ: Motorola launches Moto G73 5G in India, to go on sale next week via Flipkart\n\nAccording to the latest available official data, the information sector's overall employment rate has remained stable between the months of July and January. Throughout that time period, the labour force has grown.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.",

This imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial objectives and is independent of the \"flattening\", pointed out internal sources consulted by this medium.\n\nThis new phase of layoffs is expected to end next week, according to people familiar with the matter. Those who work on the plan hope to have it ready before the CEO takes paternity leave for his third child, which may be imminent, these same sources tell this medium.\n\nZuckerberg already warned in January that cuts were coming, although he disguised them as efficiency: \"We are working on flattening our organizational structure and removing some layers from the middle management to make decisions faster, as well as implementing AI tools to help our engineers to be more productive.\n\nThe CEO of Meta is also trying to get the most out of his employees, those who continue to work at the parent company of Instagram, WhatsApp or Facebook. According to Bloomberg, the highest-level managers will share tasks with their subordinates to eliminate duplication and be as efficient as possible.",

                    "body": "The cuts are expected to be extensive, affecting several thousand workers.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is pushing forward with plans to make his company a more \"efficient\" organization.\n\nA second round of layoffs at Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is expected to hit next week, set to leave several thousand more employees without work.\n\nIt's widely thought inside the company that the morning of next Wednesday, March 15, is when employees will be notified of the layoff, according to three people familiar with the company. A company-wide meeting was scheduled earlier this week and was quickly moved to next Thursday, two of the people familiar said.\n\nThe timing would be the same as Meta's last round of layoffs, which were announced on a Wednesday in November. Affected employees lost access to their computers and work tools with a company-wide meeting the next day. This round of layoffs has been in the works for many weeks, as Insider first reported.\n\nAfter a period last year of defiance on company spending, Zuckerberg said in February that 2023 is Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and other executives have only reiterated the mandate.\n\nThe sweep of the first round of layoffs took many employees by surprise, with 11,000 people, or 13%, of Meta's workforce let go. This time around, a common expectation inside the company is for roughly 10%, or about 7,500 people, to be let go.\n\nMeta's headcount will be about back to where it was in 2021, as it was still hiring aggressively, driven by increased usage trends during the pandemic that proved temporary.\n\n\"It's going to be a bloodbath,\" one of the people familiar said of the upcoming layoff.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nMost of the cuts are set to impact those who received lower ranking performance reviews and people in middle management, two of the people familiar said. Performance reviews at Meta just wrapped up this week, and managers and directors were last year issued a mandate to rank more of their reports in lower performing categories, as Insider reported.\n\nZuckerberg last month said he did not want Meta to be a company of \"managers managing managers.\" About two weeks ago, the company started nixing some open management roles, pushing them down to lower ranking levels, while some managers have been told they will be effectively demoted, as Insider reported.\n\nEfforts to further cut costs at Meta, which faced pressure from investors to pull back on expenses like those related to building the metaverse, have been ongoing for months. The company has pulled back on perks and benefits and is in the process of consolidating several offices, including combining the Instagram office in San Francisco with the main Facebook office there.\n\nFor his part, Zuckerberg lately has struck an upbeat tone on the push to make Meta more \"efficient.\" He was \"surprised\" that \"the company felt better\" to him as it started to go through cost cutting.\n\n\"What makes you a better company over time is being able to execute and do more because you're operating more efficiently,\" Zuckerberg said at the time. \"We're in a different environment now where a lot of what we do, it makes sense to focus on the efficiency a lot more than we had previously and make sure we can work effectively. For what it's worth, I think it'll be a more fun place for people to work because they can get more stuff done.\"",

                    "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Meta Platforms Stock?",
                    "body": "After losing more than half its value last year, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock has been on fire in 2023, with shares up roughly 51%. While that's nothing to sneeze at, that's just the tip of the iceberg compared to its long-term performance. In fact, since its debut as Facebook just over a decade ago, Meta Platforms has gained roughly 375% -- even after the stock's recent shellacking.\n\nThis leaves investors in a predicament. Given its significant gains over the past 10 years, would-be investors are left wondering if they've already missed the boat on Meta Platforms. Let's take a step back to see if the stock is still a buy.\n\n\u00a9 Meta Platforms A number of people sitting on a bench and smiling while looking at smartphones. It's the economy\n\nThe economic headwinds that began in late 2021 have no doubt hampered the company's growth, as Meta Platforms gets nearly all its revenue from the digital advertising that appears on its platform. History shows the advertising budget is among the first to be slashed in times of economic uncertainty. Meta Platforms is the world's second-largest digital advertiser, with roughly 20% of the market, according to industry publication Digiday.\n\nThe downturn and the well-documented decline in ad spending have hit Meta Platforms hard, but this dark cloud has a silver lining. Once the economy regains its footing, the digital advertising spigot will reopen, and the ad dollars will flow once again, enriching Meta Platforms in the process.\n\nA detour through the metaverse\n\nWith all deference to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, his recent focus on the metaverse turned heads. Over the preceding two years, Meta Platforms has spent nearly $24 billion to bring this vision to life. Not everyone believes this was a worthwhile investment. That said, the same technologies that focused on this virtual domain have other -- potentially lucrative -- applications.\n\nIt's no secret that Meta Platforms has a long history of developing artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize individuals in photos and recommend content for users of its social media platforms. By the same token, the company has used its algorithms to parse data and direct its advertising efforts.\n\nLet's not forget the development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) that has many more applications than an all-encompassing metaverse -- with use cases in healthcare, education, and entertainment, among others. Meta Platforms will no doubt find other ways to capitalize on the money it spent to bring the metaverse to life.\n\nThe recent buzz surrounding ChatGPT and other chatbots shows that there's still plenty of runway ahead for AI-infused technologies -- an area in which Meta Platforms is well-versed.\n\nA bit of perspective\n\n\"Past performance is no guarantee of future results,\" or so the old saying goes. It does, however, help provide necessary context. The present downturn notwithstanding, Meta Platforms has a history of market-beating growth. For example, as recently as 2021, Meta Platforms grew revenue by 37% and earnings per share by 36%. This illustrates that its current trials are born of the economic climate.\n\nIn the face of these headwinds, the company battened down the hatches, laying off 11,000 people, or 13% of its workforce, while cutting other costs to shore up its financial position. Recent reports suggest another round of layoffs is in the making, with thousands of additional staff cuts on the table.\n\nAnother factor that bears consideration is Meta's unrivaled reach and the corresponding network effect. At latest count, 3.74 billion people log into one of Meta's social media platforms every month, with 2.96 billion checking in daily. Advertisers will go where the eyeballs are, and there's no denying Meta's credentials in that respect.\n\nTaken as a whole, the situation suggests that once the economy finds its footing -- which it no doubt will -- the new, leaner Meta Platforms is poised to come roaring back.\n\nDon't take my word for it. UBS named Meta Platforms as a \"Top Pick,\" citing the company as its \"favorite name\" in the internet space. The firm sees room for higher profits, driven by the aforementioned cost reductions and improving revenue growth. The firm believes the stock will also benefit from both estimate revisions and multiple expansions as the economy improves. Recent data points increase the likelihood that the firm's bull case will play out, pushing Meta Platforms shares as high as $331. This would represent potential gains for investors of 82% compared to Thursday's closing price.\n\nYou get what you pay for\n\nThe downturn has pushed Meta's valuation to historic lows, but it still is not what some investors would call \"cheap,\" particularly in terms of traditional valuation metrics. The stock is currently selling for 4 times next year's expected sales when most experts agree a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is between 1 and 2. That said, given the company's impressive history and multiple competing growth drivers, I would suggest that Meta stock is a value at this price.\n\nI'm not just saying that, either. I bought more shares of Meta Platforms stock just last week.\n\nSPONSORED:\n\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms\n\nWhen our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

                    "body": "This stock has already been a huge winner for investors, but believing its growth is over could be a costly mistake.\n\nAfter losing more than half its value last year, Meta Platforms (META -1.20%) stock has been on fire in 2023, with shares up roughly 51%. While that's nothing to sneeze at, that's just the tip of the iceberg compared to its long-term performance. In fact, since its debut as Facebook just over a decade ago, Meta Platforms has gained roughly 375% -- even after the stock's recent shellacking.\n\nThis leaves investors in a predicament. Given its significant gains over the past 10 years, would-be investors are left wondering if they've already missed the boat on Meta Platforms. Let's take a step back to see if the stock is still a buy.\n\nThe economic headwinds that began in late 2021 have no doubt hampered the company's growth, as Meta Platforms gets nearly all its revenue from the digital advertising that appears on its platform. History shows the advertising budget is among the first to be slashed in times of economic uncertainty. Meta Platforms is the world's second-largest digital advertiser, with roughly 20% of the market, according to industry publication Digiday.\n\nThe downturn and the well-documented decline in ad spending have hit Meta Platforms hard, but this dark cloud has a silver lining. Once the economy regains its footing, the digital advertising spigot will reopen, and the ad dollars will flow once again, enriching Meta Platforms in the process.\n\nWith all deference to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, his recent focus on the metaverse turned heads. Over the preceding two years, Meta Platforms has spent nearly $24 billion to bring this vision to life. Not everyone believes this was a worthwhile investment. That said, the same technologies that focused on this virtual domain have other -- potentially lucrative -- applications.\n\nIt's no secret that Meta Platforms has a long history of developing artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize individuals in photos and recommend content for users of its social media platforms. By the same token, the company has used its algorithms to parse data and direct its advertising efforts.\n\nLet's not forget the development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) that has many more applications than an all-encompassing metaverse -- with use cases in healthcare, education, and entertainment, among others. Meta Platforms will no doubt find other ways to capitalize on the money it spent to bring the metaverse to life.\n\nThe recent buzz surrounding ChatGPT and other chatbots shows that there's still plenty of runway ahead for AI-infused technologies -- an area in which Meta Platforms is well-versed.\n\n\"Past performance is no guarantee of future results,\" or so the old saying goes. It does, however, help provide necessary context. The present downturn notwithstanding, Meta Platforms has a history of market-beating growth. For example, as recently as 2021, Meta Platforms grew revenue by 37% and earnings per share by 36%. This illustrates that its current trials are born of the economic climate.\n\nIn the face of these headwinds, the company battened down the hatches, laying off 11,000 people, or 13% of its workforce, while cutting other costs to shore up its financial position. Recent reports suggest another round of layoffs is in the making, with thousands of additional staff cuts on the table.\n\nAnother factor that bears consideration is Meta's unrivaled reach and the corresponding network effect. At latest count, 3.74 billion people log into one of Meta's social media platforms every month, with 2.96 billion checking in daily. Advertisers will go where the eyeballs are, and there's no denying Meta's credentials in that respect.\n\nTaken as a whole, the situation suggests that once the economy finds its footing -- which it no doubt will -- the new, leaner Meta Platforms is poised to come roaring back.\n\nDon't take my word for it. UBS named Meta Platforms as a \"Top Pick,\" citing the company as its \"favorite name\" in the internet space. The firm sees room for higher profits, driven by the aforementioned cost reductions and improving revenue growth. The firm believes the stock will also benefit from both estimate revisions and multiple expansions as the economy improves. Recent data points increase the likelihood that the firm's bull case will play out, pushing Meta Platforms shares as high as $331. This would represent potential gains for investors of 82% compared to Thursday's closing price.\n\nThe downturn has pushed Meta's valuation to historic lows, but it still is not what some investors would call \"cheap,\" particularly in terms of traditional valuation metrics. The stock is currently selling for 4 times next year's expected sales when most experts agree a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is between 1 and 2. That said, given the company's impressive history and multiple competing growth drivers, I would suggest that Meta stock is a value at this price.\n\nI'm not just saying that, either. I bought more shares of Meta Platforms stock just last week.",

                    "body": "Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed approximately 13 per cent of its workforce, or nearly 11,000 workers, a few months ago.\n\nAccording to recent rumours, Zuckerberg intends to fire a large number of workers. According to one of the most recent Bloomberg stories, Meta is preparing to dismiss thousands more workers as soon as next week.\n\nWhy another round of layoffs?\n\nMeta recently reported disappointing profit and sales declines. According to the story, Meta is preparing a new round of job cuts at both Facebook and Instagram in order to save money. The layoff is anticipated to commence next week and will affect people all over the world. According to the story, the second round of layoffs is motivated by financial goals and is distinct from the \"flattening\" of the company.\n\nAlso read: Meta planning another round of layoffs after firing 11,000 people last year, may fire thousands again\n\nThe impending termination was previously hinted at, particularly after Meta gave \"below par evaluations\" to thousands of workers during its most recent performance review. According to reports, the business is preparing to cut jobs in order to concentrate on the Metaverse and save money.\n\nWhat made people suspicious of Meta?\n\nAccording to some recent accounts, Meta supervisors assigned around 10% of workers the ranking \"meets most,\" which is the company's second-lowest rating. The lowest grade is \"meets some,\" which isn't issued very often by the business. According to a business spokesperson, the rating was provided to encourage high-quality work and long-term thinking.\n\nAlso read: Layoffs at Meta: Meta rates 7000 employees as 'below-average performers' amid layoff rumours\n\nFurthermore, people at Meta became cautious and realised that things weren't right when key managers did not share the resource allocation plans and budgets for the upcoming year. Usually, these plans are shared with the relevant teams and people much earlier in the year, but this year, there was an inexplicable delay. Some teams still haven't received their budgets.\n\nZuckerberg takes responsibility\n\nWhen the first round of layoffs was announced, Zuckerberg accepted complete responsibility for the predicament. \"I want to accept responsibility for these choices and how we arrived here. I realise this is difficult for everyone, and I'm particularly sorry for those who have been affected \"In a message to workers, Meta's CEO stated.\n\nAlso read: Mark Zuckerberg in danger? Meta increases CEO's security allowances to $14 Million amid layoffs\n\nIn the same letter, Zuckerberg disclosed that the business would give severance pay to workers in the United States. He stated that affected workers would receive 16 weeks of base salary and two weeks for each year of employment, with no cap. The business also pledged to pay for any unused PTO time, cover the cost of healthcare, provide three months of job help through an outside partner, and provide visa assistance. Meta also vowed to provide comparable support to other employees or individuals outside the United States, taking into consideration local employment regulations.",

                    "title": "As Meta Democratizes Marketing, Here's What Small Businesses Need to Know to Grow",
                    "body": "Facebook and Instagram resources aim to close the gap for marginalized entrepreneurs.\n\nSocial media is the common marketplace for just about everything these days, supplying forms of cultural and real world currency to billions of users. It's often a democratizing force for creators and businesses operating in highly competitive markets and systems which make it difficult to succeed.\n\nThat's especially the case for businesses started and run by women, which received only 1.9 percent of a US$238.3 billion venture capital market in 2022. And entrepreneurs of color contend with additional barriers to entry, contributing to vast underrepresentation in invested funding.\n\nIt's a difficult environment that funnels many small business owners into a DIY-esque system of cost-effective planning and social media-based marketing, which frequently relies on the benefits of online virality. But behind the scenes, business owners are doing much more on their social platforms than just praying that their next post hits the algorithmic lottery. They are utilizing a vast network of free resources developed by companies pushing for a marketplace where entrepreneurs are eager to monetize their own social posting as an alternative, or supplement, to traditional strategies.\n\nThat especially goes for tech giant Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, which have long integrated business tools on their sites. Now the company hosts a Meta Business Suite for account holders looking to centralize their business operations across platforms, as well as a seamless shopping and checkout experience on both Facebook and Instagram. Meta's even made an effort to support women-led businesses and business owners of color through scholarship and skill-building opportunities, free advertising spots, and leadership avenues -- creating a global online network of small business owners.\n\nNo matter the size or reach of your enterprise, there's probably a Meta resource that could help you out. Knowing just how much information is out there, though, Mashable spoke to entrepreneurs and the business-savvy team at Meta to get the best advice.\n\nDon't forget the basics\n\nMonique Glover is the founder and CEO of natural skincare and beauty brand LaMonique Cosmetics and is pretty much as close to a Meta Business expert as you can get. The 47-year-old started her vitamineral aromatherapy brand in 2017, after becoming concerned about ingredients in many popular beauty products used by Black women in her community, and began advertising on social media in 2020. Since then, Glover has gotten her products into gift bags at the Oscars and in the hands of celebs, and she is on the fast track to exporting her products internationally.\n\n\"Between Facebook and Instagram, you can actually advertise all over the world without paying regular marketing prices,\" explained Glover. \"You're able to reach a very large consumer base and create brand awareness, which is really important because you can have the greatest product, but if nobody knows that you have it, it's pretty much useless. Using social media has really been a turning point in my business and in my life.\"\n\nShe joins other business owners like Annette Njau, a lawyer by trade and the owner of socially-conscious fashion brand House of Takura, who utilize the cross-platform tools to manage advertising and customer service for their brands. The 45-year-old started the full brand, named after her now college-aged son, in 2017 after designing a fashion line inspired by her home country of Sierra Leone.\n\n\"The reality of the matter is I'm not a business person. I don't know how to run a business. I just knew I liked a certain kind of look and I wanted everybody else out there to have the opportunity to have that look,\" she said. But, just like millions of others, Njau did know that when her fashion line started gathering attention she needed to do one thing: Start an Instagram page.\n\nSet a foundation for your business' online presence\n\nBefore you can effectively use your social platforms, you have to handle some basics. According to both Glover and the Meta team that spoke to Mashable, the first thing every business owner needs to do is claim their business handles immediately. Creating a Facebook Business Page and claiming your business name on Instagram can go a long way in avoiding a conflict down the line.\n\nNext, create a personalized business plan that breaks down just how much you want to spend on marketing, specifically allotting for social media spending, which can come in forms like paid advertising or boosting posts. Meta has a helpful breakdown of everything you need to consider, as well as a guided tool to building your own marketing plan.\n\nNjau says that an easy mistake business pages make is not enabling checkout on all platforms. Find out how to do that using Meta's Commerce Manager.\n\nGlover also notes that enabling Meta Pay, Meta's in-house payment platform, has really helped her sales. \"It's kind of like their own version of PayPal. When people order from a website, they want to use something that they feel comfortable with and that's secure. If you're on Instagram, and you're shopping, you already trust the platform.\"\n\nIn the long term, you might need to factor in paying someone to manage your social media on your behalf, says Njau, who recently brought on a professional social media manager to help her take advantage of all of Meta's marketing opportunities. \"Number one: It's got to be at a time where you can pay the person a living wage.\"\n\nAnd try to be an early adopter to all of Meta's new launches, Njau says. \"It almost feels like every time you early-adopt something, Meta keeps that in mind. When something new rolls out, you're seeing it first on your personal profile, before everybody else is seeing it.\"\n\nTake advantage of Meta's free resources\n\nMeta's essentially launching a new tool, course, or quick tips guide every week, but Meta told Mashable that business owners should pay attention to three main Meta resources:\n\nMeta for Business\n\nMeta for Business, or the Meta Business Suite, is the main page for all business and advertising needs across platforms, offering how-to guides, certifications, and marketing insights about online advertising.\n\n\"It's a great place to start,\" the Meta team explained. \"It helps small businesses build a personalized marketing plan for step-by-step guidance on meeting specific needs and goals, [as well as find] inspiration from other businesses while providing industry insights and tools to track your progress, all in one place.\"\n\nCheck out Meta's guide to building brand awareness or its introduction to advertising, with specifics for all platforms.\n\nMeta Blueprint\n\nMeta Blueprint offers free, self-guided courses to help business owners build their marketing skills across Meta's family of apps, like how to create digital gift cards for your business or host profitable online events.\n\nThe site also connects business owners to Meta's certification opportunities intended to establish and prove expertise in areas like Marketing Science, Media Buying, and Community Management.\n\nWomen and minority-led businesses are often hit hardest by macro-economic challenges like the pandemic and inflation, and saw higher closure rates during the pandemic...\n\nMeta\n\nMeta Performance Hub\n\nThe Performance Hub is a Meta Business site which \"offers a framework with five data-proven actions that small and medium-sized businesses can take to improve ad performance and maximize marketing budgets,\" Meta explained.\n\nHere, entrepreneurs can find analytics-based advice and a system for using Meta's Conversions API and Pixel, which connect your business' marketing data (from partner sites outside of Meta) to Meta's platforms to track reach and impact.\n\nOther free tools\n\nGlover credits a lot of her initial success to a free Meta advertising credit, given to her by the company during the pandemic's stay-at-home orders. \"I received this email from Meta with a US$10 ad credit, and I was like, 'What am I going to do with this?' And then I finally figured it out. I did some research and I created this ad, and I said, 'Wow, with just this US$10, I've made about US$300,'\" she said. Be on the lookout for free credit promotions like these, which can help expand your reach and boost your ads.\n\nShe also encourages business owners to check out other free classes offered on Coursera, an online education platform which oversees the free Meta Social Media Marketing Professional Certificate.\n\nIn addition, Njau suggests business owners consider applying to Meta's Leaders Network, like she did. The network connects fellow small business owners with resources (like ad credits and networking), and marketing and press opportunities, as well as exclusive access to upcoming products and new policies.\n\nVideo rules across apps\n\nSomething that both Njau and Glover have had to adjust to is the success of video content over other forms of natural posting. Njau saw a marked difference when she started posting Reels that gave a behind-the-scenes look into her business process, including the production of her goods by her teams of makers in places like Kenya. \"It gives people an insight, the behind-the-scenes look into your business. I think maybe IGTV and regular videos didn't do that as well before,\" she said, noting how Reels allows users much more editing and sharing flexibility than previous video options.\n\nNjau is right, according to Meta. \"In the last six months, reshares of Reels have more than doubled, making Reels a huge opportunity for small businesses to reach new customers,\" the company said.\n\nMaster the Meta Creator Studio\n\nThat said, as trends and tools shift constantly, \"it can be hard for small businesses to find time to master new creative formats,\" Meta acknowledged, \"and video can be especially intimidating to get started.\"\n\nTo support the streamlining of that effort, Meta's Creator Studio lets users publish, schedule, and manage all content across Facebook and Instagram in a single place. This includes cross-posting, calendar management, bulk-uploads to accounts, and the ability to create content series on their pages. The studio's app lets you manage multiple Facebook pages at once, as well.\n\nThe company has also published more direct guides to starting a video-based page. \"We have developed a number of resources to help small businesses take those first steps, like step-by-step guides or plug-and-play templates in the app, to make it easy to test out your own creativity with trending formats and audio. We encourage that when starting out with Reels, businesses brush up on best practices for mobile-first video, capturing short (under 15 seconds) videos, on a mobile device in vertical format for mobile viewing to get the best results.\"\n\nWant to learn more about getting the best out of your tech?

This has impacted how she builds brand loyalty online.\n\nMeta says that's easily translatable into posting as a business. \"Be intentional and think about what you are offering to your customers, what solution you're providing, and focus your posts around that.\"\n\nPersonalized messaging matters\n\nThat goes for direct interactions with customers, as well. \"Three-quarters of adults globally say they want to communicate with businesses via messaging in the same way they communicate with friends and family,\" Meta explained. \"As a result, we've seen a major shift in the need for customers to connect directly to businesses online as they would in person.\" Meta Business platforms integrate messaging tools like Messenger, Instagram Direct, and even WhatsApp on behalf of business owners.\n\nFocus on your reach rather than your follower count\n\nGlover says that the biggest success story in using Meta advertising tools isn't something that can be seen on the customer-facing side of her social pages. \"It's not always about the likes and followers, it's about your reach,\" she said. By using their dynamic ad offerings, she said, \"my reach went from 200 [people] to 510,000. And when you can reach a massive amount of people, you can broaden your consumer base and convert that reach into sales, building your business on a dime.\"\n\n\"When I say be authentic, I mean remember that you're a human being at the end of the day,\" Njau said. \"People like that. People want to know that you have the same struggles as them. I'm so grateful for the community that keeps me going every day. As a business owner, I'm unapologetically me. I don't have time to be anybody else.\"\n\nFor marginalized entrepreneurs: Claim your space\n\nBoth Glover and Njau started their businesses with a personal story and mission tied to their identities as Black women, an aspect which is integral to their brands and success.\n\nFor Glover, using sites like Instagram to build her business is about doing good for her community. \"As an African American woman creating these products, I know that in a lot of urban neighborhoods beauty supply stores carry toxic cosmetics, so I wanted to alleviate that. I'm also a survivor of domestic violence,\" she explained. \"I wanted to do something where I could empower women through beauty.\" Combining both her birth name and the new name she had to assume to protect her and her children, Glover started LaMonique.\n\nFor Njau, her business is about paving a future for global communities and the African diaspora, as well as encouraging the social impact partnerships that empower her makers. \"I have a heart for the continent. I'm hoping my kids and their grandkids will see it in their lifetime, where people are not surprised that high-end items come from Africa, where the youth unemployment rate is not 65 percent on the continent, where people are valued.\"\n\nUse free services to break down systemic barriers\n\nFor strategic entrepreneurs, goals like these could be achievable -- especially if companies and money-holders step up to promote equity and support the missions of socially-conscious, diversity-first businesses.\n\n\"Women and minority-led businesses are often hit hardest by macro-economic challenges like the pandemic and inflation, and saw higher closure rates during the pandemic, according to our research,\" Meta told Mashable. To address this, the company created programs like Meta Elevate, which offers resources to help Black and Latinx users build digital skills for business ownership and distributes scholarships to fund professional certifications. Glover was a recipient of such a grant, which she used to obtain a Digital Marketing Associate Certification.\n\nThere's also Meta Prosper, which facilitates learning and economic opportunities for Asian and Pacific Islander-owned businesses, and the SheMeansBusiness program, a Meta series that has trained more than a million women in 38 countries on digital tools. For Women's History Month, Meta also just launched the Women's Community Impact Guide to help \"build business, community, and momentum\" toward women's equality.\n\n\"I believe in the power of persistence,\" Njau said. \"Be consistent, be authentic, be responsible.\"\n\nHey!

                    "body": "On May 14, 1984, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born in White Plains, New York. Edward, his father, is a dentist, and Karen, his mother, is a psychiatrist. Randi, Donna, and Arielle are his sisters. Zuckerberg first used computers and learned to program when he was in middle school.\n\nIn the 1990s, his dad taught him how to code in BASIC, and then in the 2000s, he hired software engineer David Newman to give him one-on-one lessons. After completing his school and dropping out from Harvard, Mark started Facebook, which shot to fame in no time. Due to Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has earned a massive net worth.\n\nAmerican tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Mark Zuckerberg is worth an estimated $37 billion. Mark Zuckerberg has been one of the richest people on the planet for most of the last ten years. Mark is the youngest of the top 100 richest persons in the world.\n\nMuch of Mark's wealth comes from his stake in Facebook, which is not surprising. Mark presently has over 400 million shares of Facebook, which are divided among several classes with varying voting rights. Over 81% of all Class B shares, or 365 million, are in his possession.\n\nHe also controls around 12 million Class A shares. Mark controls 53% of the company's vote thanks to his Class B super voting shares. Mark effectively controls roughly 58% of the company's overall voting power because he also owns co-founder Dustin Moskovitz's Class B voting rights.\n\nIf you want to read about the wealth of other notable people, then click below:\n\nMark Zuckerberg receives an annual salary of one dollar. Certainly it is not a typo here. In order to maximize the company's revenues, many CEOs, like Zuckerberg, chose to pay themselves minimal salaries. When a company tries to make as much money as possible, the overall value of their stock holdings goes up. This is where the real wealth of the executive comes from. CEOs like Eric Schmidt, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin all make a measly $1 a year.\n\nIt's possible that many more Meta employees may soon be packing up and heading home. According to Bloomberg's early Tuesday story, the company Meta expects to lay off \"thousands\" of people, with the first round of job layoffs perhaps being finalized as soon as this week.\n\nFor weeks now, rumors have circulated that Mark Zuckerberg's company will be laying off even more employees. Nevertheless, it has only been four months since Mark Zuckerberg's company, Meta, laid off 11,000 employees, or 13% of its global employment.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has declared 2023 to be Facebook's \"year of efficiency,\" despite the fact that the firm has seen setbacks in the \"metaverse\"-focused Reality Labs section and a drop in its advertising empire. You can see the official tweet by Bloomberg below in which Meta is planning a fresh round of layoffs.\n\nAccording to unnamed sources cited by Bloomberg, the company's renewed emphasis on its metaverse goals is driving this latest round of layoffs. This seems to be an attempt to help the company reach its financial goals for 2023. Reports say that the company asked all of its team directors and vice presidents to come up with a list of people who should be let go.\n\nZuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan are expecting their third child, and he plans to take some time off to care for them. Reports say that the plan is to have the layoffs ready to go before Mark goes on leave.\n\nThe Menlo Park headquarters and possibly other locations of the corporation are rumored to be undergoing a \"flattening,\" in addition to the alleged layoffs. According to previous reports, Meta is exerting pressure on the middle managers of small teams to encourage them to complete more menial tasks or leave the company altogether.\n\nWith that, it is evident that we have covered the topic of Mark Zuckerberg Net Worth. The tech entrepreneur has made an enormous amount of wealth throughout his professional life. If you want to know more about content, please visit our website, talkxbox.com.",

Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft have also cut thousands of jobs.",

                    "body": "Meta and many other companies joined the International Women's Day celebration yesterday. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp posted advice for the \"extraordinary women\" of the LinkedIn community.\n\nistock\n\nIt's ironic because the only advice the tech giant should be imparting is how to help the women who work there earn the same as the men.\n\nReuters\n\nThe current gender pay gap report for Meta's U.K. and Ireland divisions shows that female employees are paid less than their male counterparts. This holds for both hourly and salaried positions.\n\nReuters\n\nWomen also get incentives that are 34.8% lower on average than those given to males at Meta, and they make up fewer than 35% of the highest-paid positions.\n\nIn 2021-2022, women earned, on average, 2.1% less than men, and the data suggests that this difference is getting bigger, which shows that gender equality in the workplace is getting worse.\n\nAccording to Meta's first report on gender equality (2018), women earned 0.9% less than males.\n\nThe study, done privately and released in December as part of new laws that went into effect in Ireland last year, found that in 2022, women working in all fields in Ireland were paid, on average, 15.7% less than men.\n\n\"We have more men than women working at Meta in technical roles, particularly senior technical roles,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThey further claimed that the pay for those with these \"skills\" is higher than for \"non-technical roles\" and that \"the pool of this talent, particularly for more senior positions, continues to be predominantly male.\"\n\n\"This is a challenge faced by all technology companies and many companies in other industries. We recognize that this is a journey, one we are fully committed to, and we believe the actions we are taking now are having and will continue to have an impact on improving the diversity of our workforce,\" Meta added.\n\nMeta said in the report that it wants 50% of its worldwide employees to be women and underrepresented minorities. Yet, its diversity reporting has stagnated.\n\nSince Meta started providing its diversity report in 2018, women have made up 37% of the workforce, an increase of 1%.\n\nThe social network business stated it is tackling this representation problem via recruiting, including its \"diverse slate approach, and analyzing and assessing its \"attract\" strategy.\n\n\"Last year, we established an external partnership model comprising three flagship partnerships: ColorinTech, Everywoman, and BYP (Black Young Professionals),\" Meta commented.\n\nUnsplash\n\n\"All these partnerships result in a steady increase in the hiring rates of underrepresented candidates, and we have seen increases in female representation at Meta, including in technical and leadership roles.\"",

The senators also emphasized data collection on face and eye movement, physiological damage and exposure to abusive behavior.\n\nThe Meta Timeline: Meta has already spent billions building out the metaverse. In 2022 alone, the company spent $15.9 billion on its Reality Labs division.\n\nOn Monday, Meta reportedly slashed the price of Quest Pro to fend off competition from Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) upcoming MR headset launch.\n\nThe same day, it was reported that Meta iss planning to terminate thousands more employees based on financial targets. In November, the Facebook and Instagram parent let go of 11,000 employees, or 13% of its workforce.\n\nArete analyst Richard Kramer downgraded Meta Platforms to Sell from Neutral on Monday.\n\nMeta saw some redemption Tuesday, when the company higlighted its milestone of reaching 2 billion daily active users and issued an update on its progress in AI endeavors.\n\nThe Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLC), Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF (NYSE: FCOM), and IShares Global Comm Services ETF (NYSE: IXP) have an exposure of 12%-21% in the stock.

                    "body": "Mr Kelley, originally from Boston, has been working with Meta -- formerly Facebook -- for the last 14 years and was only appointed to the position of managing director in April last year.\n\nHe moved from Yahoo in 2009 to take up the position of Facebook director of sales across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nHe also serves as Meta's global vice president of gaming and app monetisation solutions.\n\nIn a post on his Facebook page, Mr Kelley said that he would be wrapping up in the coming months, adding that it was \"not an easy decision to make\".\n\nHe said that he intends to take a break from work and \"recharge my batteries\".\n\n\"I am incredibly grateful for taking the chance of moving to Ireland for this gig ... My time at Meta, here in Dublin, has been the greatest of my career,\" he stated.\n\nThis comes as Bloomberg reported that Meta -- which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- is planning a fresh round of layoffs, with the potential for thousands more jobs to be lost.\n\nIn November, the company announced that it would be cutting its global workforce by 11,000, resulting in 350 job losses in Ireland. Before the layoffs, it employed 3,000 people here.\n\nVR platform\n\nThis round of cuts is being driven by financial targets, with the company seeing a slowdown in advertising revenue as it shifts to its virtual-reality platform.\n\nThis phase of layoffs is expected to be finalised soon.\n\nAccording to estimates from the Central Bank, more than 2,300 jobs have already been lost in tech companies in recent months, with companies including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Twitter, Dell, and Hewlett Packard all seeking to reduce their global workforces.\n\nHowever, it said that global layoffs by multinationals have had a limited effect on the tech employment pool here in Ireland.\n\nInformation and communications technology (ICT) companies provide 164,000 jobs in Ireland, according to the Central Bank.\n\nIt also said these companies play an outsized role in Ireland in terms of the jobs they provide, the wages they pay, and the billions in corporation tax revenues delivered to the exchequer.",

                    "body": "What is more damning than drawing a lower package? A lower package than what your male counterpart gets for the same designation and profile. There's nothing more condemnable than when the likes of Meta indulges in pay parity. According to a new damning report, the Mark Zuckerberg company continues to pay lower salaries and even lower bonuses to women employees in the UK and Ireland.\n\nPer the gender pay report for Meta Ireland released in December 2022, there are 3000 women staff in Ireland and 5000 at the UK office. They make up for about 10 percent of Meta's global workforce. In 2022, Meta Ireland's women employees were compensated 15.7% less than their male counterparts. There's a huge difference in bonus pay as well. Meta Ireland's women staff were paid 43% less bonuses than men. Meanwhile in Meta UK, women employees were paid 2.1% lower than men. Bonuses were 34.8% lower than men. The average annual salary of a Meta employee starts at around $150,000. However, according to the report, men make $23,000 more than the women employees in Ireland. For the UK, the estimate is no less than $3,000 for men.\n\nThe situation is unlikely to change as Meta continues to layoff and slash its workforce. Earlier Mark Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 as the 'Year of Efficiency' for Meta. Managers have been asked to contribute by coding and not idling around.\n\nThe chatter around the gender pay gap seems more tokenism in BigTech. Should regulators step in and make legislation?\n\nSee Also: 9 Female Celebrities On The Gender Pay Gap And How To Fix It\n\nSee Also: On Women's Day, Urfi Javed Says 'F*ck You Taliban' After Women Are Forced To Return To Abusive Ex Husbands",

                    "body": "The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp posted advice for the \"extraordinary women\" in its community on LinkedIn.\n\nBut perhaps, the only advice the tech giant should be posting is how the females in its firm can earn as much as their male counterparts.\n\nBecause the woman working at Meta, in the U.K. or Ireland, are still being paid significantly less than men at the tech giant.\n\nAccording to Meta's most recent gender pay gap report for its U.K. and Ireland arm, its female workers are paid less than their male colleagues -- whether they're hourly workers or on a salary.\n\nThe company also hands women smaller bonuses and men make up the majority of high-paid workers in the U.K. and Ireland business that has headquarters in London and Dublin.\n\nFor every \u00a31 a male employee earns at Meta U.K., women earn 92p when looking at median hourly pay.\n\nThe average bonus going to women at Meta is also 34.8% less than bonuses paid to men, and women hold less than a third of the highest-paid roles.\n\nWomen were paid 2.1% less than the average man in 2021-2022, and the trend seems to be going in the wrong direction, as the data points to a decline in gender equality at the firm.\n\nIn 2018, when Meta published its first report on gender equality, women were paid on average 0.9% less than men.\n\nThe gap report from Meta's Ireland business makes for an even more grim reading.\n\nThe report, which was quietly released in December as part of a new law in the country that went into effect last year, revealed that women working across Meta in Ireland were paid 15.7% less on average than men in 2022.\n\nThe difference in bonus pay in the country is even starker, with the average bonus for women being 43.3% lower than those that men were awarded.\n\nMeta blamed \"unequal representation\" for their pay gap.\n\n\"We have more men than women working at Meta in technical roles, particularly senior technical roles,\" the company said in a statement:\n\nIt further explained that the pay for those with these \"skills\" are higher than for \"non-technical roles\" and that \"the pool of this talent, particularly for more senior positions, continues to be predominantly male.\"\n\n\"This is a challenge faced by all companies in Tech and by many companies in other industries. We recognize that this is a journey, one we are fully committed to and believe the actions we are taking now are, and will continue to have impact on improving the diversity of our workforce,\" Meta added.\n\nWhile most of the company's employees are in the U.S., which does not require pay gap disclosures from companies, Meta has about 3,000 workers in Ireland and about 5,000 in the U.K., making up roughly 10% of its current global workforce.\n\nIn the report, Meta also shared its ambitions for half of its global workforce to be made up of women and underrepresented minorities. But the company's diversity reporting shows signs of stagnation.\n\nAs of last year, women make up 37% of the workforce, up just 1% since 2018 when Meta began sharing its diversity report.\n\nThe social media company said that it's addressing this representation issue through hiring, including its Diverse Slate Approach, and by reviewing and assessing its Attract strategy.\n\n\"Last year we established an External Partnership model comprising three flagship partnerships: ColourinTech, Everywoman and BYP (Black Young Professionals),\" Meta commented.\n\n\"All these partnerships result in a steady increase in the hiring rates of underrepresented candidates, and we have seen increases to female representation at Meta, including in technical roles and in leadership roles.\"",

                    "body": "By Sneha Saha: Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg fired around 13 per cent of the workforce, which is around 13000 employees, a few months ago. As per the latest reports, Zuckerberg is planning to fire many more employees. One of the latest reports from Bloomberg suggests that Meta is planning to fire thousands of more employees as early as next week. While Meta didn't confirm the second round of layoffs, Bloomberg's past report about the first layoff turned out to be true.\n\nMeta recently announced disappointing earnings and a drop in revenue. To save costs, the report suggests, Meta is planning a fresh round of job cuts at both Facebook and Instagram. The layoff is expected to begin next week and likely to hit all parts of the world. The report also states that the second round of layoffs is driven by financial targets and is different from the \"flattening\" of organization.\n\nThe upcoming layoff was hinted at previously, specifically after Meta gave \"subpar ratings\" to thousands of employees during its latest performance review. It is said that the company now wants to focus on metaverse and save money, hence, planning to cut jobs.\n\nSome of the recent reports suggested that managers at Meta gave around 10 per cent of employees a rating of \"meets most\", which is the second-lowest rating at the company. The lowest rating is \"meets some\", which isn't given by the company very often. The company spokesperson highlighted that the rating has been given to incentivize high-quality work and long-term thinking.\n\nAs per a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, some of the senior officials at Meta expect that the low ratings will lead to more employees leaving the company in the coming weeks.\n\nAt the time of announcing the first round of layoffs, Zuckerberg took full responsibility for the situation. \"I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I'm especially sorry to those impacted,\" the Meta CEO wrote in a letter to employees.\n\nIn the same letter, Zuckerberg revealed severance pay that the company would be paying for employees in the United States. He said that impacted employees would get 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, with no cap. The company also promised to pay all remaining PTO time, cover the cost of healthcare, provide three months of career support with an external vendor, and immigration support. Additionally, for other employees or people outside the US, Meta promised to offer similar support, taking into account local employment laws.",

                    "body": "The tech giant could slash \"thousands of employees as soon as this week,\" according to a new report via Bloomberg. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nLast November, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of the company's workforce. For the past year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has pressed Meta's staff to operate with a greater sense of urgency or leave the company. \"Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people... who shouldn't be here,\" he reportedly told employees in summer 2022. At the beginning of 2023, he announced the company could look forward to a \"year of efficiency.\"\n\nWhile Meta's initial layoffs targeted staff throughout the company, Zuckerberg has suggested his future moves will focus more on the management structure. \"I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work,\" Zuckerberg said during an all-hands meeting in February, according to the Command Line newsletter.\n\nOf course, Meta isn't alone in unleashing sweeping layoffs. Amazon and Google have both laid off more corporate workers than Meta over the past two quarters (18,000 and 12,000, respectively), while Microsoft, Salesforce, Uber, Dell, IBM, Twitter, Cisco, and others have all announced plans to reduce headcount. Like Meta, many of these companies used elevated revenues from the pandemic to engage in broad hiring sprees; but growing fears of an oncoming recession are now leading executives to engage in cost-cutting -- and layoffs.",

During that time, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone hinted on Twitter that Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, suggested that a lot more employee firings were underway.\n\nIn November, Meta cut over 11,000 jobs in one of the biggest layoffs last year. Mass layoffs in tech companies have been common instances these days, with Google and Microsoft also cutting down thousands of jobs in the past few months.",

                    "body": "By Divyanshi Sharma: The world celebrated International Women's Day yesterday and social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter were full of stories of women entrepreneurs and employees. However, even in 2023, the issue of gender pay gap exists, and the problem is more serious than some people realise. Meta, earlier known as Facebook, reportedly pays lesser salaries to its female employees when compared to male employees, in Ireland and UK.\n\nA Business Insider report says that Meta pays its female employees lesser salaries and bonuses when compared to its male employees. Be it hourly workers or full-time workers, female workers get lesser pay than men if they are working for Meta in the UK or Ireland. The report also states that 3,000 women are working in Meta offices in Ireland and 5,000 are in the UK. This makes up for around 10 per cent of its global workforce.\n\nMeta Ireland's Gender Pay Report was released in December 2022, in accordance with the country's law. Last year, women were reportedly paid 15.7 per cent less than their male counterparts in the company. This gap is even more when once talks about average bonuses as women in the country get 43.3 per cent lower bonuses when compared to men.\n\nComing to UK, the pay disparity is relatively lesser when compared to Ireland, but it still exists. The Business Insider report states that according to a report from 2022 detailing pay data from 2021, women are paid 2.1 per cent lesser than their male counterparts in the UK. The bonuses difference is quite high as women get 34.8 per cent less bonuses when compared to men.\n\nMeta announced its decision to lay off 11,000 people last year and a fresh wave of layoffs is expected at the company soon. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced 2023 to be the 'year of efficiency' and had also said in an internal meeting that he will be removing some middle managers in order to speed up the decision-making process.\n\n\"I just think we've entered somewhat of a phase change for the company,\" he said as per a report in The Verge. The CEO further added that the number of employees at the company has been growing steadily for nearly two decades which makes it \"very hard to really crank on efficiency while you're growing that quickly.\" He then said that he is focused on increasing efficiency of how decisions are made by \"flattening the organisation structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster.\"",

                    "title": "Meta has a pay gap problem, with women abroad getting lower pay and smaller bonuses than men",
                    "body": "Globally, the number of women working for Meta has increased just 1% since 2018.\n\nIf you're a woman working for Meta abroad, chances are you're getting paid substantially less than the typical man who works there.\n\nThe company, formerly known as Facebook, continues to pay women less than men, whether they're hourly workers or on salary, according to Meta's most recently available reports on pay inequity in the U.K. and Ireland. The company also hands women smaller bonuses, the reports said.\n\nWhile most of the company's employees are in the U.S., which does not require pay gap disclosures from companies, Meta has about 3,000 workers in Ireland and about 5,000 in the U.K., making up roughly 10% of its current global workforce, although a new round of layoffs is expected soon.\n\nThe report on Meta's pay gap in Ireland is the most recent, having been released quietly in December as part of a new law in the country that went into effect last year. In 2022, women working across Meta in Ireland were paid 15.7% less on average than men at the company. The difference in bonus pay in the country is even larger, with the average bonus for women being 43.3% lower than those that go to men.\n\nFor women working at Meta in the U.K., where the company operates out of London, the pay gap is smaller but still prevalent, according to a report from last year detailing pay data from 2021. The average woman there was paid 2.1% less than the average man. And again, the difference in bonuses is much more stark, with the average bonus going to women being 34.8% less than bonuses paid to men.\n\nThe pay gap at Meta in the U.K. is actually worse than it was when it first started reporting figures in 2018. At that time, women were paid on average 0.9% less than men, although their bonus pay was 40% less.\n\nBase pay at Meta often starts around $150,000 a year, so a woman earning that much in Ireland can expect that a man is making about $23,000 more than her. A woman in the U.K. can expect a man is making about $3,000 more.\n\nThe company for several years has said it's working toward a \"vision\" that half of its global workforce be women and people from \"underrepresented groups.\" Two years ago, it planned to reach that goal by 2023. Now the goal appears to have been pushed back to 2024, with the company's diversity report from last year falling short of that goal. As of last year, women make up 37% of the workforce, up just 1% since 2018 when Meta began sharing its diversity report.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company \"regularly conducts pay equity analysis, and our latest analysis confirms that we continue to have pay equity across genders globally and by race in the US for people in similar jobs (accounting for factors such as location, role and level).\"\n\nIn the reports showing an ongoing pay gap, Meta said its problem of pay inequity comes down to fewer women in technological roles. In Ireland, while the company said its workforce is almost half men and women, men hold more high-level and tech-focused jobs, according to the report.\n\n\"As tech jobs like production engineers are typically paid more in the market, it has a disproportionate impact on pay gaps,\" Meta said in the report. Similarly, equity awards and bonuses for these types of roles are also larger.\n\nIn the U.K., Meta admitted to having an ongoing problem of \"unequal representation\" in its ranks, with more men working at the company overall and in technical roles, \"particularly senior technical roles.\" The company added that most of its U.K. workforce is dedicated to engineering.\n\n\"The pool of this talent, particularly for more senior positions, continues to be predominantly male,\" Meta said in its report.",

                    "body": "\u00a9 Glassdoor Glassdoor Meta once aimed to get its global workforce to half women and underrepresented groups by this year. The company still pays women abroad less than men and gives them much smaller bonuses. Globally, the number of women working for Meta has increased just 1% since 2018.\n\nIf you're a woman working for Meta abroad, chances are you're getting paid substantially less than the typical man who works there.\n\nThe company, formerly known as Facebook, continues to pay women less than men, whether they're hourly workers or on salary, according to Meta's most recently available reports on pay inequity in the U.K. and Ireland. The company also hands women smaller bonuses, the reports said.\n\nWhile most of the company's employees are in the U.S., which does not require pay gap disclosures from companies, Meta has about 3,000 workers in Ireland and about 5,000 in the U.K., making up roughly 10% of its current global workforce, although a new round of layoffs is expected soon.\n\nThe report on Meta's pay gap in Ireland is the most recent, having been released quietly in December as part of a new law in the country that went into effect last year. In 2022, women working across Meta in Ireland were paid 15.7% less on average than men at the company. The difference in bonus pay in the country is even larger, with the average bonus for women being 43.3% lower than those that go to men.\n\nFor women working at Meta in the U.K., where the company operates out of London, the pay gap is smaller but still prevalent, according to a report from last year detailing pay data from 2021. The average woman there was paid 2.1% less than the average man. And again, the difference in bonuses is much more stark, with the average bonus going to women being 34.8% less than bonuses paid to men.\n\nThe pay gap at Meta in the U.K. is actually worse than it was when it first started reporting figures in 2018. At that time, women were paid on average 0.9% less than men, although their bonus pay was 40% less.\n\nBase pay at Meta often starts around $150,000 a year, so a woman earning that much in Ireland can expect that a man is making about $23,000 more than her. A woman in the U.K. can expect a man is making about $3,000 more.\n\nThe company for several years has said it's working toward a \"vision\" that half of its global workforce be women and people from \"underrepresented groups.\" Two years ago, it planned to reach that goal by 2023. Now the goal appears to have been pushed back to 2024, with the company's diversity report from last year falling short of that goal. As of last year, women make up 37% of the workforce, up just 1% since 2018 when Meta began sharing its diversity report.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company \"regularly conducts pay equity analysis, and our latest analysis confirms that we continue to have pay equity across genders globally and by race in the US for people in similar jobs (accounting for factors such as location, role and level).\"\n\nIn the reports showing an ongoing pay gap, Meta said its problem of pay inequity comes down to fewer women in technological roles. In Ireland, while the company said its workforce is almost half men and women, men hold more high-level and tech-focused jobs, according to the report.\n\n\"As tech jobs like production engineers are typically paid more in the market, it has a disproportionate impact on pay gaps,\" Meta said in the report. Similarly, equity awards and bonuses for these types of roles are also larger.\n\nIn the U.K., Meta admitted to having an ongoing problem of \"unequal representation\" in its ranks, with more men working at the company overall and in technical roles, \"particularly senior technical roles.\" The company added that most of its U.K. workforce is dedicated to engineering.\n\n\"The pool of this talent, particularly for more senior positions, continues to be predominantly male,\" Meta said in its report.\n\nAre you a Meta employee or someone else with insight to share?

                    "body": "By clicking 'Sign up', you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you're a woman working for Meta abroad, chances are you're getting paid substantially less than the typical man who works there.\n\nThe company, formerly known as Facebook, continues to pay women less than men, whether they're hourly workers or on salary, according to Meta's most recently available reports on pay inequity in the U.K. and Ireland. The company also hands women smaller bonuses, the reports said.\n\nWhile most of the company's employees are in the U.S., which does not require pay gap disclosures from companies, Meta has about 3,000 workers in Ireland and about 5,000 in the U.K., making up roughly 10% of its current global workforce, although a new round of layoffs is expected soon.\n\nThe report on Meta's pay gap in Ireland is the most recent, having been released quietly in December as part of a new law in the country that went into effect last year. In 2022, women working across Meta in Ireland were paid 15.7% less on average than men at the company. The difference in bonus pay in the country is even larger, with the average bonus for women being 43.3% lower than those that go to men.\n\nFor women working at Meta in the U.K., where the company operates out of London, the pay gap is smaller but still prevalent, according to a report from last year detailing pay data from 2021. The average woman there was paid 2.1% less than the average man. And again, the difference in bonuses is much more stark, with the average bonus going to women being 34.8% less than bonuses paid to men.\n\nThe pay gap at Meta in the U.K. is actually worse than it was when it first started reporting figures in 2018. At that time, women were paid on average 0.9% less than men, although their bonus pay was 40% less.\n\nBase pay at Meta often starts around $150,000 a year, so a woman earning that much in Ireland can expect that a man is making about $23,000 more than her. A woman in the U.K. can expect a man is making about $3,000 more.\n\nThe company for several years has said it's working toward a \"vision\" that half of its global workforce be women and people from \"underrepresented groups.\" Two years ago, it planned to reach that goal by 2023. Now the goal appears to have been pushed back to 2024, with the company's diversity report from last year falling short of that goal. As of last year, women make up 37% of the workforce, up just 1% since 2018 when Meta began sharing its diversity report.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company \"regularly conducts pay equity analysis, and our latest analysis confirms that we continue to have pay equity across genders globally and by race in the US for people in similar jobs (accounting for factors such as location, role and level).\"\n\nIn the reports showing an ongoing pay gap, Meta said its problem of pay inequity comes down to fewer women in technological roles. In Ireland, while the company said its workforce is almost half men and women, men hold more high-level and tech-focused jobs, according to the report.\n\n\"As tech jobs like production engineers are typically paid more in the market, it has a disproportionate impact on pay gaps,\" Meta said in the report. Similarly, equity awards and bonuses for these types of roles are also larger.\n\nIn the U.K., Meta admitted to having an ongoing problem of \"unequal representation\" in its ranks, with more men working at the company overall and in technical roles, \"particularly senior technical roles.\" The company added that most of its U.K. workforce is dedicated to engineering.\n\n\"The pool of this talent, particularly for more senior positions, continues to be predominantly male,\" Meta said in its report.",

DocuSign, the RealReal, Twilio and others have announced layoffs, each affecting hundreds of workers in the past month. Elon Musk's Twitter had an additional round of layoffs last week.\n\nMeta's workforce grew to 86,482 people at the end of 2022, up 20% from the prior year. In 2019, the company had 44,942 employees.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said 2023 was \"the year of efficiency\" on an earnings call last month.\n\n\"We're working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster, as well as deploying AI tools to help our engineers be more productive,\" he said.\n\nThe company reported fourth quarter revenue of $32 billion, beating expectations, and its stock is up 48% this year.\n\nVisit the San Francisco Chronicle at www.sfchronicle.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\nKeyWords:: 1SF-Tech-layoffs-Meta-reportedly-plans-thousands-addi 1SF Tech layoffs Meta reportedly plans thousands addi",

DocuSign, the RealReal, Twilio and others have announced layoffs, each affecting hundreds of workers in the past month. Elon Musk's Twitter had an additional round of layoffs last week.\n\nMeta's workforce grew to 86,482 people at the end of 2022, up 20% from the prior year. In 2019, the company had 44,942 employees.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said 2023 was \"the year of efficiency\" on an earnings call last month.\n\n\"We're working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster, as well as deploying AI tools to help our engineers be more productive,\" he said.\n\nThe company reported fourth quarter revenue of $32 billion, beating expectations, and its stock is up 48% this year.\n\nVisit the San Francisco Chronicle at www.sfchronicle.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\nKeyWords:: 1SF-Tech-layoffs-Meta-reportedly-plans-thousands-addi 1SF Tech layoffs Meta reportedly plans thousands addi",

                    "body": "Amid falling advertising revenue, Facebook parent Meta intends to carry out another round of layoffs that could impact thousands of employees, Bloomberg News claims.\n\nAs per insiders cited by Bloomberg, Meta has ordered directors and vice presidents to compile lists of workers who could be let go.\n\nJob cuts could begin this week, adding to the 13% of Meta's workforce already let go in November, as part of a significant cost-cutting measure.\n\nMeta has been attempting to streamline its structure by providing buyout packages to managers and cutting entire teams that it considers nonessential.\n\nSources told Bloomberg that the forthcoming round of job cuts is motivated by financial goals and is distinct from the \"flattening\" effort - a drive to cut middle management and adopt a flatter company structure, all part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's \"year of efficiency.\"\n\nThe initial round of layoffs could be completed within the next week, before Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for the birth of his third child.\n\nInsiders have told Bloomberg Meta employees are - unsurprisingly - suffering from elevated anxiety and decreased morale.\n\nSome workers have expressed concern about losing their jobs before the distribution of their bonuses, scheduled for this month.\n\nJob cuts = efficiency?\n\nLast month, the Washington Post said Meta was preparing for a new round of job cuts that would impact multiple divisions worldwide.\n\nThe report claimed Meta planned to move some of its leaders into non-management roles, cutting the layers between Zuckerberg and other employees.\n\nEven earlier, reports emerged that Meta had deliberately given significant numbers of employees \"subpar\" ratings in performance evaluations.\n\nThe intentional low ratings were interpreted as a sign the company was getting ready for more job cuts in the near future.\n\nLast month, Zuckerberg announced that 2023 would be a \"year of efficiency\" for Meta.\n\n\"We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams. When we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end. Since then, we've taken some additional steps like working with our infrastructure team on how to deliver our roadmap while spending less on capex.\"\n\nHe vowed to eliminate middle management positions and accelerate the company's decision-making procedures, intending to streamline operations and boost productivity.\n\nAs the economic slowdown began to bite, Meta investors voiced frustrations with the company's finances, such as its high headcount and annual $10 billion investment in the metaverse.\n\nFeeling the pinch\n\nMeta's business, which heavily relies on advertising, has been affected by a series of changes to advertising models, like Apple's App Tracking Transparency.\n\nMeta reported a decline in fourth-quarter profits and revenue last month.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2022, Meta's net income was $4.7 billion, a 55% drop from $10.3 billion last year.\n\nIt anticipates expenses for 2023 to be between $89 billion and $95 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the firm remains committed to its investment in metaverse efforts, which it views as the next era of mainstream computing.\n\nIn the fourth quarter the company's Reality Labs division, responsible for developing the VR and AR technologies required for metaverse success, generated $727 million in revenue.\n\nHowever, it reported an operating loss of $4.3 billion during the same period.",

                    "body": "NEW DELHI: As layoffs continue in technology companies, social media giant Facebook parent firm Meta is reportedly planning to sack more employees as early as this week. According to a report, the Mark Zuckerberg-led company could reduce jobs over and above the 13% reduction in total workforce that took place in November last year.\n\nThe reports suggest Meta has also been working towards flattening its organisation and giving buyout packages to several managers. Meta is also reportedly cutting and slashing whole teams that it deems non-essential as per its assessment. The company has completed a recent performance review of the employees, a signal that more job cuts are on the way.\n\nMeta is yet to announce a formal statement on the fresh round of layoffs. In the first round, the Silicon Valley firm had let go about 11,000 employees, constituting 13% of the entire workforce. Meta chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has titled 2023 as the 'year of efficiency' for the company which is facing pressure to generate revenues. Zuckerberg had told investors he was focused on \"continuing to streamline the company,\" during its earnings call on February 1.\n\nBeside Meta, other tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Twitter and Microsoft have also slashed their workforce as tech companies have been facing an uncertain global macroeconomic environment for the past few months. Last month, Dell said that it will be laying off 5% of its workforce- about 6,650 employees globally. According to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks layoffs, 292 tech companies have laid off 88,138 employees in 2023 alone.",

                    "body": "The second round of layoffs is reportedly being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening\" of organisation\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of job cuts and will lay off thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to a Bloomberg report quoting people familiar with the matter.\n\nThis comes after the company in November 2022 also laid off 11,000 employees or 13 per cent of its total workforce.\n\nThe report, quoting the sources, said the second round of layoffs is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening\" of organisation. Meta is also working to flatten its organisation, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems non-essential.\n\nThe latest round of layoffs is likely to be finalised in the next week, according to the Bloomberg report.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a plan to reduce costs at Meta following disappointing earnings and a drop in revenue. The staff reductions, part of the first major budget cut since the founding of Facebook in 2004, reflect a sharp slowdown in digital advertising revenue, an economy wobbling on the brink of recession and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's heavy investment in a speculative virtual-reality push called the metaverse.\n\nSeverance Package After November Layoffs\n\nZuckerberg while announcing the November layoffs gave clarity on what will happen to employees after their exit from the company. Following are the benefits that employees were entitled to after sacking.\n\nSeverance Package: Zuckerberg had said Meta will be pay 16 weeks of base pay and two additional weeks for every year of service, with no cap.\n\nPaid Time Off (PTO): The company will pay for all remaining PTO time. Paid time off or PTO is a human resource management (HRM) policy that provides employees with a pool of bankable hours that can be used for any purpose.\n\nRestricted Stock Units (RSU) Vesting: Everyone impacted will receive their November 15, 2022, vesting. An RSU is an award of stock shares, usually given as a form of employee compensation\n\nHealth Insurance: Zuckerberg had said the company will cover the cost of healthcare for people and their families for six months.\n\nCareer Services: The Meta CEO also said the firm will also provide three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads.\n\nImmigration Support: \"I know this is especially difficult if you're here on a visa. There's a notice period before termination and some visa grace periods, which means everyone will have time to make plans and work through their immigration status. We have dedicated immigration specialists to help guide you based on what you and your family need,\" Zuckerberg had said.",

Rumors have been building for weeks that the company planned another round of layoffs, even going so far as to give thousands poor performance reviews, in what many believed was a precursor.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the next round of layoffs could hit as soon as this week and will likely impact thousands of additional employees.\n\nMeta's image and reputation have already been tarnished by its layoffs. Employees have become increasingly disillusioned with the company and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership in particular. Zuckerberg is seen, both in and outside the company, as being obsessed with the metaverse.\n\nThis obsession has led some employees to believe Zuckerberg will ultimately cause the death of the company.\n\n\"The Metaverse will be our slow death,\" one user, identifying as a senior software developer, posted on the anonymous forum Blind late last year. \"Mark Zuckerberg will single-handedly kill a company with the meta-verse.\"\n\nWhen the company announced its first round of 11,000 layoffs, Zuckerberg took responsibility for the action.\n\n\"I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,\" he said at the time. \"I know this is tough for everyone, and I'm especially sorry to those impacted.\"\n\nWith another round of layoffs looming, it's a safe bet the angst at Meta is about to get a lot worse, and the company's image will continue to suffer.",

                    "body": "Social-media giant Meta Platforms, of which Zuckerberg is CEO, will reportedly cut thousands more jobs.\n\nLast November, social-media giant Meta Platforms did something unprecedented since it was created in 2004: dismiss massive numbers of employees.\n\nOn Nov. 9, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp announced the elimination of 11,000, or 13%, of its workers, injecting the austerity cure underway in Silicon Valley and the tech world in general.\n\nDon't Miss: Mark Zuckerberg Quietly Buries the Metaverse\n\nA few months later Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told analysts during the fourth-quarter-earnings call that 2023 would be the year of \"efficiency.\"\n\n\"We're working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster, as well as deploying AI tools to help our engineers be more productive,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\n\"As part of this, we're going to be more proactive about cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial, but my main focus is on increasing the efficiency of how we execute our top priorities.\"\n\nWall Street Likes Job Cuts\n\nThese cost reductions and promises that they would continue greatly pleased investors, who immediately forgave the CEO's many mistakes related to the metaverse, a virtual world that Zuckerberg flagged as Meta's Next Big Thing.\n\nThe Reality Labs unit, home to the metaverse projects, lost $4.28 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its total operating loss for 2022 to $13.72 billion.\n\nPrior to the job-cut announcements, Meta stock (META) - Get Free Report had fallen 71% between Jan. 1 and Nov. 8, 2022, translating into a market-value crash of around $681 billion. Zuckerberg's personal fortune had decreased by $88.2 billion at the time, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBut since the job cuts were announced on Nov. 9, Meta stock has rallied strongly, gaining 92% to $184.90. Zuckerberg's net worth is also building up. This year, his fortune is up $22.8 billion to $68.4 billion as of March 6, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nWhile growth uncertainties remain -- stubborn inflation forces the Federal Reserve (Fed) to continue raising interest rates -- Meta plans to continue to rely on drastic cost cuts to maintain profitability.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the social media giant is considering another massive round of job cuts this week, involving thousands of departures. The Menlo Park, Calif., company is fine-tuning these cuts, a move that has prompted high anxiety among employees, reports Bloomberg News.\n\nOne of the questions that some employees are asking themselves is whether they will receive their bonuses. Those payments were scheduled for this month.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.\n\nGrowth at Meta Is Slowing\n\nAt last check Meta stock was up in a falling market as investors seemed to -- again -- like the prospect of job cuts.\n\n\"There's going to be multiple rounds until they get right,\" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill told CNBC in an interview on March 6 about Meta. \"Wall Street doesn't want them to go down the metaverse angle. They want them to stick to their core [business].\"\n\n\"If this report is correct, and there are thousands of more jobs [cuts] coming in, it's clearly a signal that they feel like they can do more with less. And again, I think that's the theme across tech. This is not a Meta-specific issue.\"\n\nThe tech sector last year cut more than 150,000 jobs, with demand fading as the pandemic eased, according to data startup layoffs.fyi. The pace has picked up sharply this year: The sector in less than three months has slashed 125,677 jobs.\n\nMeta is going through a tough time. Last year, Meta saw its advertising revenue decline for the first time since the company went public in 2012. And its annual net income came in at $23.2 billion, 41% less than the previous year.\n\nSome 3.74 billion people use at least one of the company's services (social networks and messaging) every month. But between inflation, which is eating away at advertisers' budgets, and fierce competition from apps like TikTok, ad revenues are decreasing.\n\nThe company is also affected by changes made by Apple (AAPL) - Get Free Report, which has restricted the ability of social networks to collect user data to sell targeted advertising.\n\nLast month Meta launched a paid subscription on Facebook and Instagram to monetize new features and thus diversify its sources of revenue. Called Meta Verified, this service offers users the chance to have their Facebook and Instagram accounts verified, to ensure that an impostor or troll does not impersonate them.\n\nVerified accounts carry a blue badge. The service costs $11.99 a month for users subscribing on the web, and $14.99 a month for those using Apple's iOS operating system.\n\nMeta Verified looks like Twitter's Blue service, launched last November by Elon Musk, the platform's new owner.",

                    "body": "It's been a rollercoaster ride for Meta investors over the past few years, but this efficiency drive could help bring the company back to their core revenue drivers\n\nMeta shareholders continue to be bullish on the company's new efficiency drive, with further layoffs pushing the stock price up around 2% to $188.88 at Tuesday's open.\n\nIt gave up these gains over the rest of the day and actually finished the day slightly in the red, dragged down by hawkish comments from Fed chairman Jerome Powell over the next planned interest rate decision.\n\nIf you're considering investing in companies like Meta but you're not sure whether now's a good time to jump in, consider Q.ai's Emerging Tech Kit. It uses AI to predict and rebalance the portfolio every week, across a wide range of large cap tech stocks (like Meta), growth tech stocks, tech ETFs and crypto.\n\nSo far 2023 has been a fantastic year for Meta investors, after a horrorshow in 2022. Year to date the stock has gained almost 50%, rising from $124.74 on January 3rd to hit a closing high of $191.62.\n\nIt has since pulled back slightly from these highs, but the latest talk of further layoffs -- or 'efficiencies' in management speak -- has shareholders breathing a sigh of relief. In part because it obviously means a leaner operating model, but also because it appears that Zuckberg may finally be pausing his cash burning metaverse projects.\n\nDownload Q.ai today for access to AI-powered investment strategies.\n\nThis positive start to 2023 follows a year that most Meta investors will want to forget. For brave souls who had stayed invested through the entire year, they will have seen their stock fall from $338.54 down to $120.34.\n\nThat's a drop of 64.45%.\n\nThis included some all-time bad days for investors. The company recorded its worst single day performance ever on February 3rd, dropping 26% from $323 down to $237.76. This came off the back of a weak earnings call and the announcement of their first ever decline in daily active users.\n\nOctober 26th gave the record a run for its money, with another poor quarterly earnings call causing a drop of 24.5%, taking the stock price down below $100 for the first time since 2016, closing at $97.94\n\nAs we mentioned at the outset, Meta's stock price is up almost 50% so far in 2023. The stock closed at $184.51 on Thursday, bringing the total gain for the year to 47.92%.\n\nThe stock has been boosted by what Mark Zuckerberg is calling the 'year of efficiency'. Layoffs have obviously been a big part of this, as have plans to shelve or scale back projects that aren't working.\n\nAt last month's earnings call, Zuckerberg stated that they would proactively be looking at \"cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial.\"\n\nThese comments and layoff announcements in late 2022 drove the stock up 19.22% in January and a further 40.22% in February. So far the year of efficiency seems to be working, and it's likely necessary given that costs and expenses ballooned 22% in the year to Q4 2022, with sales dropping 4% over the same period.\n\nThis latest round of layoffs are expected to happen imminently, with Meta planning to cut thousands of employees, potentially as early as this week. So far the details of which areas of the company, which owns multiple business units including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, will be impacted.\n\nCommon sense would suggest that layoffs and cost cutting should be a bad thing from an investing standpoint. After all, it suggests that the company has made poorly judged management choices, be that hiring too many people or expanding into markets or service verticals that aren't working.\n\nBut it's important to keep in mind that stock markets are forward looking. Prices don't react based on what's happened in the past, but instead what is happening right now and what is likely to happen in the future.\n\nOnce information is made public, it becomes built into the current share price.\n\nSo when Meta announces quarterly profit figures, that moves the stock price because while it happened over the previous three months, the information is new. Once that information is out there, the stock price reacts and it is then 'priced in'.\n\nBy the same token, business decisions that investors believe will improve a company's bottom line in the future are likely to be positive for stock prices.\n\nThe story in tech for some time has been how bloated and inefficient they are. Large salaries, insane perks and expensive office spaces on the profit and loss statement make investors nervous, because they rely on sky high revenue to cover them and still turn a profit.\n\nSo when Mark Zuckerberg talks about cutting costs, that makes investors happy. Cost savings directly impact the bottom line, with the major caveat that they're able to do that while still growing or maintaining revenue.\n\nIf the 'year of efficiency' continues, then we may see strong performance continue for Meta over the rest of this year. The challenge for Zuckerberg will be to implement his efficiency drive while still growing revenue.\n\nEyes will be keenly peeled for the Q1 2023 results, which should begin to show the level of financial impact being felt by the cost cuts.\n\nIf they're able to achieve higher revenue while bringing down costs, this will improve the overall net profit margin for the company and investors are likely to be rewarded. However, if revenue falls further and the company isn't able to maintain the same operational output with a lower headcount, that could spell bad news for shareholders.\n\nThese are the serious challenges facing tech investors right now. It's a tough market for tech companies in general, and the macro economic environment with continued high inflation and the Fed trying to fight it with rising rates is really uncertain.\n\nIf you want to invest in tech (and with constant innovation happening all around us, who doesn't) but you don't know where to start, why not use cutting edge tech to invest in cutting edge tech?\n\nQ.ai's Emerging Tech Kit uses AI to predict the performance and volatility of four tech verticals -- large cap tech stocks, small cap tech stocks, tech ETFs and cryptocurrencies via public trusts -- and then automatically rebalances the Kit each week based on these predictions.\n\nNot only that, but it does the same thing for the assets within the Kit. It means that one week investors could hold Meta stock in the Kit, and the next it could be out, depending on the read from our AI.",

Meta's staff in Ireland are split between the company's international headquarters in Dublin, data centre in Clonee and Reality Lab in Cork.\n\nMicrosoft on Monday announced a further 60 cuts in Ireland, and tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Intel and Stripe have laid off a significant number of staff in recent months, largely blaming overhiring during the pandemic and the economic downturn.\n\nFor 2022, Meta reported lower revenue of $116.6bn while costs rose by 23% year-on-year from $71.2bn to $87.7bn, resulting in profit declining by 41% from \u00a339.4bn to $23.2bn.\n\nMeta reported a headcount of 86,482 at the end of 2022, accounting for a \"substantial majority\" of the 11,000 people laid off by the company. The group has 2.96bn average daily active users across its apps, which also include Instagram and WhatsApp.",

                    "body": "The Trust Project is a worldwide group of news organizations working to establish transparency standards.\n\nMeta is preparing to lay off thousands of workers in the coming week, Bloomberg reported. The sources stated that this round of layoffs might conclude in the upcoming week and could be completed before the CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, takes parental leave for his third child.\n\nMeta laid off around 11,000 employees, 13% of its workforce, four months ago to enhance its efficiency. At the time, the company said it wouldn't welcome any new employees before March 2023. Now, the social media giant is cutting down on staff even more.\n\nSources told Bloomberg that the upcoming job cuts are motivated by financial goals unrelated to the company's restructuring efforts. Meta is facing a decline in advertising revenue and is shifting its attention toward the metaverse. The company has reportedly requested its directors and vice presidents to identify employees who can be laid off.\n\nAccording to sources, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has referred to 2023 as the company's \"year of efficiency,\" which was communicated to employees during their recent performance reviews. Meta's employees are reportedly experiencing heightened anxiety and low morale, Bloomberg wrote. It's still unclear exactly how many employees will involuntarily leave the company.\n\nIt has been over five weeks since Meta discounted its latest VR headset, Quest Pro. Initially priced at $1,500, the company announced a sale on January 30, reducing the price to $1,100. Currently, the device is available for $1,000 after another price reduction. The company is probably trying to increase sales by lowering prices to make VR products more affordable to a wider audience and boost adoption. The competition in the VR market has also been growing with more headsets entering the market, and Meta could be reducing prices to stay competitive.",

                    "body": "Facebook parent entity Meta is reportedly planning to lay off thousands more employees in a second round of cuts, possibly happening as soon as this week.\n\nAs Bloomberg first reported late Monday, Meta is gearing up for a new round of layoffs this week, further dwindling a workforce that had grown considerably during the pandemic. Sources familiar with the company's plans told Bloomberg that \"thousands\" more jobs are going to be cut in this round, following layoffs in November that totaled around 11,000 lost jobs.\n\nIn an earnings call last month, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 \"the year of efficiency\" for Meta, and he said \"we're going to be more proactive about cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial.\"\n\n\"We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams,\" Zuckerberg said. \"When we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end... Next, we're working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster, as well as deploying AI tools to help our engineers be more productive.\"\n\nMeta's stock price, which peaked in September 2021 at around $379 per share, plummeted over the ensuing year, hitting a low last November of around $90 -- essentially slashing more than three quarters of the company's value in just fourteen months. The stock has since recovered a bit, but remains half the price it was at its peak, sitting at $181.51 per share as of this writing.\n\nThe previous round of cuts effected about 13% of the company's workforce, but as previously reported, the company grew by nearly 50% in terms of headcount between 2020 and 2022 -- from around 58,600 employees in 2020 to 87,000 before the November layoffs.\n\nInfluential investor Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital penned an open letter to Zuckerberg just a couple weeks before those layoffs calling for a 20% reduction in total headcount by early 2023.\n\nIn discussing the hiring spree the company went on during the pandemic, and Meta's rapid expansion into a metaverse project that is unlikely to produce dividends in the near future, Zuckerberg said in November, \"I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.\"\n\nZuckerberg told investors last month that the company's main priorities continue to be its \"AI discovery engine\" -- which it is developing for Reels to help Instagram compete better with TikTok -- and the metaverse.\n\nAs CNBC notes, Meta's sales went down 4% last year while its costs and expenses jumped 22%, and the company continues to face competition in the online advertising space as well as a depressed ad market overall.\n\nThe November layoff round only impacted 362 employees based in San Francisco, likely at the Instagram offices in 181 Fremont. We learned last month that Meta is trying to offload its entire lease at that downtown office tower, where it took out a lease of 50 floors in 2017.",

                    "title": "report: Meta preparing 'thousands' of layoffs this week",
                    "body": "Meta Platforms, parent of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, architect of a metaverse, aggregator of eyeballs, is said to be preparing to layoff employees again.\n\nAccording to a report from Bloomberg, Meta intends to part ways with \"thousands of employees\" as soon as this week. The report suggests Meta executives are working on a layoff plan to present to CEO Mark Zuckerberg prior to his planned paternity leave for the birth of his third child.\n\nMeta, when asked about this, declined to comment.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement last month for his company's Q4 2022 financial results described his strategic goals thus: \"[O]ur management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization.\"\n\nThe expected jobs cuts follow an even larger dismissal in November when the company dumped 13 percent of its staff, or about 11,000 workers. The company's headcount as of December 31 was 86,482, which includes most of those scheduled to be jettisoned in the November purge.\n\nAt the time, Zuckerberg issued a message to explain the employee disposal. \"I view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go,\" he said. \"Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate.\"\n\nOne aspect of that shift has involved asking employees who spend most of their time outside the office to share desks as a way to reduce the company's real estate costs. In its Q4 2022 earnings report Meta said it expects to spend $1 billion on restructuring charges this year related to consolidating its office facilities.\n\nTossing office space comes at a cost, though not nearly as much as the Meta Quest headset maker has spent trying to build a connected set of virtual environments. Last year, Meta posted an operating loss of $13.72 billion for its Reality Labs division. And with the disclosure of its Q3 2022 results in October last year, the company said, \"We do anticipate that Reality Labs operating losses in 2023 will grow significantly year-over-year.\"\n\nIn 2022, Meta's costs and expenses grew by 23 percent while its revenue declined one percent. And restoring past levels of revenue by selling personalized ads looks like it will be difficult now that the company's approach to targeted advertising has been found to violate EU law.\n\nLast December, in a Stanford News interview, Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, opined that tech companies are just laying people off because other tech companies are doing so. And he pointed to a study showing that layoffs are the result of companies imitating one another without a rationale for doing so.\n\nLayoffs do not cut costs, increase stock prices, or boost productivity, he said, characterizing mass job cuts as a bad decision, one that actually kills people through increased mortality in the decades following termination.\n\nAllowing that there may be a tech recession, that company valuations were too high, and that Meta may have over-hired, Pfeffer said that's not the reason tech companies are cutting jobs.\n\n\"Meta has plenty of money,\" he said. \"These companies are all making money. They are doing it because other companies are doing it.\" \u00ae",

                    "body": "The world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13 percent reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers, and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nShares gained 2.3 percent early Tuesday before closing down .21 percent at $184.51 The stock has risen 54 percent since the start of the year as of Monday's close.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before chief executive Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.",

                    "body": "Further layoffs are expected amid Mark Zuckerberg's push for a more efficient organization.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's mandate to \"flatten\" the organizational structure of Meta is getting underway, leaving employees on tenterhooks about changes to their work and expected layoffs.\n\nAbout a week ago, the company, formerly known as Facebook, began downranking unfilled jobs at the M1 level to the E6 level, according to two employees familiar with the change. An M1 at Meta is typically the first level of manager for those overseeing engineers. An E6 is a higher-level engineer that often is seen as a team leader, yet remains outside of management. The shift is part of a larger change at Meta to streamline the organization and remove some layers of management, as Insider reported.\n\nThe down leveling of the M1 roles is affecting jobs open to internal transfers, as Meta remains in a broad hiring freeze. Yet, employees suspect the change will also soon affect many current M1 managers, some of whom have as few as 5 direct reports, the people familiar said. The shift is part of what's being called \"the flattening\" by some employees, in reference to Zuckerberg's internal streamlining mandate.\n\nInside the company, changes to rank are not yet official and have not been announced, the people familiar said. Nevertheless, some managers are being told by their bosses that they will get more information on the \"opportunity to convert\" to an individual contributor, or IC, in the coming weeks and that their pay will not be affected by a change in level. Others are already preparing to be pushed out of management, set to work at the same level as employees they've been managing, as Insider reported. And another round of layoffs is also still expected to hit 5% to 10% of the company in the coming weeks, or between roughly 3,000 and 6,000 people, as Insider first reported.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said talk of changes to management and a reorganization are \"still rumor and speculation\" and reiterated a statement previously given to Insider regarding broader organizational changes.\n\n\"While we've been public about planning to flatten our org structure and remove some layers of middle management to become more efficient, that work has not been finalized, nor has anyone's role been impacted as part of that effort yet,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe squeeze on management, along with internal and some public comments from Zuckerberg, is just another sign to employees that more layoffs are on the way at Meta, as Insider reported. The company in November cut 11,000 workers and has continued to pull back on expenses, appeasing investors who became frustrated with the company's massive spending on the metaverse amid struggles with its core advertising business.\n\nStill, when performance reviews got underway at the start of this year, which are just wrapping up, they were tougher than years past. There was a directive to label more employees in lower-performing categories, as Insider first reported. And certain perks and benefits have been cut as the company closes office space, moving to a desk-sharing model while allowing employees to continue working from home.\n\nZuckerberg last month declared 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" but new CFO Susan Li is a \"major\" proponent of ongoing cost-cutting, another person familiar with the company said.\n\nMeta for many years has grown at a rapid pace, increasing headcount by 20% last year to more than 86,000 employees, according to its fourth-quarter report, although that number includes most of the people laid off in November. Management incentives have long been focused on headcount, or the size of team one leader could build. Several current and former employees have told Insider Meta's current organizational structure is \"bloated,\" but they also feel the blame should be on executive leadership for overhiring.\n\n\"There's zero trust in leadership now,\" one employee said.\n\nAnother employee said, with more layoffs expected and uncertainty around who will be pushed out, the company now feels \"incredibly toxic and everyone is distracted\" leading to less productivity. Meanwhile, the person added, management is seen \"digging into alliances, politics, and posturing for self gain.\"",

The number of heads to roll isn't clear, but Bloomberg says, citing insiders, that it's potentially \"thousands of employees as soon as this week.\" That's on top of the 11,000, or 13%, of Meta's workforce that was let go in November.\n\nMeta has been working to \"flatten\" its workforce, per Bloomberg, and has been offering buyouts and axing entire teams it deems redundant since February. Those actions could affect thousands of more workers. Shareholders apparently like the move: Meta's stock was up 2.3% in Tuesday trading, and it's up 54% since the start of the year. As Forbes explains, \"Although layoffs can signal a company is struggling, they can also be a positive sign to investors that a company is making moves to remain profitable.\" (Read more Meta stories.)",

                    "body": "Thousands of workers at the Silicon Valley tech behemoth, which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and the struggling Meta Quest VR system, could reportedly be sacked as soon as this week pending final approval from Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to go on paternity leave for his third child. The news was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, the layoffs come from the company's desire to hit financial goals -- and is distinct from a broader \"flattening\" and reduction of middle managers at the company.\n\nThe report also claims that morale at the company has been down, with workers concerned that they may lose out on their annual bonuses if they get laid off before they are disbursed.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to confirm the details of the Bloomberg report to SFGATE.\n\nThe news tracks with a worrisome February report from the Financial Times, which alleged that budget approval delays -- which would result in more layoffs -- ground productivity to a halt at Meta.\n\nBeyond broader macroeconomic challenges, Meta has been afflicted by a specific subset of struggles. Zuckerberg's virtual reality pipe dream -- manifested in the incessant push for Quest goggles and the Horizon Worlds \"metaverse\" -- has not caught any traction despite big marketing pushes and even larger investments. The company also suffered from the changing digital ad economy, seeing its first decline in ad revenue in 2022 as Apple's privacy protections continue to reverberate across the industry.\n\nBut not all workers are pessimistic about the layoffs. \"Every morning I wake up and pray it's me so I can travel,\" one Meta staffer said on the anonymous job forum Blind.",

                    "body": "Proving that Mark Zuckerberg's ominous \"year of efficiency\" is more than a catchphrase, Facebook is reportedly planning more job cuts, following the 11,000 employees laid off late last year.\n\nBloomberg reports that tech giant Facebook (now known as Meta) is planning yet another round of layoffs. According to Bloomberg, the job cuts, which could affect thousands of workers, could be announced as early as this week.\n\nThis comes on top of a 13 percent staff reduction in November 2022, when the business made its first significant layoffs by eliminating 11,000 jobs. Additionally, Facebook has been working to flatten its organizational structure by offering buyout packages to managers and eliminating unnecessary teams.\n\nSeparate from the flattening process, the most recent round of layoffs is reportedly motivated by financial goals. Due to a decline in advertising revenue, the company has shifted its attention to the metaverse, a virtual reality platform.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 to be the \"year of efficiency,\" and the business has been promoting this idea to staff members during performance reviews, which were finished last week.\n\nAccording to sources, the company's employees are experiencing anxiety and low morale due to impending job losses. Some employees are concerned that if they lose their jobs before they receive their bonuses, which are scheduled to be given out this month, they might not receive them at all.\n\nDespite the job cuts, Mark Zuckerberg seems to still be obsessed with the metaverse. By acquiring businesses like Beat Games, the developer of the well-known virtual reality game Beat Saber, and Wave, a platform for virtual concerts, Facebook has been bolstering its presence in the metaverse. The business has also invested in other initiatives connected to the metaverse, like Horizon Workrooms, which enables remote teams to communicate virtually.\n\nAlthough the metaverse is still developing, it is not yet clear how much money Facebook will be able to make from the platform. However, investors are placing their money on the project becoming a significant growth engine for the business in the coming years.\n\nThe metaverse is also drawing the attention of lawmakers concerned about how children will use the new platform.\n\nAs Breitbart News recently reported:\n\nU.S. Representatives Ken Buck (R-CO) and David Cicilline (D-RI) today sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg inquiring whether it's a good idea to allow users as young as 13 on its Horizon Worlds metaverse platform, arguing Facebook has harmed youth mental health in the past.\n\nBoth Congressmen are members of the powerful House Subcommittee on Antitrust, which has increasingly focused on the monopoly power of tech giants in recent years. Cicilline is currently the ranking member, having chaired the subcommittee in the previous congress.\n\nRead more at Bloomberg here.",

After laying off a total of 11,000 employees (the equivalent of 13% of its workforce), the firm led by Mark Zuckerberg has initiated the dismissal of thousands more workers, who will leave their jobs throughout this week, he says Bloomberg.\n\nWith this new wave of layoffs, There are more than 12,000 positions that Meta has cut since last November with the aim of becoming \"a more agile and efficient company by reducing discretionary expenses,\" said Zuckerberg. The CEO of Meta, in fact, stated after presenting his quarterly results that 2023 would be \"the year of efficiency\", and that he would carry out various strategies to reduce the company's costs.\n\nPrecisely, one of these strategies consists of abandon projects \"that are not working or can no longer be crucial\". It is, in fact, something that would also bring about the relocation of personnel or even layoffs of employees hired specifically for that project. The CEO of Meta also highlighted that it would eliminate \"the layers of intermediate management\" in order to make faster decisions.\n\nIn any case, the new wave of layoffs by Meta does not come as a surprise. In February, Financial Times revealed that the firm had delayed the finalization of budgets in several of its divisions. And that he also contemplated dispensing with more employees.\n\nFurthermore, Meta is not the only company that has carried out a second round of layoffs. Twitter beats him, who last February completed what is already his third wave of layoffs. In this case, Elon Musk, owner of the social network, laid off several employees in the sales and engineering departments with a clear objective: to improve the targeting of Twitter ads.\n\nAmazon is another of the companies that has carried out an additional wave of massive layoffs in the face of the current bad economic situation. The company founded by Jeff Bezos, in fact, is one of the big technology companies that has executed the most layoffs. More than Goal, with a total of 18,000 employees affected. Initially, Amazon confirmed that it would do without about 10,000 employees, the equivalent of % of its workforce. Later, Bezos added 8,000 more jobs to the layoff list. \"Between the reductions we made in November and the ones we share today, we plan to eliminate just over 18,000 positions,\" he noted.\n\nMeta and Amazon are followed by Google, who announced last January that it was going to do without 6% of its global workforce; some 12,000 employees. According to Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, the layoffs are part of a strategy \"to sharpen our focus, redesign our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities.\"",

According to an internal company survey from October obtained by Vox's Recode, just 28% of Meta employees had a favorable response about their optimism for the company.\n\nBloomberg's sources said the impending round of layoffs isn't directly related to Zuckerberg's flattening but has more to do with financial objectives. Directors and managers have been asked to make lists of employees who can be let go, the people revealed.\n\nRelated: Meta Imposes Strict New Policy for Restructuring Workers After 30 Days in New Ultimatum\n\nThose layoffs could be finalized in the next week, ahead of Zuckerberg's departure for parental leave for his third child, per Bloomberg.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...",

After a huge round of layoffs already took place in November 2022, it seems the tech giant is readying itself to fire even more people, internal sources claim. The parent company behind both Facebook and Instagram is pursuing an increase in efficiency, and financially, it seems that the choice might be to cut some more people off.\n\nMeta already let 11,000 employees go last year, in a move that dwarfs even Elon Musk's Twitter firing sprees. While Musk sometimes fires his employees in a very public fashion, Meta has mostly managed to avoid major public outbursts. It has, however, been accused of giving employees different severance packages.\n\nThis past year has been difficult for many, but the technology sector has seen some of the worst losses. Twitter lost a large portion of its workforce, Google made the decision to fire 12,000 employees totaling 6% of its workforce, and Amazon managed to top that by letting 18,000 people go. Other leaders in the technology space, such as Microsoft, Spotify, and Salesforce, have seen massive cuts in 2022 and 2023 as well.",

The company has also been working to flatten its organisation, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalised and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nShares were 0.2 per cent higher at 1.43pm in New York on Tuesday, paring a more than 2 per cent initial advance. The stock has risen near 50 per cent since the start of the year.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening\", said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.",

                    "title": "Meta Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs in a New Round of Layoffs",
                    "body": "The tech layoffs keep coming, with Meta planning a fresh round of job cuts, as it continues to rationalize costs, and combat lower ad intake.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Meta will cut thousands of employees, as soon as this week. This comes on the back of Meta culling 11,000 roles in November last year, as a result of the broader economic downturn, and the impact of various industry shifts.\n\nApple's iOS data privacy update (ATT) had been tagged as a key reason for Meta's initial job cuts, with many users opting out of data tracking in Meta's apps, impacting its capacity to effectively target ads. Last year, Meta estimated that Apple's ATT update alone would cost the company over $10 billion in lost ad revenue in 2022.\n\nSince then, however, Meta's automated ad targeting systems have improved, and it posted a much more positive outlook for its ad business in its Q4 results last month.\n\nBut the metaverse is evidently not catching on as Meta had hoped.\n\nAs symbolized by its corporate name change, Zuck and Co. have gone all-in on the concept of the metaverse, being a digital alternate reality of sorts, which will eventually incorporate VR, AR and everything in-between. But thus far, users and Meta investors have been far less enamored by the concept, which has played a part in this new push to reduce costs, complexity and middle management throughout the organization.\n\nZuckerberg also flagged this in the company's Q4 update, where he discussed 'flattening' the company's organizational structure, and reducing layers of management. As a result, some roles will no longer be needed, while Meta's also re-shuffling its priorities to focus more on AI and developing generative AI elements, as opposed to focusing all of its energy on VR and AR development.\n\nThose will continue to be a key target, but an internal re-think will clearly make this new AI push a bigger focus, as Meta looks to latch onto the latest tech trend.\n\nZuckerberg detailed this plan last week, saying that Meta will be 'creating a new top-level product group' focused on generative AI.\n\n\"In the short term, we'll focus on building creative and expressive tools. Over the longer term, we'll focus on developing AI personas that can help people in a variety of ways. We're exploring experiences with text (like cat in WhatsApp and Messenger), with images (like creative Instagram filters and ad formats), and with video and multi-modal experiences.\"\n\nIt seems that, within that, Meta has also found some new efficiencies, which will enable it to reduce costs, and regain some of the faith that it's lost with its investors.\n\nMeta's also still dealing with declining interest in eCommerce, which has also resulted in Meta having to abandon several key projects. Last month, Meta announced the removal of live shopping elements on Instagram, which had, at one time, been seen as a key growth area, with many experts predicting that the pandemic would lead to a bigger online shopping boom.\n\nThat didn't happen, and as a result, Meta has already cut various roles related to its shopping tools.\n\nThat's likely another element in this new cull, as Meta works to streamline its organization, and optimize its processes.\n\nIt's a time of reflection for the company, which is on the cusp of its next phase. AI will now seemingly play a bigger part in this, but the metaverse still remains its big bet.\n\nWill these cuts result in a slowdown in development of the metaverse concept, and change the trajectory of Meta in general?",

                    "body": "Meta is likely continuing its push into artificial intelligence (AI) and metaverse technology.\n\nBack in February, InvestorPlace contributor William White posed an important question: are more Facebook job cuts coming? Two weeks later, we have an unsurprising answer. Parent company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) just confirmed that more cuts are coming -- and they won't be small scale. While these Meta Platforms layoffs refer to the larger company and not Facebook specifically, it's hard to imagine that the social media giant won't be impacted.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg is planning a \"year of efficiency\" and his actions have made it clear this means reducing staff significantly. In November 2022, the company announced 11,00 job cuts. Now, reports indicate that this next round of layoffs will also be in the thousands.\n\nMETA stock is responding positively to this news today, up more than 1% as of this writing. But does that mean investors shouldn't be worried? Let's dive deeper into what this latest development may mean.\n\nThanks to the November 2022 job cuts, investors know what to expect from the incoming Meta Platforms layoffs. In short, nothing too worrisome. Since the earlier round of staff reductions, META stock has made impressive progress, rising more than 60% since mid November. This time around doesn't appear to be any different. Shares haven't risen by much today, but they are staying in the green.\n\nWhile the company has prioritized growth through \"flattening\" measures, that doesn't seem to be the driving force behind the pending layoffs. Speaking to Bloomberg, sources have confirmed that thousands of job cuts will likely be handed down as soon as this week. Per the outlet:\n\n\"The imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the 'flattening' [...] Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go.\"\n\nFew details have been provided regarding the divisions or companies that will be most impacted by these layoffs. However, the company's careers page indicates that it's still hiring in spaces like artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual and augmented reality. This suggests that Meta is continuing to focus on AI and metaverse tech at the expense of less successful projects.",

A shift in Big Tech's philosophy from centralisation to decentralisation is unlikely as the metaverse is still in its infancy.\"\n\nHowever, despite Zuckerberg's best efforts - the big metaverse chill may still bring more layoffs, misinformation and company privacy scandals as according to reports, \"without a large audience, brands will not be interested.\"\n\nThe metaverse has been promoted as a revolution in how humans socialise, consume media and work,\" and without this evidence it will be hard to see how Meta can finally start monetising its efforts.",

It was the company's first-ever significant layoff.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts last month that the company is focused on \"cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial,\" adding that the firm plans on \"removing layers of middle management to make decisions faster.\"\n\nFacebook is facing heavy competition from social media giants such as TikTok, owned by ByteDance, according to CNBC.",

                    "body": "Facebook parent company Meta is currently planning to lay off more of its workforce this week after a series of significant layoffs.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, the social media giant has been planning to trim its workforce, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting teams it deems nonessential. This move is still being finalized and could affect thousands of employees.\n\nMeanwhile, current sources familiar with the company disclosed that the current job cuts have been driven by financial targets and are separate from the trimming. The incessant job cuts ongoing at Meta shouldn't come as a surprise because the company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg had earlier given a hint on the events that would occur at the firm.\n\nJoin Tekedia Capital Syndicate and own a piece of Africa's finest startups.

He admitted his error in the company's rapid growth during the pandemic period.\n\nRecall that he had earlier indicated that Meta would be concentrating this year on efforts intended to lower the company's costs, which he described the year 2023 as the \"year of efficiency\". He disclosed to analysts last month that Meta is focused on \"cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial\", and that it plans on removing layers of middle management to make the decisions faster.\n\nThe company has been communicating its theme for the year (year of efficiency) to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week. Reports disclose that there is heightened anxiety and low morale among employees lately. Some expressed worry about whether they would receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month if they lose their jobs beforehand.\n\nThe cost-cutting efforts are coming at a challenging time for Meta, which disclosed that its cost and expenses jumped 22% year-over-year to $25.8 billion during the fourth quarter while overall sales dropped 4% to $32 billion.\n\nMeta, which has witnessed a decline in advertising revenue, has shifted focus to the virtual reality platform \"Metaverse\", asking directors and vice presidents to make a list of employees that can be let go.\n\nThe company continues to invest heavily in developing the Metaverse, which it believes could represent the next frontier for mainstream computing. The company's reality labs division which is tasked with building the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed for the Metaverse brought in $727 million in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nMeta has invested a staggering $100bn on metaverse research and development to date, $15bn in the past year alone with apparently little to show for it. The company however remains committed to advance the metaverse through a variety of areas, including Quest, mixed reality and the next generation of social experiences.",

                    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg has started delivering on his promise to make 2023 a \"year of efficiency.\"\n\nMere months after its last large-scale layoff, Meta is putting another set of jobs on the chopping block. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nSince mid-2022, Meta has been struggling to reel back costs. It spent too much, too quickly, on its big metaverse dreams while ad revenue slid due to a macroeconomic downturn and increased competition. A $12-a-month subscription for blue ticks won't be enough to make up for it all.\n\nNovember 2022: Meta trimmed its workforce by 13% last November, when it slashed 11,000 roles to save costs and increase efficiency. It was the first time since Facebook was founded 18 years ago that the company announced mass layoffs.\n\nJanuary 2023: Meta rescinds full-time offers made to a \"small number of candidates\" while it readjusts hiring priorities -- a cut of this kind is a first for the company. Engineer and writer Gergely Orosz tweeted that the decision affected around 20 new grads in London with offers due to start in February.\n\nFebruary 2023: Meta starts \"flattening\" its organizational structure, asking managers and directors to transition to individual contributor jobs -- non-managerial posts focused on coding, designing and research -- or leave. It also delays setting team budgets as it plans a fresh round of layoffs.\n\nBesides all the payrolls, there's another massive black hole that's been sucking Meta's money: the metaverse.\n\nJust after the pandemic, when everyone was working, living, and breathing online, Zuckerbeg floated the metaverse as the next big thing and touted Facebook as its leader. He went all in to create an immersive world that can be accessed through virtual reality (VR) headsets and special glasses -- albeit a slightly creepy world of floating torsos. It led to a brand and name change, and gobbled up billions of dollars in investment.\n\nBut it didn't quite catch on.\n\nNobody used Horizon Worlds, the social universe that was quickly dismissed as a poor quality video game despite Zuckerberg's insistence that it was more. In making it accessible, Meta made it subpar. And if Zuckerberg thought he could tap into the 13- to 17-year-old market to make the product work, he has to think again. US Senators are opposing the move to open the platform to teens.\n\nZuckerberg is quietly killing the metaverse and pivoting to a \"new top-level product group at Meta focused on generative AI to turbocharge our work in this area,\" as he wrote in a Feb. 27 Facebook post -- the same day OpenAI teased dialogue-based ChatGPT. The team building AI-powered products is led by Ahmad Al-Dahle, who'll report to Facebook Meta's chief product officer Chris Cox.\n\nLast month, on Feb. 24, the company introduced a new large language model called LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI. It's the core software of a new artificial intelligence system, which entails mining vast amounts of text in order to summarize information and generate content.\n\n\"In the short term, we'll focus on building creative and expressive tools. Over the longer term, we'll focus on developing AI personas that can help people in a variety of ways,\" Zuckerberg wrote in his post.\n\nFor now, the most pronounced remnant of that remains of the metaverse is the hardware-the headsets -- meant for enthusiasts like gamers and crypto fans.\n\n\"It's just flabbergasting to me that people with so many resources can so spectacularly mess things up when the opportunity to do something cool is there,\" -Celia Pearce, a professor of game design at Northeastern who has been studying non-game virtual worlds since the mid-1990s, on the Metaverse failure\n\n42%: Share of 1,000 Meta employees surveyed in October 2022 who did not understand and internalize the company's metaverse vision\n\n$24 billion: Cumulative loss amassed by Reality Labs, the division housing metaverse projects, in 2021 and 2022. Of this, $13.7 billion was last year's loss, which grew from the year before.\n\n\"About 80%...a little more\": Meta's investments going towards the core business, namely its family of apps -- Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and the ads business associated with that.\n\n\"A little less than 20%\": Meta's investment goes towards Reality Labs, as told to The New York Times Dealbook conference last November.\n\n$562 billion: The current market cap of the once trillion dollar company Meta\n\n275%: How much more expensive Meta's Quest Pro VR headset was that its predecessor Quest 2 at $1,500 when it launched five months ago\n\n$1,000: The price of Meta's Quest Pro VR headset fell 33% in the US and Canada as of Sunday (Mar. 5) as Meta brings it in line with competitors like HTC Vive XR Elite. By March 15, other markets are due to follow suit\n\n$30: The difference between the low-end, 128GB version of the Quest 2 headset at $400 and the expanded-storage 256GB Quest 2 headset, which is now retailing at $430 instead of $500\n\n20 million: Units of the Quest line sold to date, but how often are they being used? Meta Vice President for VR Mark Rabkin reportedly told employees that \"the newer cohorts that are coming in...they're just not as into it.\" Maybe the thinner 2024 variant at \"the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market\" will make it more popular.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Wall Street loved Mark Zuckerberg's plans for 2023 to be a \"year of efficiency\"\n\n\ud83d\udd74 This is what Meta might look like if Zuckerberg stepped down in 2023\n\n\ud83e\udd2b Meta's quiet firing is making a lot of noise",

                    "body": "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is gearing up for another round of layoffs that are expected to affect thousands of employees.\n\nBloomberg reports that the beleaguered social media company is expected to cut thousands more workers as soon as this week in a bid to become \"more efficient.\" After bleeding billions of dollars chasing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse, the company culled 13% of its workforce last November in a massive round of layoffs that affected 11,000 people. Apparently, that wasn't enough and more are scheduled to lose their jobs.\n\nThose familiar with the matter tell Bloomberg that directors and vice presidents have been asked to make a list of employees that could be let go, and this phase of layoffs could be finalized as soon as next week.\n\nLast year, Zuckerberg apologized to employees for the situation the company was in and took \"accountability\" for the problem as he admitted that the situation was far worse than he expected it to be. This personal responsibility for the problems at his company did not appear to mean he personally would face any consequences, but rather that he was wrong and others would lose their jobs because of it.\n\n\"Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,\" he said at the time.\n\nZuckerberg has spent billions of dollars attempting to create a new future for the company that he was sure would lie in what he called the metaverse, a poorly detailed 3D world where digital avatars didn't have legs and everything was monetized. This plan has not paid off.\n\nInstead, Zuckerberg is taking ideas from Twitter's Elon Musk in a desperate attempt to make more money. Last month, Meta announced that it would be rolling out a paid verification program to both Instagram and Facebook.\n\nThe metaverse-focused Reality Labs division has consistently lost billions of dollars -- last year, it logged a staggering $3.7 billion loss in just three months. While at the time Zuckerberg said he was still confident in the metaverse direction and it wouldn't actually pay off for a decade. Except, that might not even be true less than five months later as Zuckerberg appears to be de-emphasizing the metaverse in light of the popularity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and chatbots.",

                    "body": "Meta Platforms Inc, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and could cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13 percent reduction in November last year, in a bid to become a more efficient organization.\n\nIn its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" the people said.\n\nMeta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, the people said.\n\nThose working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which might be soon, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce.\n\nZuckerberg has dubbed this year Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta on Monday said that it would continue to release its artificial intelligence (AI) tools to approved researchers, despite claims on online message boards that its latest large language model had leaked to unauthorized users.\n\n\"While the model is not accessible to all, and some have tried to circumvent the approval process, we believe the current release strategy allows us to balance responsibility and openness,\" Meta said in a statement.\n\nFacebook owner Meta maintains a major AI research arm, and last month released LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI. Meta claimed that the model can achieve the kind of human-like conversational abilities of AI systems designed by ChatGPT creator OpenAI and Alphabet Inc while using far less computing power.\n\nLast week, users on the online forum 4Chan claimed to have made the model available for download.\n\nMeta said its LLaMA release was handled in the same way as previous models, and that it does not plan to change its strategy.\n\n\"It's Meta's goal to share state-of-the-art AI models with members of the research community to help us evaluate and improve those models,\" it said.",

                    "body": "Shares of Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, climbed nearly 1% Tuesday morning, following reports the social media giant plans to cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, even after it made one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the tech industry earlier this year.\n\nRecent tech layoffs have led to stock increases at multiple companies, including Google parent company Alphabet, as well as Spotify, Salesforce, Zoom and online furniture retailer Wayfair, as part of a phenomenon analysts believe will carry on throughout 2023. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told Forbes in January the layoffs constitute the \"first major step\" in stabilizing struggling stocks, after many tech companies hired ambitiously during the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers increasingly turned to online shopping and other online platforms. Although layoffs can signal a company is struggling, they can also be a positive sign to investors that a company is making moves to remain profitable.\n\nFollowing a wave of layoffs in the tech industry amid fears among employers that high inflation and multiple rounds of interest rate hikes could throw the economy into recession, Meta announced in November it would also be reducing its headcount, cutting roughly 11,000 employees and causing Meta's stock to climb 5% on the day. At the time, Zuckerberg called it one of the \"most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history.\" The only companies to implement bigger layoffs in recent months were Google parent company Alphabet, which announced plans in January to slash roughly 12,000 employees, and Amazon, which unveiled a plan to cut more than 18,000 positions. Last month, Meta's stock had its best day in 10 years, surging 23% following a quarterly earnings report in which the company unveiled cost-cutting measures. The recent rise in stocks erased part of a 12-month slump following Zuckerberg's decision in October 2021 to change the company's name from Facebook to Meta in an effort to \"reflect who we are and what we hope to build,\" and as the company embarked on its Metaverse online augmented and virtual reality system. Meta's stocks are still down more than 42% from October, 2021.\n\nIn February, a report in the Washington Post indicated Facebook was planning to cut thousands of jobs, and that the company was asking executives, lawyers and human resources officials to make a reorganization plan. Sources told the post the company was also planning to push some of its leaders into lower positions within the company. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone denied the report, writing in a Twitter message the Post \"got this one wrong.\" In a fourth fiscal quarter conference call last month, however, Zuckerberg admitted the company's decision to cut roughly 11,000 employees was only \"the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end.\"",

                    "body": "Facebook's parent Meta plans to kick off another round of layoffs as the company seeks to restore profitability. The move comes as the tech giant laid off 11,000 people, or 13% of its total workforce, last year to trim costs amid growing recession fears. After the news, Meta's stock went up 1.5% in premarket trading.\n\nMeta plans to lay off thousands of employees as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The new job cuts come as the world's largest social networking company seeks to become a more efficient organization.\n\nThe report detailed that financial targets are driving the upcoming round of cuts as Meta has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue. The company has reportedly asked directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be fired.\n\nThe new phase of layoffs is expected to be finalized by next week before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, Bloomberg said, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAs reported, tech companies have been aggressively downsizing their teams amid the global financial rout. However, despite the massive layoffs, most tech companies still have more workers than at the start of Covid, underscoring Big Tech's breathtaking hiring spree during the pandemic.\n\nMeta kicked off the layoffs trend among tech giants in November last year amid exacerbating financial outlook. At the time, the company announced plans to lay off 11,000 employees, the biggest last year and the first in the company's history.\n\nIn February, the company announced further plans to flatten its organization, asking many of its managers and directors to transition to individual contributor jobs or leave the company as it tries to become more efficient, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe imminent round of layoffs should not come as a surprise, given that Zuckerberg has said that 2023 will be \"the year of efficiency\" for the tech giant. \"Our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency,' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization,\" Zuckerberg said as part of the release of Meta's fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\nThe new profitability theme has positively impacted Meta stock, which has risen sharply since the start of the year. The company's shares are up more than 53% YTD, making Meta the best performer among 'Big Tech' names. However, it's still down nearly 3% on a 12-month view and is down by more than half from its 2021 peak.\n\nIt is worth noting that Meta lost billions of dollars last year on the metaverse. According to Meta's forecasts, the company's bet on the virtual world cost it $9.4 billion in 2022, and the figure could increase to a whopping $100 billion in 2023.\n\nZuckerberg previously said that it might take more than a decade before Meta can reap its metaverse rewards. During Meta's Q1 2022 earnings call, Zuckerberg said that he didn't expect the company's metaverse and XR investments to flourish until the 2030s.\n\nFurthermore, Meta's flagship metaverse platform Horizon Worlds has fallen short of expectations, forcing the company to lower its target. Reportedly, the metaverse platform is plagued with bugs and problems, and there have also been user complaints about the quality of the virtual world.\n\nNevertheless, Meta shares are currently up 1.5% in the pre-market trading amid optimism around the company's plans to trim costs and restore profitability.",

                    "body": "This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before chief executive Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.\n\nIn February, Meta said it was launching a subscription service called Meta Verified that will include a handful of additional perks and features, including Facebook and Instagram account verification badges for those who pay. It will cost US$11.99 per month -- US$14.99 if purchased through the iOS app -- and is primarily targeted toward content creators.",

                    "body": "The parent of Facebook and Instagram will eliminate more jobs on top of 11,000 layoffs announced in November\n\nFacebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms is planning thousands more layoffs, with some staffers expected to be shown the door in the next few days.\n\nThe new cuts, as reported by Bloomberg, will come on top of the 11,000 workers who lost their jobs in November, which were the first major layoffs at the social media company, whose history dates to 2004. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post at the time that the cuts were \"some of the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history.\"\n\nBloomberg noted the new cuts will come on top of efforts to downsize its management.\n\nThe new layoffs are being driven by financial targets and come at a time when many tech companies are in the midst of widespread retrenching following huge expansions during the pandemic. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo and Zoom, along with dozens of smaller Silicon Valley firms, have all cut staffs, while social media rival Twitter has reduced its workforce by more than 5,000 since Elon Musk bought the company in October.\n\nMeta last month reported revenue for the 2022 fourth quarter fell to $32.17 billion, down 4% from the last three months of 2021. Net income fell 55% to $4.7 billion for the fourth quarter and slid to $23.2 billion for all of 2022, down 41% from the prior year.\n\nThe results reflected an enormous increase in expenses and the slowdown in advertising seen across multiple industries.\n\nAs part of the financial release, Zuckerberg said that the \"management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization.\"\n\nMeta has since asked directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the company's operations.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California, company could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Meta declined to comment on the original report.\n\nThe new layoffs could be finalized within the next week, Bloomberg said. Plans call for the decisions to be made before Zuckerberg exits for parental leave after his third child's imminent birth, one person told the outlet.\n\nA new round of cuts has been widely anticipated by Meta staffers, who have been subject to a round of performance reviews that were completed last week, the report said, citing \"heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues\" along with worries that those who lose their jobs will also lose out on bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month.\n\nMeta last week cut the price of its Quest virtual reality headsets in part due to lackluster demand.\n\nShares of Meta Platforms gained $2.88, or 1.5%, to $187.78 in morning trading.

                    "body": "Meta initiated a major round of layoffs back in November, 2022. Roughly five months in, the Facebook-owner is reportedly planning a fresh round of layoffs, according to sources familiar with the matter, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBack in November, the company laid off 13 percent of its employees, resulting in roughly 11,000 jobs being lost. Now, in a bid to become a \"more efficient organization,\" Meta is laying off even more employees.\n\nWhile we don't know how many employees the company plans to layoff now, Bloomberg expects the number to be in thousands, with the company intending to finalize its plans in the next week.\n\nReportedly, Meta has also been trying to flatten its organization and is giving buyout packages to managers and shutting down teams that it considers to be nonessential.\n\nSources claim that the latest round of cuts is driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening\" of the company, which has been ongoing for some time. The company is said to be asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go. The move comes as Meta has experienced a slowdown in revenue from advertising, and has shifted its primary focus to the virtual-reality/metaverse vision.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expecting his third child soon, and thus, the company wants to finalize the layoffs in the next week, before Zuckerberg's parental leave. The Bloomberg report suggests that employees at the company are experiencing \"heightened anxiety and low morale,\" considering that they might be unemployed in the near future.\n\nMeta expanded in an unsustainable manner during the pandemic. It hired over 27,000 employees in 2020 and 2021, and 15,344 in 2022. That's more than 42,000 new employees over the course of three years, many of whom were laid off in November, and many of whom would be laid off by next week to bring the company's spending back to a sustainable level.",

According to an internal company survey from October obtained by Vox's Recode, just 28% of Meta employees had a favorable response about their optimism for the company.\n\nBloomberg's sources said the impending round of layoffs isn't directly related to Zuckerberg's flattening but has more to do with financial objectives. Directors and managers have been asked to make lists of employees who can be let go, the people revealed.\n\nRelated: Meta Imposes Strict New Policy for Restructuring Workers After 30 Days in New Ultimatum\n\nThose layoffs could be finalized in the next week, ahead of Zuckerberg's departure for parental leave for his third child, per Bloomberg.",

Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.\n\nRead more: Meta Spurred by Lackluster Demand to Cut Price of VR Headset\n\nIn February, Meta said it was launching a subscription service called Meta Verified that will include a handful of additional perks and features, including Facebook and Instagram account verification badges for those who pay.

                    "body": "Many more Meta workers may be clearing off their desks very soon. Early on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Meta plans to lay off \"thousands\" of employees, and the first round of staff cuts could be finalised as early as this week, based on anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThere's been murmurings of even more layoffs at the Mark Zuckerberg-founded company for a few weeks now, but it's been just four months since Meta axed 11,000 workers, or 13% of its global staff. CEO Zuckerberg has talked up how 2023 would be his company's \"year of efficiency\" after the company suffered losses at its \"metaverse\"-focused Reality Labs division and saw a decline in its advertising empire.\n\nIn an email to Gizmodo, Meta declined to comment on any reported plans for layoffs.\n\nThe anonymous sources quoted by Bloomberg said this new round of cuts is being driven by declining advertising revenues while it refocuses, again, on its metaverse ambitions. This is an apparent effort to help the company hit certain financial targets for 2023. The company reportedly asked team directors and vice presidents across the company to make up a list of names for those who should get the cut.\n\nZuckerberg is expecting to go on parental leave in anticipation of the birth of his third child with his wife Priscilla Chan. The reported plan is to have the layoffs set and ready to go before the big boss takes his leave of absence.\n\nIn addition to these supposed layoffs, there's a so-called \"flattening\" happening at the company's Menlo Park headquarters and beyond. Previous reports noted how Meta is putting pressure on middle managers of small teams to either get them to do more grunt work, or otherwise leave the company.",

These insiders revealed that Meta had asked directors and vice presidents to compile lists of employees who could be terminated. This comes as the world's largest social networking company has experienced a decrease in advertising earnings and dialed back investments in the metaverse.\n\nThe job cut, which could start as early as this week, will add to the November layoffs of approximately 13% of its workforce (equivalent to around 11,000 employees). Sources said the job cut would be ready before CEO Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child.\n\nZuckerberg has previously indicated 2023 will be a \"year of efficiency.\" He told analysts in February he is focused on \"cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial\" and plans on \"removing layers of middle management to make decisions faster.\"\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Meta team leaders and project managers allegedly have trouble planning their workloads due to the lack of transparency regarding the imminent headcount reduction.\n\nAs the prospect of new job cuts looms, workers at Meta have reportedly informed the Financial Times that no work is being completed.\n\n\"The year of efficiency is kicking off with a bunch of people getting paid to do nothing,\" another employee said, adding that day-to-day work \"is a mess.\"\n\nHeadcount reduction at tech companies continues full steam ahead in 2023. Website job tracker Layoffs.fyi show 461 tech companies have slashed 125,677 jobs so far this year.\n\nHere are the some of the largest tech job cuts over the last several years.",

                    "body": "In its previous round of layoffs in November, Meta eliminated 11,000 employees.\n\nFacebook parent Meta Platforms is preparing a new round of layoffs, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe report claims that the tech giant could fire thousands of workers as soon as this week.\n\nIn its previous round of layoffs, Meta eliminated 11,000 employees, marking its first-ever significant mass dismissal. The social media giant seems to be streamlining its operations amid larger market weakness. The new layoff is in addition to the previously axed reduction of 13% in November.\n\nNumerous cutbacks are occurring in the technology sector. Tracking website Layoffs.fyi estimates that 123,882 employees at 454 tech firms have lost their jobs so far this year.\n\nThe report finds that the number of jobs lost so far has already surpassed 76.75% of 2022's employment losses. Crypto businesses like Immutable, Polygon, Crypto.com, Blockchain.com, and Magic Eden have announced layoffs.\n\n2023 was dubbed the \"Year of Efficiency\" by Mark Zuckerberg in Meta's fourth-quarter earnings released in February. At the time, Zuckerberg had said that Meta would stress removing middle management layers to make quicker decisions. He also said the company will be more \"proactive on cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial.\"\n\nIt has become clear from the layoffs that the CEO wants managers to do more than manage. Mark Zuckerberg instructed them to participate in coding rather than just supervision last month. According to reports, Meta may \"flatten\" the organization's corporate structure by demoting some managers and removing their teams.\n\nThe tech giant has been forced to reevaluate operations as a result of declining advertising income and rising costs and expenses at Meta. But the Metaverse continues to be the foundation. According to CNBC, Reality Labs, the company's metaverse division, generated $727 million in revenue during the fourth quarter but also incurred an operating loss of $4.28 billion.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs division experienced a total loss of $13.7 billion in 2022. Reality Labs is Meta Platforms' business and development division, known to create augmented and virtual reality hardware and software. Despite the significant losses, the company's top boss appears eager to move forward with the plans for the Metaverse.\n\nHowever, regulators could pose another hurdle for Meta. In a recent letter to CEO Zuckerberg, two Democratic lawmakers urged he refrains from making the Horizon Worlds metaverse app available to teens due to safety worries.\n\nLast year, in an acceleration to its metaverse plans, Wayra and Meta jointly launched the Metaverse Activation Programme. Meta and Telef\u00f3nica said they had created a program to support and scale startups in the Metaverse and the Web3 sector.\n\nRecently, Zuckerberg also disclosed this month that the tech juggernaut would invest resources in building its own chatbot in response to the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",

                    "body": "Facebook parent Meta Platforms is preparing a new round of layoffs, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe report claims that the tech giant could fire thousands of workers as soon as this week.\n\n13% of Meta Staff Laid off Since November\n\nIn its previous round of layoffs, Meta eliminated 11,000 employees, marking its first-ever significant mass dismissal. The social media giant seems to be streamlining its operations amid larger market weakness. The new layoff is in addition to the previously axed reduction of 13% in November.\n\nNumerous cutbacks are occurring in the technology sector. Tracking website Layoffs.fyi estimates that 123,882 employees at 454 tech firms have lost their jobs so far this year.\n\nThe report finds that the number of jobs lost so far has already surpassed 76.75% of 2022's employment losses. Crypto businesses like Immutable, Polygon, Crypto.com, Blockchain.com, and Magic Eden have announced layoffs.\n\n\"Year of Efficiency\" Aims at Resource Optimization\n\n2023 was dubbed the \"Year of Efficiency\" by Mark Zuckerberg in Meta's fourth-quarter earnings released in February. At the time, Zuckerberg had said that Meta would stress removing middle management layers to make quicker decisions. He also said the company will be more \"proactive on cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial.\"\n\nIt has become clear from the layoffs that the CEO wants managers to do more than manage. Mark Zuckerberg instructed them to participate in coding rather than just supervision last month. According to reports, Meta may \"flatten\" the organization's corporate structure by demoting some managers and removing their teams.\n\nThe tech giant has been forced to reevaluate operations as a result of declining advertising income and rising costs and expenses at Meta. But the Metaverse continues to be the foundation. According to CNBC, Reality Labs, the company's metaverse division, generated $727 million in revenue during the fourth quarter but also incurred an operating loss of $4.28 billion.\n\nMetaverse Remains Crucial\n\nMeta's Reality Labs division experienced a total loss of $13.7 billion in 2022. Reality Labs is Meta Platforms' business and development division, known to create augmented and virtual reality hardware and software. Despite the significant losses, the company's top boss appears eager to move forward with the plans for the Metaverse.\n\nHowever, regulators could pose another hurdle for Meta. In a recent letter to CEO Zuckerberg, two Democratic lawmakers urged he refrains from making the Horizon Worlds metaverse app available to teens due to safety worries.\n\nLast year, in an acceleration to its metaverse plans, Wayra and Meta jointly launched the Metaverse Activation Programme. Meta and Telef\u00f3nica said they had created a program to support and scale startups in the Metaverse and the Web3 sector.\n\nRecently, Zuckerberg also disclosed this month that the tech juggernaut would invest resources in building its own chatbot in response to the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",

Early on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Meta plans to lay off \"thousands\" of employees, and the first round of staff cuts could start as early as this week, based on anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThere's been murmurings of even more layoffs at the Mark Zuckerberg-founded company for a few weeks now, but it's been just four months since Meta axed 11,000 workers, or 13% of its global staff. CEO Zuckerberg has talked up how 2023 would be his company's \"year of efficiency\" after the company suffered losses at its \"metaverse\"-focused Reality Labs division and saw a decline in its advertising empire.\n\nThe anonymous sources quoted by Bloomberg said this new round of cuts is being driven by declining advertising revenues while it refocuses, again, on its metaverse ambitions. This is an apparent effort to help the company hit certain financial targets for 2023. The company reportedly asked team directors and vice presidents across the company to make up a list of names for those who should get the cut.\n\nZuckerberg is expecting to go on parental leave in anticipation of the birth of his third child with his wife Priscilla Chan. The reported plan is to have the layoffs set and ready to go before the big boss takes his leave of absence.",

                    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nRelated: Breaking News: Microsoft to Include Some Azure Staff in Layoffs\n\nShares of Meta gained 1.7% during premarket trading in New York on Tuesday. The stock has risen 54% since the start of the year as of Monday's close.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.\n\nIn February, Meta said it was launching a subscription service called Meta Verified that will include a handful of additional perks and features, including Facebook and Instagram account verification badges for those who pay. It will cost $11.99 per month -- $14.99 if purchased through the iOS app -- and is primarily targeted toward content creators.",

                    "body": "Meta Platforms Inc. is set to slash thousands of more jobs this week on top of the 13% workforce reduction that CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced this past November, according to a report.\n\nThe tech giant which owns social networking behemoths Facebook and Instagram plans to notify employees within the coming days that their services are no longer needed, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nThe latest job cuts that are set to be announced this week is separate from the company's overall \"flattening\" strategy, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nMeta directors and vice presidents have been asked to compile lists of employees that are deemed expendable, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nManagement hopes to complete the new round of layoffs just before Zuckerberg goes on parental leave.\n\nIn September, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were expecting their third child -- a baby girl. The couple has two daughters -- Maxima, 7; and August, 5.\n\nZuckerberg pledged to investors earlier this year that 2023 would be Meta's \"year of efficiency.\"\n\nThe Facebook founder also instituted a new \"flattening\" policy aimed at getting rid of middle managers deemed to be standing in the way of the company being more nimble and productive.\n\nMeta has been offering nonessential managers buyout packages while cutting teams -- all part of a companywide restructuring.\n\nMeta's stock price was down slightly -- 0.19% -- in premarket trading on Tuesday.\n\nSince the start of the year, shares of Meta have rebounded, rising by some 54%.\n\nIn November, Meta shed around 13% of its global workforce of around 87,000 employees -- giving pink slips to more than 11,000 workers.\n\nThe company is trying to weather a turbulent period during which its social media properties are being squeezed by competition from TikTok.\n\nMeta's pivot to developing its metaverse technology has also sapped company resources while failing to yield a return on its investment.\n\nEmployees at Meta have been dreading fresh layoffs for weeks.\n\nLast month, staffers at the Menlo Park, Calif. campus expressed frustration over delays in approving budgets and other disruptions to the workflow.\n\n\"Honestly, it's still a mess,\" one Meta employee told Financial Times.\n\n\"The year of efficiency is kicking off with a bunch of people getting paid to do nothing.\"\n\nStaffers told FT that \"zero work\" is getting done and that decisions that normally took days to approve now take weeks or months, including in some of the company's key sectors such as the metaverse and advertising.",

                    "body": "In its first-ever mass layoff, Meta fired 11,000 employees, in November of last year.\n\nA number of crypto winters have come and gone, but none have been as severe as the one in 2022. There were widespread asset price declines, corporate closures, hacking, and layoffs. Even though we've started a whole New Year, the firing frenzy has continued unabated.\n\nBloomberg reported recently that Meta is planning to do further layoffs. According to those acquainted with the subject, thousands of workers might be impacted as soon as this week. It has been speculated that Meta is doing this \"to become a more efficient organization.\"\n\nYear of Efficiency\n\nAccording to reports, Zuckerberg has designated the year 2023 as Meta's \"year of efficiency.\" At annual performance assessments, the firm has been emphasizing this same message to its staff. It was stated last week that all of the assessments had been finished.\n\nAnonymous Bloomberg sources claim that according to those speaking on condition of anonymity about internal concerns, the upcoming wave of cutbacks is being driven by financial objectives and is different from the \"flattening.\"\n\nFurthermore, this round of layoffs may be completed in the following week. According to the reports, the business has ordered Directors and Vice Presidents to develop lists of workers who may be sacked. Meta, on the other hand, has not verified the same, and a representative refused to comment or provide any specifics to Bloomberg.\n\nMoreover, in its first-ever mass layoff, Meta fired 11,000 employees, or around 13% of its workforce, in November of last year. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO, took complete ownership of the call. Meta has been banking heavily on Metaverse and has spent billions on developing products.\n\nRecommended For You:\n\nCourt in Colombia Conducts Hearing in Metaverse Employing Horizon Worlds",

                    "body": "According to a report by Bloomberg. Meta, the parent company of both Facebook and Instagram is set to undergo another round of planned layoffs this week which has caused employees to be in a funk and full of anxiety because of the uncertainty and lack of job security at the moment.\n\nLate last year, the company laid off more than 11,000 employees across its Family of Apps and Reality Labs divisions which translates to about 13% of its entire workforce.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the company's CEO highlighted the move was prompted by the fact that the company was facing a different economic reality and that online commerce wasn't performing as well as it was at the height of the pandemic.\n\nWhat's more, last month there were reports that Meta was planning to lay off more of its workforce. The company's CEO had also highlighted that this would be a year of efficiency which would see the company's workforce cut down significantly.\n\nIn turn, current executives would also transition to lower-level positions in an attempt to enhance communication between them and the company's topmost executive, with the aim of hastening the decision-making process.\n\nAt the time, Zuckerberg also highlighted the company's intent to cut down on funding projects that were redundant and didn't add value. The new report indicates that the planned layoffs could take place as early as this week.\n\nIn this new round of layoffs, thousands of people will reportedly be affected. \"The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential,\" says Bloomberg.\n\nPer Bloomberg's report:\n\nShares of Meta gained 1.7% during premarket trading in New York on Tuesday. The stock has risen 54% since the start of the year as of Monday's close.\n\nMeta has declined to comment on the matter, though people familiar with the issue indicated that this round of job cuts will be more focused on the company hitting financial targets rather than flattening. Zuckerberg is set to go on parental leave for his third child soon, and the report detailing these planned layoffs could be ready by next week.\n\nSources familiar with the matter have also highlighted that Meta has been asking both directors and vice presidents to come up with lists citing employees that they deem redundant in specific projects and divisions.\n\nIn related news, Meta also launched a new subscription service, Meta Verified that features a verified blue badge alongside other nifty perks at $11.99/month on the web or $14.99/month on iOS and Android.\n\nMeta isn't in a unique position either, Twitter was hit by massive layoffs late last month which affected approximately 50 employees. Ex-employees believe this could be Elon Musk's way of erecting a completely new regime to run the platform.",

                    "body": "Meta has started a pilot rollout of its first paid verification service on Facebook and Instagram in Australia and New Zealand\n\nMeta Platforms Inc., the social networking giant that owns Facebook and Instagram, is planning to lay off thousands of workers as early as this week, according to a report.\n\nThe additional round of mass layoffs comes months after the company cut 11,000 jobs, about 13% of its workforce, to make it more capital efficient, Bloomberg News reported Monday. The company has been working on flattening its organization by giving buyout packages to the managers and cutting the non-essential teams. However, the new job cuts are driven by financial targets and are independent of the \"flattening\" attempts, the report said.\n\nThe plan for the layoffs that could affect thousands of workers would reportedly be finalized within the week.\n\nIn February, The Washington Post reported that Meta had plans for a fresh round of job cuts in the coming months in an attempt to reorganize and downsize the company. The report said that the company planned to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management. In addition to flattening the structure, Meta was also considering more traditional job cuts that included cutting down some projects and jobs in the months ahead.\n\nMeta hired aggressively during the pandemic anticipating rapid growth and continued even after the lockdowns ended. However, the company decided to lay off thousands in November 2022 after its revenue declined for a second consecutive quarter, losing its advertising sales to Tiktok.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement after the November layoffs.\n\nThe news about Meta's mass layoffs comes as the latest in a series of job cuts announced by several tech companies that hired rapidly during the pandemic. According to estimates, over 97,000 employees in tech companies lost their jobs in 2022.\n\nGoogle sent out emails to the employees Monday, warning that it would be promoting fewer people to senior roles this year. The announcement came weeks after the multinational tech giant trimmed around 6% of the workforce, laying off 12,000 employees.",

                    "body": "Morale among staff has plunged amid the layoffs - but Meta's stock has surged\n\nMeta is planning to slash thousands more jobs within days as billionaire owner Mark Zuckerberg keeps his promise to make 2023 a 'year of efficiency' for the firm.\n\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram is plotting a fresh round of layoffs after 11,000 jobs were axed in November.\n\nMorale among some staff is rock bottom and many are worried they won't receive their bonuses if they lose their jobs.\n\nBut Meta's stock price has surged about 54 percent since the start of the year as investors welcome the cull. The rise follows a dismal 2022 throughout which the value of the company, which also owns WhatsApp, plunged by around two thirds.\n\nInsiders told Bloomberg that executives working on the latest round of job losses want the plan ready before Zuckerberg takes parental leave for his third child, which is due imminently.\n\nMeta executives want the job cuts plan ready before owner Mark Zuckerberg takes parental leave. Zuckerberg is pictured with his wife, Priscilla, in January. The baby is due imminently\n\nMeta's stock price has surged since the beginning of 2023 as investors welcomed the cost-cutting moves\n\nThe cuts in November were the first ever major layoffs at Meta and marked an 11 percent reduction in the workforce. Zuckerberg had previously warned staff that 2023 will be a 'year of efficiency' and this ethos has been drilled into them at team meetings and in performance reviews.\n\nRoles vulnerable to the fresh job losses include HR, lawyers and financial experts. A restructure could also take place at the executive level.\n\nSome staff will be offered payoffs and others who are essentially demoted through the restructuring process could quit altogether.\n\nMeta's stock price increased around 1.6 percent in pre-market trading on Tuesday and was valued at $184.90 per share, compared with $124.74 at the beginning of 2023.\n\nAmid the sweeping cuts, one part of the business has enjoyed an increased to its budgets - Zuckerberg's heft private security bill.\n\nThe 38-year-old, whose net worth is estimated to be $68.4 billion, received a 40 percent rise in his pre-tax security allowance from $10 million to $14 million. The hike was signed off by Meta's board of directors.\n\nThat will cover just under half of his roughly $25 million annual security bill, according to reports.\n\nMeta has yet to comment on reports about the latest round of cuts, which come at a volatile time for the world's largest tech companies.\n\nThe loss of 11,000 staff in November were the first ever major layoffs at Meta and marked an 11 percent reduction in the workforce. Zuckerberg has warned 2023 will be a 'year of efficiency'\n\nA report published in January found the firms carried out an unprecedented number of job cuts in 2022.\n\nAmazon, Twitter and Uber also shed thousands of jobs.\n\nTech job cuts - including mass layoffs at Meta and Twitter\n\nA slew of tech companies have announced cost-cutting measures in 2022, with Amazon, Apple and Google-parent Alphabet all announcing hiring slowdowns or freezes.\n\nFor the tech sector, the pandemic boom turned to a post-pandemic bust, as rising interest rates batter share prices and inflation cuts into profits.\n\nThe sector shed 9,587 jobs in October, the highest monthly total since November 2020, according to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas cited by Bloomberg.\n\nTotal job cuts announced by US-based employers jumped 13 percent to 33,843 in October, the highest since February 2021, a report said.\n\nMeta\n\nThe Facebook-parent said in November it would cut 13 percent of its workforce, or more than 11,000 employees, in one of the biggest tech layoffs this year as it grapples with a weak advertising market and mounting costs.\n\nMeta cut 13 percent of its workforce, or more than 11,000 employees, in November 2022\n\nLike its peers, Meta aggressively hired during the pandemic to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers.\n\nBut but the pandemic boom-times petered out as advertisers and consumers pull the plug on spending in the face of soaring costs and rapidly rising interest rates.\n\nAfter plunging billions into CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse vision with little to show for it, Meta has been faced with rising costs and shrinking profits.\n\nMeta, once worth more than $1 trillion, lost around 70 percent of its value last year alone. Stocks have bounced back in 2023 but remained below their peak at the beginning on March.\n\n'Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected,' Zuckerberg said in a message to employees.\n\n'I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.'\n\nZuckerberg delivered the grim news about job cuts on a call with hundreds of Meta executives\n\nOn a short call, a red-eyed Zuckerberg addressed employees but took no questions.\n\nHe stuck to a script that closely followed the wording in the morning's blogpost and called the increased investments in e-commerce a 'big mistake in planning.'\n\nTwitter\n\nTwitter laid off half its workforce across teams ranging from communications and content curation to product and engineering following Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover.\n\nThe cutbacks affected roughly 3,700 employees, who learned their fate by email last week.\n\nTwitter laid off half its workforce across teams ranging from communications and content curation to product and engineering\n\nMusk previously said there was no other choice but to impose mass layoffs as the company loses hundreds of millions of dollars every year and needs a financial overhaul\n\nSalesforce\n\nIn January, cloud-based software company Salesforce announced it will layoff 10 percent of its employees or about 8,000 workers.\n\nCEO Marc Benioff cited a rough period for the tech sector as well as over-hiring during COVID-19 leading to the decision.\n\n'Our sales performance process drives accountability. Unfortunately, that can lead to some leaving the business, and we support them through their transition,' a Salesforce spokesperson said.\n\nSalesforce had 73,541 employees at the beginning of last year - it is the largest employer in the San Francisco area.\n\nThe company said in an August filing that headcount rose 36 percent in the past year 'to meet the higher demand for services from our customers.'\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon said it would layoff 18,000 corporate and technology jobs what will be the largest job cuts in the company's history.\n\nThe move comes as the company reportedly lost $1trillion over the year after its stock plummeted from a high during the pandemic.\n\nIf the company goes through with its proposal to cut 10,000 jobs, it would lose about 3 percent of Amazon's corporate employees\n\nThe move comes after the company put a hiring freeze in place, affecting major teams including Prime Video, Alexa and Amazon Fresh.\n\n'We're facing an unusual macroeconomic environment, and want to balance our hiring and investments with being thoughtful about this economy,' Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a memo.\n\nIntel\n\nIntel Corp's CEO Pat Gelsinger told Reuters 'people actions' would be part of a cost-reduction plan.\n\nThe chipmaker said recently it would reduce costs by $3 billion in 2023, then ramping that up to $10 billion by 2025.\n\nThe adjustments would start in the fourth quarter, Gelsinger said, but did not specify how many employees would be affected.\n\nSome Intel divisions, including the sales and marketing group, could be cut by up to 20 percent, Bloomberg News reported last month, citing people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nChipmaker Intel is reportedly planning major layoffs, likely numbering in the thousands, in the face of a slowdown in the personal computer market\n\nThe company had 113,700 employees as of July, when it slashed its annual sales forecast by $11 billion after missing estimates for second-quarter results.\n\nIntel, based in Santa Clara, California declined to comment on the job cuts when reached by DailyMail.com in October.\n\nIntel has been battered by shifting market trends, including the decline of traditional personal computers as smartphones and tablets rise in popularity.\n\nLast quarter, global PC shipments, including desktops and laptops, declined another 15 percent from a year ago, according to IDC.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft in January initiated layoffs of 10,000 employees, citing slowing customer demand and a negative economic environment.\n\n'We're also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one,' CEO Satya Nadella said in a company memo.\n\nThe layoffs affected nearly 5 percent of Microsoft's global workforce.\n\nMicrosoft previously laid off under 1,000 employees across several divisions last year, according to Axios.\n\nIn a statement, Microsoft executives said: 'Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities on a regular basis, and make structural adjustments accordingly.\n\nMicrosoft laid off under 1,000 employees across several divisions last month, according to Axios\n\n'We will continue to invest in our business and hire in key growth areas in the year ahead.'\n\nMicrosoft executives previously announced in July that it was laying off less than 1 percent of its workforce and significantly slow hiring, as its revenue fell short of investor expectations.\n\nThe company recorded only $51.9 billion in revenue during the second quarter of the year, but was expected to rake in $52.4 billion.\n\nIt had previously recorded blockbuster growth during the COVID pandemic, when consumers and businesses turned to its products as they shifted to a work-from-home model.\n\nLyft\n\nRide-hailing firm Lyft said it would lay off 13 percent of its workforce, or about 683 employees, after it already cut 60 jobs and froze hiring in September.\n\nLyft said in a regulatory filing it would likely incur $27 million to $32 million in restructuring charges related to the layoffs.\n\n'We are not immune to the realities of inflation and a slowing economy,' Lyft's founders wrote in the memo to staffers.\n\nRide-hailing firm Lyft said it would lay off 13 percent of its workforce, or about 683 employees, after it already cut 60 jobs earlier this year\n\nThe company's share price has fallen 76 percent since the beginning of the year and was $9.75 on March 6, compared to nearly $45 in January 2022.\n\nLyft has about 4,000 employees, not including its drivers.\n\nSpotify\n\nThe music streaming service said on January 22 it plans to cut 6% of its workforce, an estimated 588 employees from its 9,800 full time staff.\n\nSpotify said it will incur about $38million in severance-related charges.\n\nThe company, whose CEO is Daniel Ek, said its chief content and advertising business officer Dawn Ostroff will also depart.\n\nSpotify said on January 22 it plans to cut 6% of its workforce, an estimated 588 employees\n\nApple\n\nThough Apple has not yet announced any major layoffs, CEO Tim Cook told CBS Mornings that it is slowing some hiring as well.\n\n'What we're doing as a consequence of being in this period, is we're being very deliberate in our hiring,' he said. 'That means we're continuing to hire, but not everywhere in the company are we hiring.'\n\nAt the same time, though, Cook said 'we don't believe you can save your way to prosperity.\"\n\n'We think you invest your way to it,' he said.",

                    "body": "The rise means that shares of the social media company are now up slightly more than 50% year to date.\n\nAs expected, Meta Platforms rounded off 2022 with a lackluster set of financial numbers. Revenue dipped by 1% year over year to $116.7 billion, but operating income fell by 38% year over year to $28.9 billion. Net income fell sharply by 41% year over year to $23.2 billion. Exchange rates presented a headwind for the company as revenue would have grown by 4% year over year with constant currencies.\n\nOn the bright side, Meta Platforms logged a new milestone of two billion daily active users. Investors' fears over continued growth for its suite of products were put to rest, with the company seeing a 5% year over year increase in Family daily active people and a 4% year over year improvement in Family monthly active people.\n\nWhat got investors excited were CEO Mark Zuckerberg's remarks, though. He mentioned that 2023 will be deemed the \"Year of Efficiency\" as Meta Platforms sharpens its focus on profitability while spending less on capital expenditure. The company will also deploy artificial intelligence (AI) tools to increase productivity while improving monetization for its Reels product. Reels plays across both Facebook and Instagram have more than doubled year over year and show significant promise if Meta Platforms can increase this format's monetization rate.\n\nMeta Platforms is wasting no time in researching better ways to improve its products. Zuckerberg has recently announced the formation of a new division that will focus on incorporating generative AI into the company's suite of products. Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce different types of content that include text, images, and video. With new features, users can then enjoy a more personalized experience while content creators will have more options to experiment with.\n\nIn line with its new efficiency focus, Meta Platforms is now readying itself for a second round of job cuts that could happen as soon as next week. This new round of layoffs will focus on financial targets and differs from its prior round. The move will probably further reduce Meta Platform's fixed cost base to enable the company to focus on profitability.\n\nInvestors should hope that the company can produce tangible results from these moves by the end of this year and that their patience will be well-rewarded.",

                    "body": "Meta is not quite finished streamlining its workforce, with plans for another culling of thousands of employees being considered by management.\n\nIn November, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was laying off 13% of its workforce, equating to approximately 11,000 in job losses. It seems that another employment bloodbath is in the cards.\n\nA new wave of layoffs are being planned, according to Bloomberg. Thousands more employees are expected to get let go, with the fresh round hitting as soon as this week.\n\nWhile earlier rounds were apparently an attempt to flatten the organization's structure, complete with managerial buyout packages and cutting entire teams thought to be non-essential, the new round may be more money-motivated. People familiar with internal matters at Meta claim the next round is being driven by financial targets, and is separate from \"the flattening.\"\n\nAs part of the process, directors and vice presidents have been asked to produce lists of employees that they deem could be let go.\n\nThe speed of the layoffs is in part due to Zuckerberg himself, with those working on the initiative aiming to prepare it all before the CEO goes off for parental leave.\n\nThe layoff initiatives are apparently sapping morale of the workers who stay behind, with some describing heightened anxiety among colleagues. There are also fears over whether exiting workers will receive bonuses that are set to be distributed in March, which may not be awarded if they're outed beforehand.\n\nAdd in a hiring freeze that was instigated in May 2022 and blamed on Apple's App Tracking Transparency for costing Facebook $10 billion in lost revenue in 2022, and things are looking grim for the workforce.\n\nIt may be a \"year of efficiency\" for Meta's management, but to employees, it's continuing to be a year of fear and worry.\n\nRead on AppleInsider",

                    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMeta Plans Thousands More Layoffs as Soon as This WeekUS Banks Are Finally Being Forced to Raise Rates on DepositsTrump's Threat of a Third-Party Run Is Undercut by 'Sore Loser' LawsTesla Slashes Model S and X Prices for the Second Time This YearHolding Cash Will Be a Winning Strategy in 2023, Investors Say\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nShares of Meta gained 1.7% during premarket trading in New York on Tuesday. The stock has risen 54% since the start of the year as of Monday's close.\n\n\u00a9 Bloomberg Meta Became Less Efficient Than Peers After Pandemic Hiring | Revenue per additional headcount\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said.\n\nLoad Error\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.\n\nRead more: Meta Spurred by Lackluster Demand to Cut Price of VR Headset\n\nIn February, Meta said it was launching a subscription service called Meta Verified that will include a handful of additional perks and features, including Facebook and Instagram account verification badges for those who pay. It will cost $11.99 per month -- $14.99 if purchased through the iOS app -- and is primarily targeted toward content creators.\n\n(Updates with chart)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Debt Ceiling Is the Risk Wall Street Doesn't Want to Think AboutWith Gucci and Balenciaga Struggling, Kering Aims for a ResetYellowstone Backers Wanted to Cash Out -- Then the Streaming Bubble BurstFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the ExitsFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB Secrets\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "Facebook's parent company Meta is expected to announce thousands of job losses globally as early as this week, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn November the tech giant, which also owns Instagram and Whatsapp, confirmed that 11,000 jobs across its 87,000-person strong global operation were being cut, including 350 roles in Ireland.\n\nIt is now expected that the world's largest social networking company will reduce numbers further in a bid to become more 'efficient'.\n\nWhen asked by Independent.ie if additional Irish job losses were planned, a spokesperson for Meta said the company is \"not commenting\" on the reported cuts.\n\nThe spokesperson said Meta has \"nothing further to add to what Mark [Zuckerberg] posted about on the 'year of efficiency' at the beginning of February... following the earning's call\".\n\n\"In the post and earnings call he outlined the approach to managing headcount this year,\" the spokesperson added.\n\n\"Before getting into our product priorities, I want to discuss my management theme for 2023, which is the 'year of efficiency',\" Mr Zuckerberg said in February.\n\n\"We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams. When we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end. Since then, we've taken some additional steps like working with our infrastructure team on how to deliver our roadmap while spending less on capex (capital expenditure).\"\n\nThe company's founder confirmed that next \"some layers of middle management\" would be removed and projects that \"aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial\" would be cut.\n\n\"Next, we're working on flattening our org (organisation) structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster, as well as deploying AI tools to help our engineers be more productive. As part of this, we're going to be more proactive about cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial, but my main focus is on increasing the efficiency of how we execute our top priorities,\" he added.\n\nIt is understood the imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening\" outlined last month, those familiar with the matter said.\n\nIt comes as a new report from the Central Bank said tech job losses in Ireland could be as high as 2,307.\n\nThe number of layoffs already confirmed in Ireland is 1,474, or 0.9pc of the current tech workforce, a Central Bank report found. The higher number of layoffs would amount to 1.4pc of the tech sector or 6.2pc of the numbers hired during the pandemic.\n\nThe report was published before US tech giant Microsoft announced a further 60 layoffs in Ireland.",

                    "body": "Crypto winters have come and gone, but none of them have been as harsh as last year's. The space was plagued by asset price drops, company shutdowns, hacks, and mass layoffs. Despite stepping into another new calendar year, the layoff spree has been going on in full swing.\n\nA recent report from Bloomberg revealed that Meta is looking to initiate a new round of layoffs. Citing \"people familiar with the matter,\" the report highlighted that thousands of employees are likely to be affected as soon as this week. Meta is reportedly doing so \"to become a more efficient organization.\"\n\nZuckerberg has apparently labeled 2023 as Meta's \"year of efficiency.\" In fact, the company has been conveying the said theme to employees during performance reviews. The evaluations were reportedly completed last week.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's unnamed sources,\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.\n\nAlso Read: Meta Announces Layoffs that will affect 11,000 Employees\n\nThis aforementioned layoff phase could be finalized in the coming week, according to the people. According to the report, \"those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent,\" one person said.\n\nAccording to the sources, the company has asked Directors and Vice Presidents to compile \"lists of employees\" who can be fired. Meta, however, has not confirmed the same, and a spokesperson declined to comment or give more details to Bloomberg.\n\nOf late, Meta has been working to \"flatten\" its organization. It has reportedly been giving buyout packages to managers and cutting teams it considers needless. The said move is also being finalized and could affect thousands of staff.\n\nIn its first-ever mass layoff, Meta let go of 11,000 workers, accounting for around 13% of its workforce, in November last year. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took full responsibility for the decision.\n\nLeaving aside Meta, other companies also continue to reduce headcount. Towards the end of last month, Elon Musk's Twitter fired around 200 employees. Owing to the \"global economic slowdown,\" even tech giant Microsoft has been executing mass layoffs.",

                    "body": "Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nShares of Meta gained 1.7% during premarket trading in New York on Tuesday. The stock has risen 54% since the start of the year as of Monday's close.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.\n\nIn February, Meta said it was launching a subscription service called Meta Verified that will include a handful of additional perks and features, including Facebook and Instagram account verification badges for those who pay. It will cost $11.99 per month - $14.99 if purchased through the iOS app - and is primarily targeted toward content creators.",

The new round of cuts is connected to \"financial targets\" and not part of the previous \"flattening,\" which was presented as a bid to become more efficient, the outlet reported.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, has allegedly asked top management for lists of workers that could be fired. The final announcement should be made before the company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave as his third child is due soon.\n\nA number of the world's leading tech giants have announced mass layoffs in recent months, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Experts suggest that apart from global economic downturn, these cuts are prompted by the fact that many of these companies experienced growth during the pandemic, but are now finding it difficult to operate such large teams.",

                    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg said publicly that 2023 will be the \"Year of Efficiency\".\n\nMark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) plans a new round of layoffs in the company that, if confirmed, will affect thousands of workers.\n\nThe information was published this Tuesday, March 7 by Bloomberg.\n\nThe cuts will be added to the layoffs that were already applied at the end of 2022 and that affected 13 percent of Meta workers.\n\nThat more layoffs are coming is not surprising, as Zuckerberg had said the social media giant was going to focus this year on cutting the company's costs, billing 2023 as the \"Year of Efficiency.\"\n\nIn dialogue with investors, the CEO of the former Facebook said that the company was going to \"suspend projects\" that were not working or that were no longer \"essential\". He also said he planned to \"eliminate layers of middle management\" so that decisions can be made more expeditiously.\n\nThe cost reduction comes at a difficult time for the firm that controls networks such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook. The company's expenses increased 22.5 percent in 2022, up to 25.750 million dollars in the last fiscal quarter of the previous year, while sales, as a whole, fell 4.2 percent, up to 32,100 million dollars, public Bloomberg.\n\nThe biggest problem is that Meta's core online ad business is in trouble because the digital ad market has been impacted by, among other things, Apple's changes to iOS privacy policies.\n\nIn addition, it affects the strong competition from TikTok, the social network of the Chinese ByteDance.\n\nIn parallel, Meta continues to spend large sums of money on the development of the metaverse, the \"new frontier\", according to Zuckerberg, but an environment that for now is highly deficient.\n\nThe company's Reality Labs division, which is responsible for virtual reality and augmented reality technologies key to the metaverse, generated $720 million in revenue in the last fiscal quarter but operating losses of $4.28 billion.\n\nAlthough Zuckerbet said that layoffs are \"the last resort\", the truth is that he has not stopped laying off workers since things got complicated in mid-2022, when the economy began to stagnate with the end of the pandemic and the war. in Ukraine.\n\n\"We are restructuring to improve our efficiency,\" Zuckerberg said in October 2022, when he announced the layoffs that occurred in November.\n\nNow read:\n\nBasf seeks to reduce costs and joins the massive layoffs\n\nMass layoffs reach consulting firms: McKinsey's turn",

                    "body": "The world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.",

Sources reveal that the company had directed its directors and VPs to identify employees who could be let go.\n\nThe sources say that the layoff process may be concluded within a week. The team in charge of the plan reportedly intends to complete it before CEO Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may happen soon.\n\nMeta gives \"subpar\" ratings to employees\n\nAccording to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Meta assigned a \"subpar\" rating to thousands of its employees last month, indicating the possibility of further job cuts. The report also mentioned that the leadership anticipates employees leaving due to the ratings. If there are not enough departures, the company may initiate another round of layoffs, said sources.\n\nIn February, Meta published its earnings report for the fourth quarter, during which CEO Mark Zuckerberg referred to 2023 as the \"year of efficiency.\"\n\nSources tell that employees are concerned about whether they will receive their bonuses, planned to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs before the payout.\n\nIn November last year, the social-media umbrella company sacked 11,000 employees, about 13 per cent of its workforce at the time. That is not it; the company also put a hiring freeze through the first quarter of 2023.\n\nZuckerberg took responsibility for the first round of layoffs at Meta, admitting that the company had grown too rapidly during the pandemic.\n\nSo far, Meta has not said anything about a second round of layoffs.",

Why trust us?\n\nMeta is planning to embark on another round of job cuts that could see \"thousands\" of positions go, according to a Bloomberg report on Monday.\n\nThe efficiency cuts would follow mass layoffs in November when the California-based company shed 11,000 jobs globally, equal to about 13% of its workforce.\n\nSources with knowledge of the latest cuts told Bloomberg that Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is reshaping its organization to enable it to focus more on developing the so-called metaverse, a world that utlizes virtual reality for work and play and which Meta hopes will prove popular in the coming years.\n\nRelated Elon Musk reportedly tweaked algorithm to boost his tweets Instagram to soon let creators make NFTs and sell them to fans Elon Musk plans to lay off 75% of Twitter's staff, report says\n\nIt's also aiming to pivot more toward artificial intelligence (AI) products, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing at the end of last month that the company was bringing many of its AI specialists under one roof to form a unified unit in a bid to \"turbocharge\" its work in a sector that has been receiving much attention in recent months.\n\nOn top of the second round of job cuts, which Bloomberg says could be confirmed internally in the next week, Meta is reported to be considering offering some of its managers buyout packages and could also disband entire teams in a bid to streamline its operations and cut costs.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg announced thousands of layoffs in November, he described the action as \"some of the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history,\" adding that the company was \"taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.\"\n\nBattling challenging economic conditions, Meta's job cuts come alongside similar moves by other tech companies that include Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Twitter, Dell, Yahoo, PayPal, and Spotify, among others.\n\nToday's tech news, curated and condensed for your inbox Subscribe Check your inbox!

                    "body": "Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning to cut thousands of more employees as soon as this week in a fresh round of layoffs, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe report said the company is planning to offer buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it considered nonessential. Directors and vice presidents were asked to make lists of employees that can be let go.\n\nMeta in its first-ever major layoff in November last year had cut around 11,000 employees or around 13 percent of its workforce. Also, the company extended its hiring freeze through the first quarter with a small number of exceptions.\n\nWith its latest move, the social networking major is said to focus on its financial goals and become a more efficient organization amid a slowdown in advertising revenue, which accounts for the vast majority of the social network's revenue.\n\nAiming to cut costs and realign its business, the company recently announced several measures, including the layoff of around 11,000 employees, and a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate or abandon several office buildings under operating leases. The company also canceled multiple data center projects.\n\nAs part of its efforts to find more revenue sources, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg in late February announced plans to unveil a new subscription service, Meta Verified, in Australia and New Zealand this week and in more countries soon.\n\nAt the time of its previous major layoff, Zuckerberg noted that the company made the decision to significantly increase its investments as the world rapidly moved online at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way it was expected amid the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss, and its revenues were hurt.\n\nMeta is now struggling to keep up its profit and revenues, which declined 55 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in the fourth quarter from last year.\n\nZuckerberg reportedly was expecting additional cuts as he expects 2023 to be a year of efficiency for the company.\n\nThe Financial Times recently reported that there is not much clarity for Meta employees as some are being paid for zero work, and team leaders and project managers are unable to plan their workloads.\n\nMany major US tech firms, that over-hired during the COVID-19 pandemic, have been undertaking thousands of job cuts or hiring freezes amid the slowing growth, including Alphabet Inc., the parent company of search giant Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Twitter.\n\nAlphabet recently announced about 12,000 job cuts, while Microsoft announced cuts of 10,000 employees, and Amazon 18,000 employees or about 6 percent of its workforce.\n\nTwitter in late February laid off at least 50 employees in another round of job cuts over the weekend. In early November, Twitter laid off thousands of employees in a cost-cutting measure by Elon Musk, who acquired the social media company for $44 billion.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com",

The upcoming dismissals would be in addition to those.\n\nThe staff reductions are being driven by the company's financial targets, according to people familiar with the matter, as cited by the news agency.\n\nIn February, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his corporation was focused on \"cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial\" and that it plans on \"removing layers of middle management to make decisions faster.\" He also pitched 2023 as the \"Year of Efficiency,\" aimed at drastic cost cuts.\n\nThe measures followed a sharp slowdown in digital advertising revenue and disappointing earnings for the company. In September, Zuckerberg warned staff that Meta intended to slash its expenses and restructure its teams.",

It's up 53% since January 1st, making it comfortably the best performer among 'Big Tech' names. However, it's still down nearly 3% on a 12-month view, and is down by more than half from its 2021 peak.",

After firing thousands of employees in January, the big tech companies seem to be going for another round of layoffs. According to reports, Meta will start a second round of layoffs this week.\n\nAccording to a report released by Bloomberg, Meta is planning to cut off thousands of jobs, after laying off almost 13% of its workforce in order to \"enhance productivity\" in the months of November and January.\n\nAs per the report, Meta has asked Directors and Vice Presidents to list the names of the employees that can be let go in this round of layoffs.\n\n2023 will be the year of 'efficiency', Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had said. So, according to Bloomberg, this round of layoffs was very much anticipated, unlike last year's.\n\nThis time, however, Meta has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the Metaverse.\n\nSo, in short, in order to save money, so that they can invest in Metaverse, Zuckerberg's company has decided to lay off people, which will be finalised next week.\n\n2023 started with layoffs announcement from companies like Spotify, Microsoft, and Amazon. Within 25 days of the first month, 50k employees were laid off with the number now increasing to 1,53,005 people (2,732 people per day).\n\nTech companies are citing various reasons including, recession, overhiring during covid, or trying make the company more efficient as the reasons for the layoffs. Regardless of the justification, this rise in layoffs has left a lot of IT workers feeling anxious, scared, and depressed. These employees live in constant dread of being fired.\n\nREAD MORE: Get a job in 60 days or get out of US: After Twitter and Meta layoffs, H-1B visa holders plead for work",

                    "body": "Meta is planning to axe thousands of employees, per Bloomberg. These cuts could happen as soon as this week before CEO Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave. Meta already laid off 11,000 workers or approximately 13% of the company's headcount in November.\n\nMeta could be laying off thousands of staffers as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.\n\nMeta staffers who are working on plans for the layoffs hope to get them to CEO Mark Zuckerberg before he goes on parental leave, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are expecting their third child -- a girl.\n\nThis fresh round of headcount cuts is happening because of Meta's financial targets, and is separate from Zuckerberg's push for \"flattening\" Meta's organizational structure, Bloomberg's sources -- who were granted anonymity to talk about internal matters -- said.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on further layoffs, the expected number of job cuts, and which divisions might be impacted. The spokesperson did not immediately respond to Insider's follow-up query on when these reported job cuts might happen.\n\nNews of this next round of layoffs comes four months after Meta axed more than 11,000 jobs -- or approximately 13% of its workforce at the time. In February, Zuckerberg also declared that 2023 will be a \"Year of Efficiency\" for the company, and signaled during an earnings call that Meta wasn't done with axing staff.\n\n\"We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and when we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end,\" Zuckerberg said during the call with investors, Insider's Grace Kay reported.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in February that thousands of workers -- around 10% of Meta staff -- received annual reviews that indicated they were underperforming, which seemed to signal further job cuts.\n\nInsider also reported in December that Meta was demanding that its managers rank twice as many people this year as low-performing during their annual reviews. This gave the company room to let lower-ranked workers go after the performance review period, Insider reported.\n\n\"Our management theme for 2023 is the 'year of efficiency,' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization,\" Zuckerberg said at the company's fourth-quarter earnings release, dated February 1.\n\nBefore the November layoffs, around 87,314 people worked at Meta, per The New York Times. Meta said in fourth-quarter investors' report that its headcount as of December 31 was 86,482 -- but that included a \"substantial majority\" of the 11,000 people laid off in November.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

                    "body": "In the past few months, multiple big tech organizations such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM have announced major layoffs in a bid to lean out their respective organizations and nullify financial concerns about raised by some investors. After laying off more than 11,000 employees in November 2022, Meta is reportedly laying off thousands more employees very soon.\n\nA new report from Bloomberg has confirmed a previous report indicating that Meta is gearing up for another major round of layoffs. These could reportedly happen as soon as this week and will be in addition to the 13% headcount reduction from November 2022.\n\nApparently, Meta is taking a two-pronged approach with its layoffs, where it is letting go of people either to flatten the hierarchy in the company or to meet certain financial targets. In the case of the former, it is offering buyout packages to managers and letting go of entire teams deemed non-essential.\n\nHowever, these latest layoffs will actually serve to meet financial targets. As a part of this process, Meta is asking directors and vice presidents to make a list of people who can be let go without significant impact to the company.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously dubbed 2023 the \"year of efficiency\", noting that:\n\nWe're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization. Honestly, it's still a mess. The year of efficiency is kicking off with a bunch of people getting paid to do nothing.\n\nAccording to some employees, there is an environment of \"heightened anxiety and low morale\" within the company lately as workers fear getting laid off, ahead of receiving their bonuses which are expected to be distributed this month.\n\nSource: Bloomberg (paywall)",

                    "body": "Meta Platforms Inc. intends to cut several thousand more jobs, just months after cutting 11,000 employees, amid an effort to reach financial and \"efficiency\" goals.\n\nThe parent of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp could announce the cuts as soon as this week as directors and vice presidents conclude making lists of employees that can be let go, according to Bloomberg, which cites \"people familiar with the matter.\"\n\nThe anticipated cuts come after performance reviews were completed last week.\n\nThis decision comes after Meta cut 11,000 employees or approximately 13% of its workforce, in November. The fall cuts were the largest ever for the company and made apparent the company's new shift toward reorganization and prioritizing work on its virtual \"metaverse.\"\n\nLAYOFFS 2023: TECH COMPANIES LEAD JOB CUTS AMID ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\n\nAt the time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg did not rule out additional cuts and has since said 2023 would be a \"year of efficiency\" for the company, committing to \"becoming a stronger and more nimble organization.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams,\" Zuckerberg said last month, according to the Washington Post. \"When we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end.\"\n\nMeta has also set a goal to flatten its organization.\n\nBloomberg reported the new cuts consist of getting rid of nonessential employees, giving buyout packages to managers, and cutting whole teams. Other managers are being asked to transfer to non-managerial positions, which some employees have deemed demotions.\n\nMETA EMPLOYEES SAY 'ZERO WORK' GETTING DONE AS LAYOFFS LOOM: REPORT\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, employees at Meta have not been offered a lot of clarity on what they can expect going forward, leaving team leaders and project managers unable to plan their workloads.\n\nEmployees told the outlet that \"zero work\" is getting done as the new cuts loom.\n\n\"The year of efficiency is kicking off with a bunch of people getting paid to do nothing,\" another employee said, adding that day-to-day work \"is a mess.\"\n\nMARK ZUCKERBERG SAYS HE'S ACCOUNTABLE AS META PREPARES FOR LAYOFFS: REPORT\n\nThe new cuts are expected to be finalized before Zuckerberg goes on parental leave following the birth of his third child, which could happen in the coming weeks, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAccording to the report, an employee told the outlet performance reviews are typically met with bonuses -- but it is not immediately clear if the employees would be cut prior to receiving them.\n\nSeveral tech giants, including Meta, are tightening their workforces after over-hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMicrosoft Corp and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. have also cut thousands of jobs, Reuters reported.\n\nAmazon also announced its biggest round of layoffs in the company's history and paused construction on a second headquarters in Virginia.\n\nFox News' Daniella Genovese and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

                    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg-owned company is planning to lay off more employees in the coming week. This will be the second round of layoffs after Meta conducted one late last year. In the first round, the company let go of 11,000 employees, constituting 13 per cent of the entire workforce.\n\nA second round of layoffs is about to take place at Meta, the parent firm of well-known social media behemoths like Facebook and Instagram. A recent report states that Meta will let go thousands of workers as soon as this week.\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg, thousands of Meta employees will lose their jobs this week. The report cited people familiar with the matter. The report suggests that Meta has asked directors and vice presidents to list the names of the employees that can be let go in this round of layoffs.\n\nAlso Read | Which 2 qualities should new recruits have? Infosys founder Narayana Murthy reveals\n\nAfter Meta performed one at the end of last year, this will be the second round of cuts. 13% of the total staff, or 11,000 workers, were let go in the first round by the business. As a result of increased limitations in the targeted advertising area, Meta is seeing a slowdown in income. This has an effect on the business's advertising income. Additionally, the metaverse website is still not making any money.\n\n2023 has been designated as the company's \"year of efficiency\" by Meta Founder Mark Zuckerberg. A recent performance evaluation of the staff by the business may have served as a prelude to the second round of layoffs.\n\nAlso Read | Foxconn may invest $700 million in India, likely to create 1 lakh jobs: Report\n\nIn November, when Meta announced its first round of layoffs, Mark Zuckerberg held a video conference with staff members and accepted complete responsibility for the employment losses. He basically accepted responsibility for his rapid growth during the epidemic.\n\nMeta's massive bets in the field of Metaverse have also failed to payoff their investments. Meta has not confirmed the move officially.",

                    "body": "Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of lay-offs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organisation. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major lay-off, including about 350 in Ireland. The company has also been working to flatten its organisation, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems non-essential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalised and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice-presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of lay-offs could be finalised in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before chief executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said. - Bloomberg",

                    "body": "Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms announces new rounds of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees this week. These cuts aim to target the financial goals of the company after experiencing a slowdown in revenue.\n\nMeta Platforms, the world's largest social networking company, is reducing its workforce, following multiple rounds of layoffs over the past few months. According to Bloomberg's report, this could be related to the company's efforts to flatten its organization and cut teams it deems nonessential.\n\nAs per the people who asked not to be identified, these fresh cuts are being conducted by financial targets. Meta has been experiencing a slowdown in revenue, especially in advertising as it shifted its focus to Metaverse. The company has been asking directors and vice presidents to make a list of employees that will be affected by the cuts.\n\nBy next week, this phase of layoffs could be finalized. As per the report, the people behind these plans are hoping to have the list ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on a paternal leave as he expects their family's third child.\n\nThe Strait Times reported that employees from Menlo Park, which is where the Meta headquarters are located, described their heightened anxiety and low morale among their co-workers lately. Some of them expressed their frustrations on whether they will receive their bonuses this month if they lose their jobs beforehand.\n\nMeta conducted mass layoffs that affected thousands of employees last November, hitting harder than Twitter's own mass layoffs. This was considered the company's first job cut that affected a huge number of people in history, 18 years after it launched.\n\nAbout 13% of its workforce was reduced, affecting 11,00 employees. Aside from this, additional steps were also done like cutting discretionary spending and extending the company's freeze hiring. Zuckerberg stated, \"I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I'm especially sorry for those impacted.\"\n\nHe added that the company will be focusing its investments on a small number of high-priority growth areas. This means that some teams will grow meaningfully. However, some teams will stay flat or shrink over this year.\n\nAlso Read: Meta Freezes Hiring, Possible Layoffs Coming to Employees Says Mark Zuckerberg\n\nThese cuts are not surprising as TechTimes reported that Meta already expects to conduct further layoffs amid delays in annual budgets that would normally be done last month. These rumors and lack of clarity have left frustrations from the workers and lost their motivation for the company.\n\nDuring the mass layoffs last year, affected employees were given 16 weeks of base pay and additional two weeks for every year of service with no cap, paid PTO time, RSU vesting, health insurance for six months, three-month support for career services, and immigration support. It remains unclear whether Meta will be giving the same for the fresh cuts.",

                    "body": "Meta could be laying off thousands of staffers as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.\n\nMeta staffers who are working on plans for the layoffs hope to get them to CEO Mark Zuckerberg before he goes on parental leave, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are expecting their third child -- a girl.\n\nThis fresh round of headcount cuts is happening because of Meta's financial targets, and is separate from Zuckerberg's push for \"flattening\" Meta's organizational structure, Bloomberg's sources -- who were granted anonymity to talk about internal matters -- said.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on further layoffs, the expected number of job cuts, and which divisions might be impacted. The spokesperson did not immediately respond to Insider's follow-up query on when these reported job cuts might happen.\n\nNews of this next round of layoffs comes four months after Meta axed more than 11,000 jobs -- or approximately 13% of its workforce at the time. In February, Zuckerberg also declared that 2023 will be a \"Year of Efficiency\" for the company, and signaled during an earnings call that Meta wasn't done with axing staff.\n\n\"We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and when we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end,\" Zuckerberg said during the call with investors, Insider's Grace Kay reported.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in February that thousands of workers -- around 10% of Meta staff -- received annual reviews that indicated they were underperforming, which seemed to signal further job cuts.\n\nInsider also reported in December that Meta was demanding that its managers rank twice as many people this year as low-performing during their annual reviews. This gave the company room to let lower-ranked workers go after the performance review period, Insider reported.\n\n\"Our management theme for 2023 is the 'year of efficiency,' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization,\" Zuckerberg said at the company's fourth-quarter earnings release, dated February 1.\n\nBefore the November layoffs, around 87,314 people worked at Meta, per The New York Times. Meta said in fourth-quarter investors' report that its headcount as of December 31 was 86,482 -- but that included a \"substantial majority\" of the 11,000 people laid off in November.",

                    "body": "Advertisers pulling the plug on spending in 2022 triggered suffering\n\nMeta will cut thousands of jobs as soon as this week in a fresh round of layoffs, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, only a few months after the Facebook-parent reduced more than 11,000 people from its workforce.\n\nThe new round of job cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nMeta declined to comment on the Bloomberg report when contacted by Reuters.\n\nLast month, the Washington Post newspaper had reported that Meta was planning to cut jobs in a reorganization and downsizing effort. According to the report Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors in February that last year's layoffs were \"the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end.\" He said he would work on \"flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management.\"\n\nMeta, at that time, declined to comment, but spokesperson Andy Stone in a series of tweets cited several previous statements by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that more cuts were on the way.\n\nMeta's mass layoffs in November that cut more than 11,000 jobs was among the biggest last year and the first in the company's history. Other tech companies, including Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft, have also cut thousands of jobs.\n\nMeta aggressively hired during the COVID-19 pandemic to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers. But business suffered in 2022 as advertisers pulled the plug on spending in the face of rapidly rising interest rates.\n\nMeta, once worth more than $1 trillion (nearly Rs. 82,840,100 crore), is now valued at $446 billion (nearly Rs. 36,94,700 crore). Meta shares were down about 0.5 percent on Wednesday.\n\nMore than 1,00,000 layoffs were announced at US companies in January, led by technology companies, according to a report from employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",

With the company's first-ever large-scale layoff, Meta reduced employment by 11,000. The company has been striving to simplify its organization, offering buyout incentives to managers and eliminating entire teams it deems redundant, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of workers, according to Bloomberg (via NDTV).\n\nThose familiar with the matter said the upcoming round of layoffs is being driven by financial targets and is distinct from the \"flattening.\" They requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. Directors and vice presidents have reportedly been asked to compile lists of staff who can be let go at Meta as the company struggles with a decline in advertising revenue and a shift in focus to a virtual-reality platform known as the metaverse. On Monday, a representative for Meta declined to comment about the company's plans.\n\nAccording to the sources, the current round of layoffs could be completed within the next week. Plan developers want to have it done before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg takes what might be a long parental leave to care for his third child, a source said.\n\nAlthough the November layoffs were unexpected, the Meta team has known for some time that more layoffs were likely.\n\nZuckerberg has declared 2023 the \"year of efficiency\" for Meta, and the firm has been expressing this concept to staff through their recently concluded performance assessments.\n\nEmployees at the Menlo Park, California, headquarters reported that their coworkers were less confident and cheerful in recent weeks. The people said several workers were concerned they wouldn't get their bonuses if they were laid off before the end of the month when they were scheduled to be paid out.\n\nAlso Read: Twitter is no longer able to protect you against trolls, harassment, or fake news",

                    "body": "Meta Platforms Inc is considering a fresh round of layoffs and is planning to cut thousands of employees this week. Image: Reuters\n\nMeta Platforms Inc, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is considering a fresh round of layoffs and is planning to cut thousands of employees this week, Bloomberg reported citing unidentified sources. This would follow a 13 per cent reduction in workforce in November 2022, which was done to make Meta an efficient organisation. After the last round of layoffs, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a message to his employees, \"I've decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13 per cent and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.\"\n\nThe November layoffs had affected employees across departments and regions and recruitment and business teams were affected more. People who were not affected much were engineers working on projects related to the metaverse. Meta has been working to flatten the organisation, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams that it deems non-essential, Bloomberg said.\n\nNew layoffs for financial targets, separate from flattening\n\nThe upcoming round of layoffs is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the 'flattening', the sources told Bloomberg. They said that Meta has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and is now shifting focus to metaverse and has been asking directors and vice presidents to present a list of employees that can be terminated. The plan to announce the layoff is expected to be finalised before Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child.\n\nEarlier in February, Mark Zuckerberg had dubbed 2023 as Meta's \"year of efficiency\". In a statement after the release of MEta's fourth-quarter earnings report, he had said, \"Our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization.\" While Meta reported better-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter, sales still fell 4 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nLayoffs have been more or less the theme this year as well with a number of multinational companies announcing termination of their workforce. Twitter recently fired at least 200 of its workforce just days after firing dozens of employees across its sales and engineering departments. This was despite Twitter CEO Elon Musk's promise to his employees in November of 'no further layoffs' after eliminating 3,700 jobs.",

                    "body": "Meta Platforms is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, sources said.\n\nMeta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organisation.\n\nIn its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11 000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff.\n\nThe company has also been working to flatten its organisation, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, a move that is still being finalised and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening\", said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesman declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalised in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before CEO Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency\", and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said. -- Sarah Frier, Ed Ludlow and Kurt Wagner, (c) 2023 Bloomberg LP",

Other tech companies, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Microsoft Corp, have also cut thousands of jobs.",

                    "body": "Washington: Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff.\n\nThe company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nREAD MORE Facebook, Instagram roll out paid subscription in Australia, New Zealand Tech: After layoffs, CEO paycuts are the new trend - here's how much they are earning in 2023\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said",

Previously, the company fired over 11,000 employees.\n\nMETA, a California-based technology organisation that is the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, is reportedly planning to lay off more than a thousand of employees this week, claims a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe largest social media parent company, Meta, has already let go of 11,000 workers or about 13 percent of its entire workforce. With the latest update, the company has now given its thousands of employees below-par ratings, raising the possibility of further layoffs.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, the company has already offered buyout packages to managers and dismissed teams that appear to be non-contributing. Further, the report highlighted that the company is shaping the employee hierarchy and would be looking forward to cutting over a thousand jobs this week. However, the number of employees and the positions have not been mentioned as of now.\n\nAccording to the report, going through various rounds of significant layoffs is necessary to reach financial goals and survive the global economic climate presently. In a recent blog post, Meta noted that due to a slowdown in advertising revenue, the company has shifted its attention to the metaverse. Further, the company has naked the directors and vice presidents to make a list of employees that can be laid off.\n\nThe company aims to finalise the layoffs by next week, just before CEO Zuckerberg takes parental leave for his third child.\n\nWhile the widespread layoffs in November were unexpected, the subsequent round was not. On the other hand, the organisation and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have declared this year to be one of efficiency, and this is the same message given to the staff members during the performance review, according to the report.",

It will be the second in the less than 4 months when tech giant is restructuring its business and cutting its global workforce in order to make profitable. According to the people related to the development, this phase of layoffs could be finalized soon.\n\nLast year, Meta had laid off over 11,000 employees across the world, which accounted for 13% staff globally. The decision followed the slump in revenue growth and faltering of its shares.\n\nWhile sharing the annoucement of layoff, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote, \"Okay I'm sharing some of the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history. I've decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.\"\n\nMeta paid 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every years of service with no cap. Moreover, the company announced to cover the cost of healthcare for people and their families for six months.",

                    "body": "Meta plans another round of layoffs that could affect thousands of workers, according to a Bloomberg News report published Monday evening.\n\nThe job cuts could start this week and represent an additional round of layoffs, adding to the 13% of Meta workers who were laid off as part of a major cost-cutting plan announced in November.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment to CNBC about the report.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously indicated that the social networking giant would be concentrating this year on efforts intended to lower the company's costs, pitching 2023 as the \"Year of Efficiency.\" He told analysts in February that Meta is focused on \"cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial\" and that it plans on \"removing layers of middle management to make decisions faster.\"\n\nThe cost-cutting efforts come at a challenging time for the consumer technology company, which said its cost and expenses jumped 22% year-over-year to $25.8 billion during the fourth quarter while overall sales dropped 4% to $32 billion.\n\nMeta's core online advertising business continues facing hurdles because of factors including a tough digital advertising market, the lingering effects of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update and increased competition from the ByteDance-owned TikTok.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to heavily invest in developing the metaverse, which Meta believes could represent the next frontier for mainstream computing. The company's Reality Labs division, which is tasked with building the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed for the metaverse, brought in $727 million in revenue during the fourth quarter, but also recorded a $4.28 billion operating loss.\n\nZuckerberg has said that he would \"take accountability\" for the company's previously announced cost-cutting plans, saying that he views layoffs \"as a last resort.\"\n\n\"We're restructuring teams to increase our efficiency,\" Zuckerberg said last fall when Meta announced layoffs. \"But these measures alone won't bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I've also made the hard decision to let people go.\"",

                    "body": "The job cuts could start this week and represent an additional round of layoffs, adding to the 13% of Meta workers who were laid off as part of a major cost-cutting plan announced in November.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment to CNBC about the report.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously indicated that the social networking giant would be concentrating this year on efforts intended to lower the company's costs, pitching 2023 as the \"Year of Efficiency.\" He told analysts in February that Meta is focused on \"cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be crucial\" and that it plans on \"removing layers of middle management to make decisions faster.\"\n\nThe cost-cutting efforts come at a challenging time for the consumer technology company, which said its cost and expenses jumped 22% year-over-year to $25.8 billion during the fourth quarter while overall sales dropped 4% to $32 billion.\n\nMeta's core online advertising business continues facing hurdles because of factors including a tough digital advertising market, the lingering effects of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update and increased competition from the ByteDance-owned TikTok.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to heavily invest in developing the metaverse, which Meta believes could represent the next frontier for mainstream computing. The company's Reality Labs division, which is tasked with building the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed for the metaverse, brought in $727 million in revenue during the fourth quarter, but also recorded a $4.28 billion operating loss.\n\nZuckerberg has said that he would \"take accountability\" for the company's previously announced cost-cutting plans, saying that he views layoffs \"as a last resort.\"\n\n\"We're restructuring teams to increase our efficiency,\" Zuckerberg said last fall when Meta announced layoffs. \"But these measures alone won't bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I've also made the hard decision to let people go.\"",

The fall cuts were the largest ever for the company and made apparent the company's new shift toward reorganization and prioritizing work on its virtual \"metaverse.\"\n\nLAYOFFS 2023: TECH COMPANIES LEAD JOB CUTS AMID ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\n\nAt the time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg did not rule out additional cuts and has since said 2023 would be a \"year of efficiency\" for the company, committing to \"becoming a stronger and more nimble organization.\"\n\n\"We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams,\" Zuckerberg said last month, according to the Washington Post. \"When we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end.\"\n\nMeta has also set a goal to flatten its organization.\n\nBloomberg reported the new cuts consist of getting rid of nonessential employees, giving buyout packages to managers, and cutting whole teams. Other managers are being asked to transfer to non-managerial positions, which some employees have deemed demotions.\n\nMETA EMPLOYEES SAY 'ZERO WORK' GETTING DONE AS LAYOFFS LOOM: REPORT\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, employees at Meta have not been offered a lot of clarity on what they can expect going forward, leaving team leaders and project managers unable to plan their workloads.\n\nEmployees told the outlet that \"zero work\" is getting done as the new cuts loom.\n\n\"The year of efficiency is kicking off with a bunch of people getting paid to do nothing,\" another employee said, adding that day-to-day work \"is a mess.\"\n\nMARK ZUCKERBERG SAYS HE'S ACCOUNTABLE AS META PREPARES FOR LAYOFFS: REPORT\n\nThe new cuts are expected to be finalized before Zuckerberg goes on parental leave following the birth of his third child, which could happen in the coming weeks, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAccording to the report, an employee told the outlet performance reviews are typically met with bonuses -- but it is not immediately clear if the employees would be cut prior to receiving them.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSeveral tech giants, including Meta, are tightening their workforces after over-hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMicrosoft Corp and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. have also cut thousands of jobs, Reuters reported.\n\nAmazon also announced its biggest round of layoffs in the company's history and paused construction on a second headquarters in Virginia.\n\nFox News' Daniella Genovese and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

                    "body": "The world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organisation. -- Reuters\n\nMeta Platforms Inc, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organisation. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff.\n\nThe company has also been working to flatten its organisation, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems non-essential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalised and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening\", said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalised in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency\", and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said. - Bloomberg",

Bloomberg News reported Monday night that the latest round of cuts will affect thousands of Meta workers and could be announced as soon as this week. The layoffs are said to be separate from a \"flattening\" of managers and teams deemed nonessential, which Bloomberg reported in February and is still pending.\n\nIn November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 employees, its largest round of cuts ever, in a bid to become a \"leaner\" company amid a sharp drop in advertising revenue. At the time, co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Meta had grown too quickly during the pandemic, saying: \"I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.\" According the Bloomberg report Monday, Meta is aiming to finalize the latest layoff plans before Zuckerberg goes on paternity leave for his third child, which is expected soon. Meta reportedly completed performance reviews last week, and Bloomberg reported some employees are worried the layoffs will come before annual bonuses are handed out later this month. In February, the Financial Times reported Meta workers were \"demoralized\" and that little work was getting done amid the cuts. Meta shares\n\nMETA,\n\n-0.19%\n\nhave surged 54% year to date, and are down 1.4% over the past 12 months, compared to the S&P 500's\n\nSPX,\n\n+0.07%\n\n5.4% advance in 2023 and 3.6% decline over the past year.\n\n...",

Meta is yet to comment on the matter.A Wall Street Journal report last month claimed Meta gave poor performance reviews to thousands of its employees, raising fears about another round of layoffs. As per the report, more than 7,000 employees were rated \"subpar\" and the firm also got rid of a bonus metric. A source had then told WSJ that lower ratings may lead to several employees quitting their jobs.",

( Image Source : Getty )\n\nOwner of Facebook and Instagram, Meta Platforms Inc, is planning another round of fresh layoffs, citing a people familiar with the development told news agency Bloomberg. The sources told the agency that Meta is likely to slash thousands of employees as soon as this week.\n\nMeta, the world's largest social networking firm, is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13 per cent reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organisation. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff.\n\nAccording to the report, the social media giant has also been working to flatten its organisation, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg reported in February, a move that is still being finalised and could affect thousands of employees.\n\nThe sources privy to the matter said the imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening\".\n\nMeta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice-presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the sources said, while adding, this phase of layoffs could be finalised in the next week.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to Bloomberg's request for comments on the layoff plans. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, according to one of the sources.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week.\n\nEmployees at the Menlo Park, California-based firm described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the sources added.",

The layoffs are said to be separate from a \"flattening\" of managers and teams deemed nonessential, which Bloomberg reported in February and is still pending.\n\nIn November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 employees, its largest round of cuts ever, in a bid to become a \"leaner\" company amid a sharp drop in advertising revenue. At the time, co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Meta had grown too quickly during the pandemic, saying: \"I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.\"\n\nAccording the Bloomberg report Monday, Meta is aiming to finalize the latest layoff plans before Zuckerberg goes on paternity leave for his third child, which is expected soon.\n\nMeta reportedly completed performance reviews last week, and Bloomberg reported some employees are worried the layoffs will come before annual bonuses are handed out later this month. In February, the Financial Times reported Meta workers were \"demoralized\" and that little work was getting done amid the cuts.\n\nMeta shares META have surged 54% year to date, and are down 1.4% over the past 12 months, compared to the SP 500's SPX 5.4% advance in 2023 and 3.6% decline over the past year.",

The imminent round of workforce reduction is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the effort at \"flattening\" the organisation, it added.\n\nYourStory could not independently verify the report. Meta did not respond to the queries sent by YourStory at the time of publication of this news.\n\nLast month, The Washington Post had reported that the social media firm was deputising human resources, legal, finance, and top executives to develop strategies that flatten the organisation's hierarchy.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, the impending round of layoffs may be finalised in the next week. People working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, it added.\n\nThis fresh wave of layoffs, if it occurs, would follow Zuckerberg's announcement in November to reduce the size of its team by about 13%, cutting over 11,000 jobs.\n\nMeta's headcount was 86,482 as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 20% year-over-year. This includes a substantial majority of the employees impacted by the layoff, as per the company.\n\n\"Our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organisation,\" Zuckerberg had said earlier this month, as the company posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue.",

                    "body": "By Ankita Chakravarti: The layoff season is not over in Meta yet. As per reports, the Mark Zuckerberg-owned company is planning to lay off more employees in the coming week. Meta had previously laid off close to 12,000 employees. Meta (previously known as Facebook) has given \"subpar ratings\" to thousands of employees during its latest performance review, which hints at more layoffs in the coming months.\n\nAs per the Wall Street Journal, the employees were given a subpar rating. \"We've always had a goal-based culture of high performance, and our review process is intended to incentivize long-term thinking and high-quality work, while helping employees get actionable feedback,\" a Meta spokesperson told WSJ.\n\nThe report reveals that managers at Meta gave around 10 per cent of employees a rating of \"meets most\", which is the second-lowest rating at the company. The lowest rating, \"meets some\", is not something that the company gives quite often. The ratings have apparently been given to incentivize high-quality work and long-term thinking, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the senior officials at Meta expect that the low ratings will lead to more employees leaving the company in the coming weeks. If not enough employees leave voluntarily, the company may consider another round of layoffs. The ratings may have a negative impact on employees, as many may take them as a sign to look for new job opportunities.\n\nMeta has reportedly been planning to reduce its headcount further to maintain efficiency. Zuckerberg said that it wants 2023 to be the year of efficiency for Meta. This has caused some staff members to complain that \"zero work\" is getting done because managers have been unable to plan their coming workloads.\n\nIn response to these reports, Meta has stated that it is working on flattening its organizational structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster. It is also deploying AI tools to help its engineers be more productive. However, Meta did not comment on the reports about upcoming layoffs. It appears that Meta's recent performance review may be a prelude to more layoffs at the company. The low ratings given to some employees may result in more of them leaving the company, which could potentially result in another round of layoffs.",

People involved with the plan are expecting to have the list ready before Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave.\n\nIn November 2023, Meta announced 13 per cent, or more than 11,000 layoffs. The layoff on such a large scale in Meta was taking place for the first time in the company's history.\n\nFor sacked employees, Meta had promised to provide six weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service as a part of the severance package and all remaining paid time off. Apart from these, employees will get the cost of healthcare for six months.\n\nThe fresh round of job cuts at Meta were largely anticipated as Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 to be the company' s \"Year of efficiency\".",

                    "body": "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a new round of job cuts as soon as this week, with \"thousands\" of employees expected to be affected, according to a report.\n\nThe latest round of layoffs is being driven by financial targets, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing sources.\n\nIt is separate from the \"flattening\" that the company has been carrying out by offering buyout packages to managers and removing non-essential teams, the report said.\n\nThe latest phase of layoffs could be finalised within the next week, the sources said.\n\nIn November, Meta announced its first mass layoffs amid declining revenue, with roles in the technology sector most affected.\n\nThe company laid off 11,000 employees -- equal to 13 per cent of its workforce, with chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologising and taking the blame for the company's decline in revenue after disappointing earnings in October.\n\n\"I've decided to reduce the size of our team ... we are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through the first quarter,\" Mr Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nMeta, which has reported a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to its virtual reality platform Metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the report said.\n\nLast month, the social media company reported a 55 per cent annual drop in fourth-quarter net profit, underpinned by escalating costs and a decrease in the average price per advertisement.\n\nMeta earned a net profit of more than $4.6 billion in the quarter that ended on December 31.\n\nIts revenue dropped by 4.4 per cent annually to more than $32.1 billion in the three months to December. It was the company's third straight quarter of declining sales.\n\nMeta, which employs 86,482 people, expects its March quarter total sales to be in the range of $26 billion to $28.5 billion, it said.\n\nCompanies across the technology sector have been slashing their workforces after boosting hiring at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, amid rising interest rates and growing fears of a recession in US.\n\nAmazon, Microsoft, Google's parent Alphabet, Yahoo and Spotify are among the companies that have cut thousands of jobs in recent months.\n\nUS employers announced 102,943 job cuts in January, a fivefold increase on an annual basis and a 136 per cent increase from December, according to Chicago employment company Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nThe technology sector cut 41,829 jobs, accounting for 41 per cent of the total in January, a massive increase compared with the 72 cuts announced in January 2022.\n\n\"Since November 2022, which saw the highest monthly total for the sector since Challenger began tracking in 1993 ... technology companies have announced 110,793 job cuts,\" the report said.\n\n\"We're now on the other side of the hiring frenzy of the pandemic years,\" said Andrew Challenger, labour expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\n\"Companies are preparing for an economic slowdown, cutting workers and slowing hiring.\"",

                    "body": "According to a report in Bloomberg, Meta Platforms Inc., the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is planning a new round of layoffs and might fire hundreds of workers as soon as this week.\n\nIn an effort to streamline its operations, the largest social networking firm in the world is axing more positions in addition to the 13% reduction in November. In its previous wave of layoffs, Meta eliminated 11,000 employees, marking its first-ever significant mass dismissal.\n\nAccording to a February article by Bloomberg News, the corporation has also been trying to flatten its structure by offering buyout incentives to managers and disbanding entire departments it deems unnecessary. This move is still being finalised and could have an impact on thousands of employees.\n\nThe sacking is driven by financial aims\n\nAccording to the report by Bloomberg, the impending round of cuts is not related to the \"flattening\" and is being driven by financial aims. The report further states that Meta has been asking directors and vice presidents to compile names of staff who can be fired due to a slowdown in advertising revenue and a shift in focus to a virtual reality platform called the metaverse. On Monday, a Meta representative declined to comment on the proposals.\n\nThis stage of layoffs may be completed within the upcoming week. The plan's creators hope to have it completed before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg leaves work to care for his third child, which could happen soon.\n\n2023 is the year of efficiency for Meta\n\nAlthough the November layoffs came as a surprise, the Meta staff had been expecting more firings. 2023 has been named by Zuckerberg as Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the business has been promoting that idea to staff members during performance assessments, which were finished last week, according to the sources.\n\nEmployees at the Menlo Park, California-based business reported recent increases in anxiety and low morale among coworkers. Some workers expressed concern about receiving their bonuses, which are scheduled to be given out this month, if they lose their jobs first, according to the sources.",

Other tech companies, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Microsoft Corp, have also cut thousands of jobs.\n\nREAD:\n\nMeta cuts 11,000 jobs as it sinks more money into the metaverse",

                    "body": "Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organisation. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organisation, giving buyout packages to managers, and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalised and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nAlso read: Meta preparing for fresh round of job cuts: report\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalised in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before CEO Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nAlso read: Global layoffs reach three-fourth of 2022 in 51 days of 2023, India relatively insulated\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.\n\nAlso read: Amid layoffs, Big Tech companies to apply for fewer H-1B visas in CY24\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on March 7, 2023",

                    "body": "New York: Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.",

                    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe world's largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.\n\nRead more: Meta Spurred by Lackluster Demand to Cut Price of VR Headset",

In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the \"flattening,\" said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they'd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.",
