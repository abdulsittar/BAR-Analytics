                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy, which twice ravaged southern Africa, is characterized by an exceptional longevity. While it is too early to link it specifically to climate change, scientists do believe that the latter tends to make cyclones more intense.\n\nBorn in the southeast Indian Ocean, Freddy was named on February 6 by the Australian Meteorological Service.\n\nThe cyclone crossed the entire Indian Ocean from east to west, affecting Mauritius and Reunion on its long way to Madagascar and then Mozambique. It then made a loop to return to hit these last two countries as well as Malawi, a small landlocked country which pays the heaviest price.\n\nM\u00e9t\u00e9o-France describes Freddy as a \"particularly powerful and compact tropical system, generating extreme winds near its center.\n\n\"Tropical Cyclone Freddy is exceptional mainly because it lasts longer than any other recorded so far,\" said Melissa Lazenby, professor of climate change at the University of Sussex.\n\nThe Organization World Meteorological Organization (WMO) estimates that he is on track to beat the record for longevity, now held by Typhoon John, which lasted 31 days in 1994. Freddy had 34 days of activity on Friday, according to WMO.\n\nOnce it dissipates, a WMO panel of experts on climate extremes will assess all the data to determine if a new record has indeed been set. The process may take several months.\n\nAnother characteristic: Freddy has traveled more than 8000 kilometers and crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean.\n\nFinally, according to NASA, he beat the record in the southern hemisphere for an indicator called cumulative energy of tropical cyclones (known by the English acronym ACE). This measures the total energy of the winds associated with the cyclone over its lifetime.\n\nExperts are yet to comment on the specific link between Freddy and climate change, which will need to be the subject of a so-called 'attribution' study.\n\n\"However, based According to the IPCC reports, this type of extreme tropical cyclone is not surprising given the prediction that the cyclones will become more intense (categories 4-5)\", indicates Melissa Lazenby.\n\n\"The change climate contributes to stronger and more rainy tropical cyclones, and increases the risk of coastal flooding,\" said Allison Wing, associate professor at Florida State University.\n\nAccording to her, the Scientists haven't observed a trend in the frequency of tropical cyclones, but they are indeed getting more intense \"and especially the strongest storms are getting even stronger\".\n\nExperts also note a increase in recent years of the so-called rapid intensification phenomena, when the speed of the p phenomenon suddenly accelerates.",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- The devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has ripped through southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 219 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General's spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 20 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.'s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said\u202fTigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\n___\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE -- At least 190 people are now confirmed dead in Malawi after Tropical Storm Freddy ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month.\n\nTerrifying amounts of brown water have cascaded through neighborhoods, sweeping away homes. Malawi's commercial hub, Blantyre, has recorded most of the deaths, 158, including dozens of children.\n\nThe government has declared a state of disaster in 10 southern districts that have been hardest-hit by the storm. Rescue workers are overwhelmed, and are using shovels to try to find survivors buried in mud.\n\n\"We have rivers overflowing, we have people being carried away by running waters, we have buildings collapsing,\" police spokesman Peter Kalaya told the BBC.\n\nRecalling how he helped rescue a child, Blantyre resident Aaron Ntambo said: \"The child was stuck up to her head in the mud. She was crying for help. Even though the water was very strong, we managed to cross and rescue her. It was very difficult but we managed to pull her out.\"\n\nOfficials at the main referral hospital in the city said they could not cope with the sheer number of bodies that they were receiving.\n\nMedical charity Doctors Without Borders said that more than 40 children were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.\n\nOfficials appealed to bereaved families to collect the corpses for burial as the hospital's mortuary was running out of space.\n\nThe government's disaster relief agency said the death toll had risen from 99 on Monday to 190, while about 584 people were injured and 37 were still missing.\n\nMore than 20,00 people have been displaced, it added. The death toll is expected to rise as some areas remain cut off because of relentless rain and fierce wind.\n\nThe storm has also crippled Malawi's power supply, with most parts of the country experiencing prolonged blackouts.\n\nThe national electricity company said it was unable to get its hydro-power plant working as it had been filled with debris.\n\nDensely-populated poorer communities, living in brick and mud houses, have been hardest-hit. Some of these houses have crumbled into flood waters, while others have been entirely swept away.\n\nThe collapse of roads and bridges had hampered rescue operations, while helicopters could not be used either because of the heavy rains and strong winds.\n\nThe UN and other agencies have warned that the timing of the storm could exacerbate a cholera outbreak -- one of Malawi's worst public health crises.\n\nThe government has appealed for help for the tens of thousands of people who have been left without food and shelter.\n\nFreddy is the strongest tropical cyclone on record and could also be the longest-lasting one, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nOn Sunday the storm struck Mozambique as a cyclone -- for the second time in a less than a month -- after battering the island nation of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, causing severe destruction.\n\nIt has been difficult to determine the extent of the damage caused in Mozambique and the number of deaths, as power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected areas.\n\nAbout 10 deaths have so far been reported.\n\nExperts says climate change is making tropical storms around the world wetter, windier and more intense.\n\nFreddy had broken records for the strength it accumulated over the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it traveled across the Indian Ocean from north-western Australia. -- BBC",

There were no reports about deaths in the first nation, while the latter lost at least 11 people as a result of the cyclone hitting the island.Right after, Freddy struck Mozambique in late February. However, it was not the last strike of the cyclone; it returned to Mozambique on March 12, this time also hitting neighboring Malawi, the severe consequences of which made the governments of the nations take respective measures. The natural disaster has caused much destruction in all the countries involved.For instance, on March 14, Malawi declared a state of emergency in the southern regions. And in Mozambique, rescue services are working to save as many lives as they can.Check out Sputnik's gallery to discover more!",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE/MAPUTO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Tropical Cyclone Freddy has continued to cause devastation in the southern African region as the death toll from disasters such as flash floods and mudslides continues to rise.\n\nIn Malawi, where the impact of the cyclone looks the most severe, the death toll has risen to 190 as more bodies were recovered Tuesday following the damages caused by tropical cyclone Freddy, which has now affected 12 districts and cities in the southern African nation, according to the country's Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA).\n\nThe DoDMA made the announcement in its Tuesday afternoon update, with commissioner Charles Kalemba saying 158 people have died in Blantyre, the country's commercial city, alone.\n\nThe tropical cyclone started to impact Malawi Monday after it entered the province of Zambezia in Mozambique Friday, causing flooding, mudslides and strong winds damages in Malawi's 12 districts and cities.\n\nAccording to the DoDMA, nationwide, 584 people have been injured and 37 people reported missing, including three soldiers on a rescue team after their boat hit a tree and capsized. The updated report also said about 58,946 people have been affected, with approximately 19,371 of them displaced.\n\nFifty-seven camps have been set up to accommodate the displaced as rescue operations continue in the affected areas. Meanwhile, the government has extended the suspension of schools in the affected districts to March 17.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera cut short his visit to South Africa where he transited from the 5th UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Doha, Qatar, and returned to Malawi Tuesday. Upon arrival at the Kamuzu International Airport, the Malawi leader described Cyclone Freddy's impact as \"saddening\" and said he would visit the affected areas and people.\n\nTeams comprising staff from the Malawi Defense Force, Malawi Police Service, Marine Department and Malawi Red Cross Society have been deployed to carry out rescue operations in the affected districts.\n\nIn Mozambique, Malawi's neighbor, at least 10 people have also been killed and 13 others injured during the second-time passage of tropical cyclone Freddy through central Mozambique over the weekend, said an official from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management and Reduction (INGD) Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking to the press in Quelimane, the capital of central Mozambique's Zambezia Province, the INGD delegate Nelson Ludovico said that more than 22,000 people have been received in 35 temporary shelters and the total number of those affected could be much higher.\n\n\"We have 832 houses that were completely destroyed, and 1,050 houses damaged. We have 14 health units, partially or totally destroyed and we have nine impassable road sections,\" said Ludovico.\n\nAccording to a report by Mozambique's state news agency AIM, the national electricity company EDM said Monday that the number of people deprived of electricity in Zambezia, Manica and Sofala provinces has risen to 116,000.\n\nThe EDM has teams working on the ground to restore the electricity supply, but the major obstacle faced by them is the flooding caused by cyclone Freddy, which has made parts of Quelimane inaccessible, said the AIM report.\n\nCyclone Freddy tore through Mozambique from Inhambane province on Feb. 24 for the first time, causing days of bad weather and leaving 10 people killed.\n\nLocal forecasts said earlier that cyclone Freddy returned and entered the province of Zambezia Friday, and could continue to affect the region with heavy rains until Wednesday.\n\nIn Madagascar, tropical cyclone Freddy, one of the longest-tracked tropical systems of all time, has also caused casualties since February as tens of thousands are displaced.",

Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion last month as it traversed across the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.",

At least 190 people have died in Malawi, which has been particularly badly hit the the storm, and five deaths have been confirmed in Mozambique. Authorities expect the death tolls to increase.\n\nCyclone Freddy could become the longest-lasting cyclone on record, having weakened and strengthened several times. It formed north-west of Australia in early February, before moving across the Indian Ocean and battering the east African coast\n\nGot a comment? Leave your thoughts in the comments section, below.

                    "body": "Maputo - Weather officials in Mozambique are urging evacuations and bracing for heavy rain after Cyclone Freddy killed at least ten people there and scores more in neighboring Malawi.\n\nThe deputy director of Mozambique's National Institute of Meteorology, Mussa Mustafa, told VOA Tuesday they're appealing to people in risky areas to evacuate.\n\nHe said although Cyclone Freddy has weakened to a low-pressure system in neighboring Malawi, more rains are expected in Mozambique's north and west in the next two days.\n\n\"We are still in the cyclone season, but until now there is no sign of a tropical cyclone formation. But the season is still active and will need to continue monitoring the Indian Ocean, including the side of Australia, because that is where tropical Cyclone Freddy was formed and it moved towards our region,\" said Mustafa.\n\nNational public safety service spokesman Andre Tazimbua late Monday said the cyclone destroyed hundreds of homes and damaged clinics and roads.\n\nWomen walk to a nearby displacement center in Blantyre, Malawi, March 14, 2023.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing broadcast on Radio Mozambique, he said rescue teams were in Zambezia province to help victims and search for survivors.\n\nHe said their main pursuit is to enter houses where there were probably fatal victims from blown off roofs or collapsed ceilings. Tazimbua said they also want to open access routes.\n\nMozambique's Health Minister Armindo Tiago also spoke at the Monday night briefing.\n\nHe said they are preparing for potential outbreaks of water-borne disease.\n\nHe said what will happen is an increase in the level of flooding and floods, as in any rainy season, will increase the prevalence of diseases of water origin.\n\nCyclone Freddy has set a record for accumulated energy, intensifying seven times since first making landfall in February in Madagascar.\n\nThe cyclone hit Mozambique a second time on Saturday night and has devastated parts of Malawi, killed close to 100 people, and left thousands homeless.\n\nMothers and their children are seen at a displacement center in Blantyre, Malawi, March 14, 2023. The unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed more than 50 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time.\n\nFreddy appears to be the longest lasting such storm on record.\n\nMeteorologist Mustafa said the record cyclone is more evidence of extreme weather caused by climate change.\n\n\"What is important is we need to research, to investigate in our country about what is the real impact of climate change. But this (Freddy) is the evidence that we have nowadays,\" he said.\n\nMozambique in the past twenty years has been hit by seven high intensity tropical cyclones that left a trail of death and destruction.",

Severe flooding and rain damaged roads and bridges, hampering rescue efforts.\n\nIn Blantyre, mud poured into homes. Resident Aaron Ntambo:\n\n\"A child was trapped up to her head in the mud. She was crying for help. Even though the water was very strong, we managed to cross and rescue her. It was very difficult but we managed to pull her out.\"\n\nGrief-stricken families stood in line at a Blantyre mortuary waiting to identify and collect the dead.\n\nFreddy has also left a trail of destruction in Mozambique, where it made landfall over the weekend.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life is still unclear, but more than 22,000 people there were seeking shelter away from their homes.\n\nAs heavy rains continued to pummel Malawi, more than 500 people have been injured and scores are missing, according to the Department for Disaster Management Affairs.\n\nMudslides have made it difficult to get relief to those affected.\n\nFreddy could sweep through Mozambique's Zambezia province again, bringing more wind and rain.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has ripped through southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General's spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nCYCLONE FREDDY STORMS THROUGH SOUTHERN AFRICA KILLING AT LEAST 44 IN MOZAMBIQUE, MALAWI\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.'s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" saidTigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nTROPICAL CYCLONE FREDDY DROPS DANGEROUS RAINFALL OVER MOZAMBIQUE\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the Indian Ocean.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.",

The unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed more than 50 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night,\n\nBLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- The devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has ripped through southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General's spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.'s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said\u202fTigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi -- The devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has ripped through southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General's spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.'s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" saidTigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\n___",

                    "body": "Support us and go ad-free\n\nCyclone Freddy killed more than 100 people in Malawi and Mozambique on its return to southern Africa's mainland. It tore through southern Africa at the weekend for the second time within a few weeks. In total, at least 136 people have so far been killed. This includes 99 in Malawi, 20 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar. Malawi bore the brunt, counting at least 99 deaths after mudslides overnight washed away houses and sleeping occupants.\n\n\"We expect the number to rise,\" Charles Kalemba, a commissioner at the Department of Disaster Management Affairs. Another 134 people were injured, and 16 are reported missing. Malawi's commercial capital Blantyre recorded 85 deaths. According to the UN, more than 11,000 people were affected by the storm.\n\nDeadly loop\n\nThe UN's World Meteorological Organization has stated that Freddy is set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record. It formed off north-western Australia in the first week of February. Then, it crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and hit Madagascar from 21 February before first reaching Mozambique on 24 February.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a 'rare' loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique. There, at least 10 other people died and 14 were wounded. The Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management said the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\nSign up to our FREE Daily News Digest We will not share your information with third parties. Please see our Privacy Policy for information.\n\nMeteorologists say that cyclones that track across the entire Indian Ocean are very infrequent. The last such occurrences were in 2000 - and Freddy's loopback is even more exceptional.\n\nProfessor Coleen Vogel, climate change expert at South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand, said:\n\nIt's a very rare thing that these cyclones feed themselves over and over again.\n\nRelated articles New research method reveals close ties between extreme floods and rising temperatures UK climate aid funding corporate colonialism in the Global South\n\nRead on...\n\nPeople aren't expecting them to come back again once they've hit already.\n\nVogel added that climate change is \"starting to show impacts over these systems\". However, more research was needed to say this with greater certainty.\n\nDisaster response\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster in the Southern region\" of the nation. The government was responding to the crisis while appealing for local and international aid for affected families, his office said.\n\nMalawi has ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until 15 March. Rains and winds are expected to keep battering the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice. An inbound plane ran into the bad weather and was forced back to the capital, Lilongwe.\n\nThe country's energy utility also warned that electricity generation would be unstable. This is because it would have to temporarily shut down hydropower stations to prevent muddy water from damaging turbines.\n\nCompounding the situation\n\nThe impact of the cyclone has piled more woes on Malawi, which is grappling with the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history. The disease has killed over 1,600 people since last year. Worse still, UN children's agency UNICEF warned that:\n\nSevere weather events such as these are likely to exacerbate the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera.\n\nGuilherme Botelho, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) emergency project coordinator in Blantyre, states that:\n\nWe have moved the cholera treatment centres close by to the hospital to ensure the safety of the patients... The rain hasn't stopped yet and there is a lot of damage, which really worries us on many levels.\n\nIndeed, another rise in cholera cases is one of our concerns in the aftermath of this storm, especially since the vaccine coverage in Blantyre is very poor.\n\nHe went on:\n\nThe situation is very dire. There are many casualties, either wounded, missing or dead, and the numbers will only increase in the coming days.\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre is overwhelmed with the influx of casualties coming from different areas, so we have put together a team of nurses and clinical officers to provide medical and logistic support. We are also donating medical supplies and will assess if food needs to be provided to patients.\n\nAdditional reporting via Agence France-Presse\n\nFeatured image via Lauren Dauphin/Wikimedia Commons, resized to 770*403",

                    "body": "Blantyre (Malawi), Mar 14 (AP) The devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has devastated southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\nAlso Read | Meta Layoffs: Facebook Parent Company Slashes Another 10,000 Jobs.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General's spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nAlso Read | Toshakhana Policy 2023: Pakistan Government Bans Prime Minister, President, Judges From Receiving Gifts Valued Over USD 300.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.'s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nationsare strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said?Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days. (AP)",

                    "body": "An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 190 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nThe commercial hub of Blantyre in Malawi was the hardest hit district and severe flooding and rains have broken roads and bridges, hampering relief operations.\n\nThe flooding and rains have hit rescue operations and made it difficult to get relief to those affected, aid agencies said.\n\n\"It's a challenging operation in the sense that there have been incidents of mudslides, and so people are getting stuck in those mud accumulations,\" said Estere Tsoka, emergency specialist at U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Malawi.\n\n\"People are trying to find a place to hang in there for some time.\"\n\nFreddy pummeled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A 3-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast, and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told The Associated Press.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone - which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February - made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nThe death toll in Malawi has jumped to 190 from 99 on Monday, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs said. As heavy rains continued to pummel the country, 584 people have been injured, and 37 are still missing, it said in a statement.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding, and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected to weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.",

                    "body": "By Nellie Peyton\n\nJOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Reuters) - Tropical cyclone Freddy hit the coast of southern Africa for a second time over the weekend, bringing its total death toll to more than 220 people in Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar.\n\nThe month-long storm has broken at least one record and could break two more, meteorologists say.\n\nAs climate change causes warmer oceans, heat energy from the water's surface is fuelling stronger storms.\n\nBelow are some of the main reasons Freddy is noteworthy.\n\nHIGHEST CYCLONE ENERGY\n\nFreddy holds the record for most accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), a measure based on a storm's wind strength over its lifetime, of any storm in the southern hemisphere and possibly worldwide.\n\nFreddy has generated about as much accumulated cyclone energy as an average full North Atlantic hurricane season, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nBy last week it was in second place for the most accumulated cyclone energy of any storm since 1980, with the record held by Hurricane and Typhoon Ioke in 2006.\n\nSome estimates show that Freddy has since broken that record, with 86 ACE compared to Ioke's 85 ACE.\n\nRECORD LENGTH\n\nFreddy may have broken the record for longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nThe current record is held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994.\n\nFreddy first developed on Feb. 6 and made its second landfall on the coast of Mozambique on March 11, 34 days later.\n\nHowever, experts still have to look at several factors, such as the fact that it weakened below tropical cyclone status at some points during that time, in order to determine whether it broke the record, the World Meteorological Organization said.\n\nMOST CYCLES OF INTENSIFICATION\n\nFreddy appears to have broken the world record for the most bouts of rapid intensification, defined as an increase in wind speed of 35 miles per hour in a period of 24 hours.\n\nFreddy had seven separate cycles of rapid intensification, according to satellite estimates, said the World Meteorological Organization. The previous record was four, which was reached by several hurricanes.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization will set up an expert committee to examine this record, as well as the others, it said.\n\nUNUSUAL PATH\n\nFreddy developed off the coast of Australia, crossed the entire South Indian Ocean and travelled more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles) to make landfall in Madagascar and Mozambique in late February.\n\nIt then looped back and hit the coast of Mozambique again two weeks later, before moving inland to Malawi.\n\n\"No other tropical cyclones observed in this part of the world have taken such a path across the Indian Ocean in the past two decades,\" said the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in an article.\n\nOnly four storms have crossed the southern Indian Ocean from east to west, with the last one in 2000, it said.

                    "body": "JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Reuters) - Tropical cyclone Freddy hit the coast of southern Africa for a second time over the weekend, bringing its total death toll to more than 220 people in Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar.\n\nThe month-long storm has broken at least one record and could break two more, meteorologists say.\n\nAs climate change causes warmer oceans, heat energy from the water's surface is fuelling stronger storms.\n\nBelow are some of the main reasons Freddy is noteworthy.\n\nFreddy holds the record for most accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), a measure based on a storm's wind strength over its lifetime, of any storm in the southern hemisphere and possibly worldwide.\n\nFreddy has generated about as much accumulated cyclone energy as an average full North Atlantic hurricane season, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nBy last week it was in second place for the most accumulated cyclone energy of any storm since 1980, with the record held by Hurricane and Typhoon Ioke in 2006.\n\nSome estimates show that Freddy has since broken that record, with 86 ACE compared to Ioke's 85 ACE.\n\nFreddy may have broken the record for longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nThe current record is held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994.\n\nFreddy first developed on Feb. 6 and made its second landfall on the coast of Mozambique on March 11, 34 days later.\n\nHowever, experts still have to look at several factors, such as the fact that it weakened below tropical cyclone status at some points during that time, in order to determine whether it broke the record, the World Meteorological Organization said.\n\nFreddy appears to have broken the world record for the most bouts of rapid intensification, defined as an increase in wind speed of 35 miles per hour in a period of 24 hours.\n\nFreddy had seven separate cycles of rapid intensification, according to satellite estimates, said the World Meteorological Organization. The previous record was four, which was reached by several hurricanes.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization will set up an expert committee to examine this record, as well as the others, it said.\n\nFreddy developed off the coast of Australia, crossed the entire South Indian Ocean and travelled more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles) to make landfall in Madagascar and Mozambique in late February.\n\nIt then looped back and hit the coast of Mozambique again two weeks later, before moving inland to Malawi.\n\n\"No other tropical cyclones observed in this part of the world have taken such a path across the Indian Ocean in the past two decades,\" said the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in an article.\n\nOnly four storms have crossed the southern Indian Ocean from east to west, with the last one in 2000, it said.",

                    "body": "Freddy first developed on Feb. 6 and made its second landfall on the coast of Mozambique on March 11, 34 days later. However, experts still have to look at several factors, such as the fact that it weakened below tropical cyclone status at some points during that time, in order to determine whether it broke the record, the World Meteorological Organization said.\n\nTropical cyclone Freddy hit the coast of southern Africa for a second time over the weekend, bringing its total death toll to more than 220 people in Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar.\n\nThe month-long storm has broken at least one record and could break two more, meteorologists say. As climate change causes warmer oceans, heat energy from the water's surface is fuelling stronger storms.\n\nBelow are some of the main reasons Freddy is noteworthy. HIGHEST CYCLONE ENERGY\n\nFreddy holds the record for most accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), a measure based on a storm's wind strength over its lifetime, of any storm in the southern hemisphere and possibly worldwide. Freddy has generated about as much accumulated cyclone energy as an average full North Atlantic hurricane season, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nBy last week it was in second place for the most accumulated cyclone energy of any storm since 1980, with the record held by Hurricane and Typhoon Ioke in 2006. Some estimates show that Freddy has since broken that record, with 86 ACE compared to Ioke's 85 ACE.\n\nRECORD LENGTH Freddy may have broken the record for longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nThe current record is held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994. Freddy first developed on Feb. 6 and made its second landfall on the coast of Mozambique on March 11, 34 days later.\n\nHowever, experts still have to look at several factors, such as the fact that it weakened below tropical cyclone status at some points during that time, in order to determine whether it broke the record, the World Meteorological Organization said. MOST CYCLES OF INTENSIFICATION\n\nFreddy appears to have broken the world record for the most bouts of rapid intensification, defined as an increase in wind speed of 35 miles per hour in a period of 24 hours. Freddy had seven separate cycles of rapid intensification, according to satellite estimates, said the World Meteorological Organization. The previous record was four, which was reached by several hurricanes.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization will set up an expert committee to examine this record, as well as the others, it said. UNUSUAL PATH\n\nFreddy developed off the coast of Australia, crossed the entire South Indian Ocean and travelled more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles) to make landfall in Madagascar and Mozambique in late February. It then looped back and hit the coast of Mozambique again two weeks later, before moving inland to Malawi.\n\n\"No other tropical cyclones observed in this part of the world have taken such a path across the Indian Ocean in the past two decades,\" said the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in an article. Only four storms have crossed the southern Indian Ocean from east to west, with the last one in 2000, it said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Severe flooding and rain damaged roads and bridges, hampering relief operations.\n\nFreddy has also left a trail of destruction in Mozambique, where it made landfall over the weekend. More than 22 000 people there were seeking shelter away from their homes.\n\nThe latest death toll in Malawi is a jump from 99 reported on Monday, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs said.\n\nAs heavy rains continued to pummel the country, 584 people have been injured and 37 are still missing, it said in a statement.\n\nGrief-stricken families were seen waiting to collect the dead bodies of relatives from the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital mortuary in Blantyre.\n\nMudslides triggered by heavy rain have made it difficult to get relief to those affected, aid agencies said.\n\n\"It's a challenging operation in the sense that there's been incidents of mudslides and so people are getting stuck in those mud accumulations,\" said Estere Tsoka, emergency specialist at UN children's agency UNICEF in Malawi.\n\n\"People are trying to find a place to hang in there for some time.\"\n\nFreddy pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and causing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane before moving inland towards Malawi.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique is still becoming clear, but the overall death toll is now estimated at more than 220 in Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar since Freddy first made landfall in February.\n\nREAD | Malawian president appeals for international support amid Cyclone Freddy destruction\n\nAlcidio Benjamim, a provincial manager for humanitarian organisation ForAfrika in Mozambique, told Reuters that Sofala and Zambezia provinces were badly affected in the latest hit. He said 22 000 people or 4 000 families were seeking shelter in Zambezia province at accommodation centres as of Monday.\n\n\"We are expecting that (those) numbers will increase because there are inaccessible areas due to the floods. Some vehicles can't go through the roads,\" Benjamim said.\n\nFreddy could sweep through Zambezia province again, bringing more wind and rain. \"We will know by tomorrow morning if it's more intense or not,\" Benjamim added.",

A number of places are flooding and a number of roads and bridges are cut. Visibility is almost zero. Electricity is off and also network is a problem. It's becoming more and more dire,\" Kalemba said, adding that rescue operations have also been affected by poor weather.\n\n\"It's tough. We need to use machinery (for rescue operations) but machines cannot go to places where they were supposed to excavate because of the rains,\" Kalemba added.\n\nMalawi's Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services warned Monday that \"the threat of damaging winds and heavy flooding remains very high.\"\n\nKalemba added that an improvement in weather is expected from Wednesday. \"Possibly by tomorrow, the cyclone may have passed. We are hoping to see improvement from tomorrow but today is worse. There are heavy rains and lots of water.\"\n\nIn Mozambique, at least 10 people were killed and 13 injured in the Zambezia province, according to state broadcaster Radio Mozambique, citing the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management.\n\nThe deadly cyclone has broken records for the longest-lasting storm of its kind after making landfall in Mozambique for a second time, more than two weeks after the first.\n\nMore than 22,000 people have been displaced by the tropical storm, according to Radio Mozambique.\n\n\"It's quite likely that number will go up,\" Guy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UNICEF in Mozambique, told CNN Tuesday.\n\n\"The size or the strength of the storm was much higher than the last time ... the impact in terms of damage and the impact on people's lives has been more substantial,\" he said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

                    "title": "Hundreds dead as Cyclone Freddy continues to slam Malawi and Mozambique",
                    "body": "The Tropical Cyclone Freddy, which is devastating southern Africa in a rare second landfall, has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster-management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" Stephane Dujarric, the United Nations secretary-general's spokesperson, said at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible, so the full extent of the damage remains unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute Tuesday confirmed 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.'s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said\u202fTigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's eastern and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nAt November's global climate change conference, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah said.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy has recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record of 31 days set by Hurricane John in 1994.",

                    "body": "By Vitus-Gregory Gondwe and Wanjohi Kabukuru, Associated Press\n\nThe devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has hit southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital Blantyre.\n\nSome 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the UN secretary general's spokesperson at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province.\n\nTens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centres.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late on Wednesday afternoon, the UN's meteorological centre on the island of Reunion projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilise resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries.\n\nRelief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director.\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change.\n\nCyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February.\n\nIt also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time.\n\nFreddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nThe cyclone first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone.\n\nThe UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.",

                    "body": "Blantyre: The devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has devastated southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said on Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the UN Secretary General's spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the UN's meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nationsare strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said\u202fTigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has devastated southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said on Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the UN secretary general's spokesperson said. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute said that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centres.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late on Wednesday afternoon, the UN's meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilise resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the ocean. The cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February.\n\nThe devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has hit southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital Blantyre.\n\nSome 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\nThe most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province.\n\nTens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centres.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late on Wednesday afternoon, the UN's meteorological centre on the island of Reunion projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilise resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director.\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change.\n\nCyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nIt also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time.\n\nFreddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nThe cyclone first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone.\n\nThe UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.",

                    "body": "At least 190 people are now confirmed dead in Malawi after Tropical Storm Freddy ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month.\n\nTerrifying amounts of brown water have cascaded through neighbourhoods, sweeping away homes.\n\nMalawi's commercial hub, Blantyre, has recorded most of the deaths, 158, including 36 in a landslide.\n\nThe government has declared a state of disaster in 10 southern districts that have been hardest-hit by the storm.\n\nRescue workers are overwhelmed, and are using shovels to try to find survivors buried in mud.\n\n\"We have rivers overflowing, we have people being carried away by running waters, we have buildings collapsing,\" police spokesman Peter Kalaya told the BBC.\n\nThe government's disaster relief agency said the death toll had risen from 99 on Monday to 190, while about 584 people were injured and 37 were still missing.\n\nMore than 20,00 people have been displaced, it added.\n\nOfficials at the main referral hospital in Blantyre said they could not cope with the sheer number of bodies that they were receiving.\n\nThey appealed to bereaved families to collect the corpses for burial as the hospital's mortuary was running out of space.\n\nThe death toll is expected to rise as some areas remain cut off because of relentless rain and fierce wind.\n\nThe storm has also crippled Malawi's power supply, with most parts of the country experiencing prolonged blackouts.\n\nThe national electricity company said it was unable to get its hydro-power plant working as it had been filled with debris.\n\nDensely-populated poorer communities, living in brick and mud houses, have been hardest-hit.\n\nSome of these houses have crumbled into flood waters, while others have been entirely swept away.\n\nThe collapse of roads and bridges had hampered rescue operations, while helicopters could not be used either because of the heavy rains and strong winds.\n\nThe UN and other agencies have warned that the timing of the storm could exacerbate a cholera outbreak - one of Malawi's worst public health crises.\n\nThe government has appealed for help for the tens of thousands of people who have been left without food and shelter.\n\nFreddy is the strongest tropical cyclone on record and could also be the longest-lasting one, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nOn Sunday the storm struck Mozambique as a cyclone - for the second time in a less than a month - after battering the island nation of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, causing severe destruction.\n\nIt has been difficult to determine the extent of the damage caused in Mozambique and the number of deaths, as power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected areas.\n\nAbout 10 deaths have so far been reported.\n\nExperts says climate change is making tropical storms around the world wetter, windier and more intense.\n\nFreddy had broken records for the strength it accumulated over the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean from north-western Australia.",

                    "body": "Heavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital Blantyre.\n\nSome 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the UN secretary general's spokesperson at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province.\n\nTens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centres.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late on Wednesday afternoon, the UN's meteorological centre on the island of Reunion projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilise resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries.\n\nRelief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director.\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change.\n\nCyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February.\n\nIt also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time.\n\nFreddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nThe cyclone first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone.\n\nThe UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.",

                    "body": "Vitus-Gregory Gondwe and Wanjohi Kabukuru, Associated Press\n\nThe devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has hit southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital Blantyre.\n\nSome 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the UN secretary general's spokesperson at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province.\n\nTens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centres.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late on Wednesday afternoon, the UN's meteorological centre on the island of Reunion projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilise resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries.\n\nRelief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director.\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change.\n\nCyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February.\n\nIt also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time.\n\nFreddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nThe cyclone first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone.\n\nThe UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.",

                    "body": "Heavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General's spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.'s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nationsare strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said\u202fTigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) - The devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has devastated southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi\u00b4s disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General\u00b4s spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique\u00b4s disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.\u00b4s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nationsare strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\nAn injured man helped accrossin Blantyre, Malawi, Monday, March 13, 2023.

Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world\u00b4s richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- The devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has devastated southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General's spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.'s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nationsare strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said\u202fTigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- The devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has devastated southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 216 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\nHeavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster\" in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi's disaster management directorate.\n\n\"Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,\" said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General's spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.\n\nReports from Mozambique's disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 17 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.\n\nFreddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.'s meteorological center on the island of R\u00e9union projected.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nationsare strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.\n\n\"It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,\" said\u202fTigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director. \"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.\"\n\nIn November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.\n\n\"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" Chagutah added.\n\nCyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\n___\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion last month as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy, packing powerful winds and torrential rain, killed more than 100 people in Malawi and Mozambique on its return to Southern Africa's mainland. Freddy barrelled through Southern Africa at the weekend for the second time in a few weeks, making a comeback after it first hit in late February. Malawi bore the brunt, counting at least 99 deaths after mudslides overnight washed away houses and sleeping occupants. Another 134 people were injured while 16 are reported missing. Malawi's commercial capital Blantyre recorded 85 deaths. President of Malawi Lazarus Chakwera declared a state of disaster in the Southern region of the nation. The government has appealed for local and international aid for affected families.\n\nIn neighboring Mozambique, at least 10 people died and 14 were wounded. The Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management said, the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\nAccording to the UN's World Meteorological Organization, Freddy, which formed off northwestern Australia in the first week of February, was set to become what is believed to be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record. It crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from the 21st of February before reaching Mozambique on the 24th of last month.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a rare loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique. The UN said, more than 11,000 people were affected by the storm. The last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\nREAD MORE: Cyclone Freddy claims more lives as it slams Malawi, Mozambique\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nREAD MORE: Cyclone Freddy returns to strike Mozambique for second time since late February\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

Amos Gumulira/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCharles Kalemba, a commissioner for the Department of Disaster Management Affairs agency, told CNN Tuesday that the situation had worsened in southern Malawi.\n\n\"It's worse today. A number of places are flooding and a number of roads and bridges are cut. Visibility is almost zero. Electricity is off and also network is a problem. It's becoming more and more dire,\" Kalemba said, adding that rescue operations have also been affected by poor weather.\n\n\"It's tough. We need to use machinery (for rescue operations) but machines cannot go to places where they were supposed to excavate because of the rains,\" Kalemba added.\n\nMalawi's Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services warned Monday that \"the threat of damaging winds and heavy flooding remains very high.\"\n\nKalemba added that an improvement in weather is expected from Wednesday. \"Possibly by tomorrow, the cyclone may have passed. We are hoping to see improvement from tomorrow but today is worse. There are heavy rains and lots of water.\"\n\nThe damaged roof of a school lies in the playground in Vilanculos, Mozambique, on February 24. AP\n\nIn Mozambique, at least 10 people were killed and 13 injured in the Zambezia province, according to state broadcaster Radio Mozambique, citing the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management.\n\nThe deadly cyclone has broken records for the longest-lasting storm of its kind after making landfall in Mozambique for a second time, more than two weeks after the first.\n\nMore than 22,000 people have been displaced by the tropical storm, according to Radio Mozambique.\n\n\"It's quite likely that number will go up,\" Guy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UNICEF in Mozambique, told CNN Tuesday.\n\n\"The size or the strength of the storm was much higher than the last time ... the impact in terms of damage and the impact on people's lives has been more substantial,\" he said.",

                    "body": "People look at a collapsed road caused by flooding due to heavy rains following Cyclone Freddy in Blantyre, Malawi, on March 13\n\nMalawi has diverted flights and suspended schools in its southern districts due to Cyclone Freddy, which has killed at least 40 people, according to the country's disaster management agency.\n\nCyclone Freddy hit Malawi on Friday and has caused damage in at least 10 districts in the country's south. The government in Lilongwe suspended schools in southern Malawi until further notice. In Blantyre, authorities suspended flights at the Chileka International airport for much of Sunday and Monday.\n\n\"Our officers have been deployed to rescue and provide other services to people who need rescue and we are in each of the districts because we also have police stations in these districts,\" said Peter Kalaya, spokesman for Malawi's Police Service. \"But suffice to say our efforts are being hampered by the effects of the rains because the rains are still falling.\"\n\nKalaya said the death toll will likely rise, as they expect reports from nine other affected districts. Chipiliro Khamula, spokesman for Malawi's Department of Disaster Preparedness, told VOA Monday rescue efforts were underway by police, the military and the Malawi Red Cross.\n\n\"We have also set up a national emergency operations center in Limbe to facilitate coordination of preparedness interventions,\" Khamula said. \"Again we have also stockpiled some relief items at the humanitarian staging area in Bangula, at our Blantyre warehouse, and in some districts for effective and efficient provision of relief items in affected areas.\"\n\nYobu Kachiwanda, spokesperson for Malawi's Meteorological Department, said the cyclone has started to weaken and is expected to leave Malawi soon.\n\n\"Projection is that it is still there in the next 24 to 48 hours, and will go back into Mozambique Channel as usual towards mid-week into the weekend,\" Kachiwanda said.\n\nCyclone Freddy first appeared more than a month ago and is believed to be the longest-lasting storm in the region for the past 20 years. Since February, the cyclone has left scores of people dead across Madagascar and twice-hit Mozambique.\n\nThe storm is also expected to hit parts of Zambia and Zimbabwe this week.\n\nRelated Stories",

The Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management said, the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\nAccording to the UN's World Meteorological Organization, Freddy, which formed off northwestern Australia in the first week of February, was set to become what is believed to be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record. It crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from the 21st of February before reaching Mozambique on the 24th of last month.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a rare loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique. The UN said, more than 11,000 people were affected by the storm. The last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

                    "body": "584 people injured, 37 missing as rain continues; storm has had more energy than entire U.S. hurricane season\n\nThe death toll in Malawi from tropical storm Freddy has jumped to 190 from the 99 reported previously, the country's disaster management agency said on Tuesday.\n\nFreddy, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and potentially the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, has killed scores of people and left a trail of destruction in Malawi and Mozambique.\n\nAs heavy rains continued to pummel Malawi on Tuesday, 584 people have been injured and 37 are still reported missing, the country's Department of Disaster Management Affairs said in a statement.\n\nIt's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion as it traversed the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone, which formed in the first week of February, has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record of 31 days set by Hurricane John in 1994.",

Activate your Online Access Now\n\nThe death toll in Malawi has jumped to 190 from 99 reported on Monday, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs said.\n\nAs heavy rains continued to pummel the country, 584 people have been injured and 37 are still missing, it said in a statement.\n\nFamilies in Blantyre were counting the cost of the storm as they waited to collect the dead bodies of relatives from the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital mortuary.\n\nThe flooding and rains have hit rescue operations and made it difficult to get relief to those affected, aid agencies said.\n\n\"It's a challenging operation in the sense that there's been incidents of mudslides and so people are getting stuck in those mud accumulations,\" said Estere Tsoka, emergency specialist at U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Malawi.\n\n\"People are trying to find a place to hang in there for some time.\"\n\nFreddy pummeled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique is not yet clear.

It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone - which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February - made landfall in mainland Africa.\n\nIt also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean.\n\nIt's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring centre in Reunion warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks.\n\nThe cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected to weaken and exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to Meteo-France.",

                    "body": "The death toll from the impact of Cyclone Freddy in Malawi has risen to 190.\n\nYesterday, the death toll was 99 but Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) says the number has now almost doubled.\n\nDirector responsible for recovery and resilience Peter Chimangeni has told the local media that 158 of the deaths are from Blantyre, Malawi's commercial hub.\n\nOver 584 people have been injured, 37 are missing and over 5000 have been displaced.\n\nGovernment has since set up 57 camps for people who have been displace.\n\nMeanwhile, Director for Climate Change and Meteorological Services Lucy Mtilatila has said that Cyclone Freddy has weakened and will die down by tomorrow.\n\nSpeaking to the local media, Mtilatila said the cyclone is currently in depression that is why the country is receiving rainfall today and tomorrow.\n\n\"Most of the models are showing that it is going to die down this time around. The chances of it intensifying are very slim as the conditions are not conducive,\" she said.\n\nCyclone Freddy struck central Mozambique in Zambezia on 11 March before hitting Malawi on Sunday.\n\nFreddy is arguably the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, having first made landfall in mid-February before afflicting Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique.",

Here are five points on the cyclone:\n\nCyclone Freddy killed at least 99 people after mudslides washed away houses and sleeping residents overnight in Malawi on Sunday as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month, according to Charles Kalemba, the Commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs. Another 134 people were hurt and 16 are still missing. Blantyre, the country's commercial capital, recorded 85 deaths, Mr Kalemba added. At least 10 people were killed and 14 were injured in neighbouring Mozambique.\n\nIt also ripped roofs off buildings and caused widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane before moving inland and causing landslides in Malawi.\n\nMalawi's government has also declared a \"state of disaster\" in the southern region of the country.\n\nThe cyclone had killed over 100 people and injured dozens in late February.\n\nFreddy, which developed off the coast of western Australia in the first week of February, was expected to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone ever, according to the World Meteorological Organization, UN. It swept through Madagascar beginning on February 21 and the entire southern Indian Ocean until making landfall in Mozambique on February 24.\n\nPost a comment",

Our thoughts go out to all the affected people.\n\nThe Southern African Development Community and the international community must mobilize the necessary resources to aid rescue efforts in the countries hardest hit by Cyclone Freddy\n\n\"The Southern African Development Community and the international community must mobilize the necessary resources to aid rescue efforts in the countries hardest hit by Cyclone Freddy. The focus must be on saving lives and providing relief in a manner that is compliant with human rights standards, for those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone. Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations.\"\n\nBackground\n\nCyclone Freddy struck central Mozambique in Zambezia on 11 March, destroying homes and causing widespread flooding. The storm also brought down telephone lines and power cables, leading to communication outages.\n\nAfter hitting Mozambique, the cyclone then lashed Malawi with heavy rains, bringing landslides to rural areas and impacting Blantyre with serious flooding.\n\nFreddy is arguably the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, having first made landfall in mid-February before afflicting Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique.",

Our thoughts go out to all the affected people.\n\n\"The Southern African Development Community and the international community must mobilise the necessary resources to aid rescue efforts in the countries hardest hit by Cyclone Freddy.\n\n\"The focus must be on saving lives and providing relief in a manner that is compliant with human rights standards.\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone. Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations.\"\n\nLandslides, flooding and power outages\n\nCyclone Freddy, which strengthened into one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, struck central Mozambique on 11 March - destroying homes and causing widespread flooding. The storm also brought down telephone lines and power cables, leading to communication outages.\n\nAfter hitting Mozambique, the cyclone then lashed Malawi with heavy rains, bringing landslides to rural areas and impacting Blantyre with serious flooding. Freddy is one of the longest-lasting tropical cyclones on record, having first made landfall in mid-February before moving on to cause widespread damage in Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique.",

Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations,\" said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International's Interim Director for East and Southern Africa:\n\nAmnesty has also urged the Southern African Development Community and the international community to mobilize the necessary resources to aid rescue efforts in the countries hardest hit by Cyclone Freddy.\n\nAccording to the organization, the focus must be on saving lives and providing relief in a manner that is compliant with human rights standards, for those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.\n\nCyclone Freddy struck central Mozambique in Zambezia on 11 March, destroying homes and causing widespread flooding. The storm also brought down telephone lines and power cables, leading to communication outages.\n\nAfter hitting Mozambique, the cyclone then lashed Malawi with heavy rains, bringing landslides to rural areas and impacting Blantyre with serious flooding.\n\nIn Malawi, Cyclone Freddy has killed over 100 people and has displaced over 5000 people. The storm has also destroyed houses, crops and infrastructure such as roads, bridges and telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nFreddy is arguably the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, having first made landfall in mid-February before afflicting Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique.",

The unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed more than 50 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night,\n\nBLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "Survivors of Cyclone Freddy clung to dwindling hopes of finding missing relatives on Tuesday after the storm slammed into Malawi for its second strike on Africa in a record-setting rampage.\n\nNinety-nine people have died in the impoverished country since Freddy smashed into southern Africa at the weekend, just weeks after it made a deady hit in late February, according to a provisional toll.\n\nMany have died in mudslides that have washed away makeshift homes in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre.\n\nDespair settled on Chilobwe, a township on the city's outskirts that accounts for around half of the victims.\n\nDrenched in rains that have been falling for days, survivors milled about in disbelief, looking at flattened houses and structures.\n\nMany believed there were still people trapped underneath the muddy rubble of earthen bricks -- but there were no rescuers in sight.\n\nJohn Witman, in his 80s, in a raincoat and woollen hat, with his 10 family members in tow, stood in front of what was his son-in-law's house. There were just rocks left and gushing water, for the house had been washed away.\n\n\"I wish that we could find him, and find closure. We feel helpless because no one is here to help us -- we don't know what to do,\" he told AFP.\n\nIn Chimkwankhunda, a district a few kilometres (miles) away, Steve Panganani Matera, wearing a high-visibility green jacket, pointed to a mound of mud.\n\n\"There were plenty of houses, but they are all gone,\" said Matera.\n\n\"There are plenty of bodies down there in the mud, plenty of bodies.\"\n\n- Deadly loop -\n\nCyclone Freddy reached landlocked Malawi early on Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nThe storm last week broke an unofficial benchmark as the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said on Friday.\n\nThe confirmed record belongs to a 31-day storm in 1994 named John.\n\nFreddy brewed off weeks ago off the north Australian coast, becoming a named storm on February 6.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and made landfall in Madagascar on February 21, traversing the island before reaching Mozambique on February 24 , claiming nearly two dozen lives in both countries and affecting nearly 400,000 people.\n\nIt then returned to the Indian Ocean, refuelled on the warmth of its waters, and came back much more powerful at the weekend.\n\nMeteorologists say that cyclones that track across the entire Indian Ocean are very infrequent -- the last such occurrences were in 2000 -- and Freddy's loopback is even more exceptional.\n\n\"It's a very rare thing that these cyclones feed themselves over and over again,\" said climate change expert and professor Coleen Vogel at South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand.\n\n\"People aren't expecting them to come back again once they've hit already\".\n\n\"Climate change is starting to show impacts over these systems,\" Vogel said, adding however that more research was needed to say this with greater certainty.\n\nMore than 11,000 people were affected by the storm in Malawi, according to the UN.\n\nThe cyclone has piled more woes on a country grappling with the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, which has killed over 1,600 people since last year.",

                    "body": "Malawi's commercial capital, Blantyre, received a direct hit from torrential rain and storm-force winds - Copyright AFP Jim WATSON\n\nSurvivors of Cyclone Freddy clung to dwindling hopes of finding missing relatives on Tuesday after the storm slammed into Malawi for its second strike on Africa in a record-setting rampage.\n\nNinety-nine people have died in the impoverished country since Freddy smashed into southern Africa at the weekend, just weeks after it made a deady hit in late February, according to a provisional toll.\n\nMany have died in mudslides that have washed away makeshift homes in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre.\n\nDespair settled on Chilobwe, a township on the city's outskirts that accounts for around half of the victims.\n\nDrenched in rains that have been falling for days, survivors milled about in disbelief, looking at flattened houses and structures.\n\nMany believed there were still people trapped underneath the muddy rubble of earthen bricks -- but there were no rescuers in sight.\n\nJohn Witman, in his 80s, in a raincoat and woollen hat, with his 10 family members in tow, stood in front of what was his son-in-law's house. There were just rocks left and gushing water, for the house had been washed away.\n\n\"I wish that we could find him, and find closure. We feel helpless because no one is here to help us -- we don't know what to do,\" he told AFP.\n\nIn Chimkwankhunda, a district a few kilometres (miles) away, Steve Panganani Matera, wearing a high-visibility green jacket, pointed to a mound of mud.\n\n\"There were plenty of houses, but they are all gone,\" said Matera.\n\n\"There are plenty of bodies down there in the mud, plenty of bodies.\"\n\n- Deadly loop -\n\nCyclone Freddy reached landlocked Malawi early on Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nThe storm last week broke an unofficial benchmark as the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said on Friday.\n\nThe confirmed record belongs to a 31-day storm in 1994 named John.\n\nFreddy brewed off weeks ago off the north Australian coast, becoming a named storm on February 6.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and made landfall in Madagascar on February 21, traversing the island before reaching Mozambique on February 24 , claiming nearly two dozen lives in both countries and affecting nearly 400,000 people.\n\nIt then returned to the Indian Ocean, refuelled on the warmth of its waters, and came back much more powerful at the weekend.\n\nMeteorologists say that cyclones that track across the entire Indian Ocean are very infrequent -- the last such occurrences were in 2000 -- and Freddy's loopback is even more exceptional.\n\n\"It's a very rare thing that these cyclones feed themselves over and over again,\" said climate change expert and professor Coleen Vogel at South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand.\n\n\"People aren't expecting them to come back again once they've hit already\".\n\n\"Climate change is starting to show impacts over these systems,\" Vogel said, adding however that more research was needed to say this with greater certainty.\n\nMore than 11,000 people were affected by the storm in Malawi, according to the UN.\n\nThe cyclone has piled more woes on a country grappling with the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, which has killed over 1,600 people since last year.",

                    "body": "A long-lasting cyclone that is refusing to dissipate has torn through Malawi and Mozambique killing at least 56 people and leaving many others injured or missing.\n\nAt least 51 have died in Malawi and five have been confirmed dead in Mozambique.\n\nAuthorities in Malawi say they expect the death toll to rise.\n\nCyclone Freddy hit Africa for the second time in a month on Saturday night causing widespread devastation.\n\nIt has broken records for the number of times it has re-intensified after weakening - seven times.\n\nIt is also set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone, and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated energy for a storm - that is how much energy a cyclone has released over a certain time.\n\nSo far, it has recorded more energy over its lifetime than a whole typical US hurricane season.\n\nAnd the cyclone hasn't subsided yet, according to French weather agency Meteo-France's regional centre, which warned \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\".\n\nOn Saturday, Freddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Zambezia province, Mozambique, where there were reports of damage to houses and farmlands.\n\nOne family in Malawi died after torrid winds and rain destroyed their house, according to authorities.\n\nAmong the victims is a three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" with her parents reported missing, authorities said.\n\nOn the toll of casualties and missing people, Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya said: \"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas.\"",

Our thoughts go out to all the affected people.\n\n\"The Southern African Development Community and the international community must mobilize the necessary resources to aid rescue efforts in the countries hardest hit by Cyclone Freddy. The focus must be on saving lives and providing relief in a manner that is compliant with human rights standards, for those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone. Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations.\"\n\nBackground\n\nCyclone Freddy struck central Mozambique in Zambezia on 11 March, destroying homes and causing widespread flooding. The storm also brought down telephone lines and power cables, leading to communication outages.\n\nAfter hitting Mozambique, the cyclone then lashed Malawi with heavy rains, bringing landslides to rural areas and impacting Blantyre with serious flooding.\n\nFreddy is arguably the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, having first made landfall in mid-February before afflicting Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique.",

Malawi's commercial capital Blantyre recorded 85 deaths.\n\n\"We expect the number to rise,\" Charles Kalemba, a commissioner at the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, told a press conference.\n\nAnother 134 people were injured and 16 are reported missing.\n\nResidents used their bare hands to dig through the mud hoping to find survivors.\n\n\"The people are overwhelmed. The situation is very difficult,\" said ambulance driver Honest Chirwa, adding rescuers lacked adequate equipment.\n\nMore than 11,000 people were affected by the storm, said the United Nations.\n\nThe impact of the cyclone has piled more woes on a country grappling with the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, which has killed over 1,600 people since last year.\n\n\"Severe weather events such as these are likely to exacerbate the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera,\" the UN children's agency UNICEF warned.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera, currently in Doha attending a Least Developed Countries meeting, declared a \"state of disaster in the Southern region\" of the nation.\n\nThe government was responding to the crisis while appealing for local and international aid for affected families, his office said.\n\nMalawi has ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to keep battering the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\nThe country's energy utility also warned that electricity generation would be unstable, as it would have to temporarily shut down hydropower stations to prevent muddy water from damaging turbines.\n\nCyclone Freddy reached landlocked Malawi early on Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend, killing at least 10 and injuring a further 14.\n\nThe Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) said the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\nAccording to the UN's World Meteorological Organization, Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week of February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from 21 February before reaching Mozambique on 24 February.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 136 people -- 99 in Malawi, 20 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nThe last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

Our thoughts go out to all the affected people.\n\n\"The Southern African Development Community and the international community must mobilize the necessary resources to aid rescue efforts in the countries hardest hit by Cyclone Freddy. The focus must be on saving lives and providing relief in a manner that is compliant with human rights standards, for those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone. Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations.\"\n\nBackground\n\nCyclone Freddy struck central Mozambique in Zambezia on 11 March, destroying homes and causing widespread flooding. The storm also brought down telephone lines and power cables, leading to communication outages.\n\nAfter hitting Mozambique, the cyclone then lashed Malawi with heavy rains, bringing landslides to rural areas and impacting Blantyre with serious flooding.\n\nFreddy is arguably the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, having first made landfall in mid-February before afflicting Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique.",

                    "body": "Blantyre, Malawi -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that's battering southern Africa has killed more than 100 people after striking the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in hard-hit Malawi and Mozambique countries have confirmed. The Red Cross on Monday put the overall death toll from the weeks-long storm at almost 100, with several deaths also reported on the island of Madagascar.\n\nCBS News' Sarah Carter said a state of disaster was declared in Malawi, where authorities said Tuesday that at least 99 people had been confirmed dead as a result of the cyclone since it first struck. Police spokesman Peter Kalaya said rescue teams were completely overwhelmed and residents in affected areas were forced to dig through the mud with their bare hands to find survivors.\n\nAt least 85 people were confirmed dead in Blantyre, Malawi's largest commercial city, and schools across the country were to remain closed at least until Wednesday. The deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Kalaya said.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\nAmnesty International called on Tuesday for international support for the hardest-hit African nations - for both immediate relief and, in the longer-term, as compensation for the damage done by a changing climate in nations with some of the lowest carbon footprints on the planet.\n\n\"The Southern African Development Community and the international community must mobilize the necessary resources to aid rescue efforts in the countries hardest hit by Cyclone Freddy,\" the U.K.-based human rights organization said in a statement, adding that \"the focus must be on saving lives and providing relief in a manner that is compliant with human rights standards, for those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.\"\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone,\" said Amnesty. \"Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations.\"",

                    "body": "Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for international assistance as the country deals with the deadly impact of Cyclone Freddy amid an already devastating cholera outbreak.\n\nAccording to reports on Tuesday morning, the Cyclone Freddy death toll in Mozambique and Malawi has surpassed 100. Sixteen people are still missing.\n\nIn a statement issued late on Monday, Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster in the southern parts of Malawi\" in terms of the country's Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act.\n\nWATCH | Cyclone Freddy returns, killing more than 100 in Malawi and Mozambique\n\nHe said the government was already on the ground, responding to emergencies.\n\nHowever, more help is needed from aid agencies and global partners.\n\n\"[The government] is appealing for local and international support for all the families affected by this disaster,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), aid agencies anticipated the destruction caused by Cyclone Freddy.\n\nThe agency said:\n\nIn a statement, Malawi's Ministry of Natural Resources and Climate Change said strong winds would cause torrential rains which could, within 48 hours, cause 300mm to 400mm of rain.\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, heavy rains start at 96mm per 24 hours.\n\nThe ministry added that the threat of damaging winds and heavy flooding remained high, but that there was hope the situation would improve from Wednesday.\n\nThe public was advised to move to higher ground to stay clear of mudslides.\n\nMalawi is one of the recipients of Scotland's climate fund. About 25% of the R43.2 million was allocated to the country.\n\nThe Scottish government's funding is being used in Malawi's Zomba district to repair portions of a 7km flood embankment on the Phalombe River that was broken during storms in 10 locations last year.\n\nAnother disbursement in April will come in handy for Malawi.\n\nMozambique\n\nWorld Bank Vice-President for Eastern and Southern Africa, Victoria Kwakwa, met Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi on Friday, and sources told News24 that part of their engagement centred on climate resilience.\n\nThe impact of the cyclone in Mozambique was greater than the impact in Malawi. Its initial landfall was in the coastal country more than a week ago.\n\nOn Sunday, the National Disaster Management Institute (INGD) announced the compulsory evacuation of people in Sofala, Manica, and Zambezia provinces, which are flood-prone areas.\n\nThe Emergency Operational Committee (Cenoe) estimated that there would be 200mm of rainfall per day until the cyclone dies down around Thursday.\n\nThe media in Mozambique reported that schools were closed in areas such as Tete province in anticipation of the deadly impact of the cyclone.\n\nThe destruction cut off communication with Quelimane, the capital of Zambezia province, and commerce was affected.\n\nThe National Maritime Institute (Inamar) said in a statement that it had banned shipping activities in Sofala, Zambezia, and Nampula.\n\nThe Beira port serves as the main port for Zimbabwe and Malawi. South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Zambia also use it.",

                    "body": "* Tropical Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique on 11 March and then moved inland towards southern Malawi.\n\n* The President of Malawi has declared a State of Disaster in the Southern Region of the country, where over 100 people have reportedly died.\n\n* Heavy rains are expected in the coming days in both Mozambique and Malawi, heightening the risk of further floods and landslides.\n\n* Humanitarian partners are supporting the Government-led responses to Tropical Cyclone Freddy in Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nTropical Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique in Quelimane District, Zambezia Province, on 11 March.\n\nThe Freddy weather system has continued to move over land as a tropical depression, with a localized centre close to the border between Mozambique and the southern tip of Malawi, according to Meteo France. Although the system has weakened considerably, it is still generating intense rainfall in the interior of Mozambique and southern Malawi, with extreme rainfall forecasted for the days ahead across Zambezia, Sofala and Tete provinces in Mozambique and southern Malawi, according to the latest Flood Risk Bulletin produced for and with support of the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Mozambique, Freddy has brought strong winds to Zambezia province, as well as heavy rains (above 200mm/24h) to Zambezia, Sofala, Manica, Tete and Niassa provinces. Some of these provinces received as much rain in 24 hours as they would usually experience in one month. In Zambezia province alone, over 22,000 people have sought refuge in temporary accommodation centres, 10 people have died and 14 have been injured. About 1,900 houses have been damaged (1,050) or destroyed (832), according to preliminary data from the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD), and these figures are expected to rise ahead as further information becomes available. Basic services and public infrastructure have also been affected.\n\nFollowing Freddy 's first landfall in Inhambane province on 24 February, about 171,400 people were affected -- including 10 killed, 10 injured and 5,100 displaced -- by heavy rains and floods. More than 30,000 houses were affected, according to INGD as of 6 March.\n\nFreddy's landfall came on the back of floods in Mozambique that had already impacted more 43,000 people since 3 February, particularly in Maputo. Meanwhile, the cholera outbreak in Mozambique continues to spread, and the number of confirmed cholera cases has risen to nearly 8,500 as of 12 March.\n\nIn Malawi, the President has declared a State of Disaster in the Southern Region, particularly Blantyre City and District, Chikwawa District, Chiradzulu District, Mulanje District, Mwanza District, Neno District, Nsanje District, Phalombe District, Thyolo District, and Zomba City and District. At least 111 people have lost their lives, and at least 16 are reportedly missing following heavy rains and strong winds attributed to the Freddy weather system since 12 March, according to Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA). Eighty-five of those killed died due to mudslides in Cilobwe township in Blantyre district. Some 19,000 people (4,000 households) have been displaced in the hardest-hit districts (Nsanje (approximately 5,850 people), Chikwawa (5,004), Mulanje (3,659), Thyolo (2,390) Blantyre City and District (1,647), Chiradzulu (765)), while data is not yet available for Mwanza, Neno and Phalombe. Water levels in areas surrounding the Shire River have started to rise and Thuchila River is also at risk of flooding. Rainfall accumulation over southern Malawi could reach 400mm to 500mm over the space of 72 hours. The Ministry of Education temporarily suspended classes in the 10 at-risk districts on 13 and 14 March.\n\nIn Madagascar, at least 17 people have now died due to Tropical Cyclone Freddy (7 from the first landfall on 21 February and 10 from the latest rains on 5 and 6 March), three are missing and nearly 299,000 people have affected (226,000 in the south east, and over 72,600 in the south-west). Following Freddy's pass-by the south-west of the country on 5 and 6 March, localized floods are visible in Morombe city and its three surrounding municipalities, as well as Toliara city, where schools and other administrative buildings are still flooded, according to the findings of an aerial assessment. However, the impact of the storm was less than expected and there is almost no visible wind damage in the villages along the western coast between Morombe and Toliara and less than 5 per cent damage has been reported in the agricultural sector following rapid removal of water on crop fields and rice fields.",

                    "body": "Tropical Storm Freddy killed more than 130 people in South Africa in a month. The storm made landfall for the second time this past weekend and wreaked havoc again.\n\nIt is difficult to give exact figures on the damage and the number of victims, because the electric current and telephone lines are damaged in many places. At least 99 people have been killed in Malawi, including 85 in the town of Blantyre, according to the government. The total death toll from the storm in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar is believed to be around 136.\n\nDoctors Without Borders told Reuters news agency that at least 60 deaths had been transferred to Blantyre Hospital in Malawi since noon yesterday. About 200 wounded people will also be treated in the hospital.\n\nThey were hit by fallen trees, or they were hit by landslides and floods.\n\nTropical Storm Freddy made landfall on the African continent for the second time this past weekend, in Mozambique. There, the storm caused, among other things, flooding in towns along the coast.\n\nIn Mozambique, it has rained more in the past four weeks than the average for a year. Freddy then moved inland towards Malawi, with continuing torrential rains causing landslides.\n\nThe first time Freddy came to the beach was at the end of last month. Then 27 people died in Mozambique and the neighboring state of Madagascar. The storm then turned back towards the sea and was reactivated by warm sea water.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere. The United Nations World Meteorological Organization says it is likely to be the longest-running tropical storm on record. Freddy has been going on for over 30 days. The previous record was a 31-day storm in 1994.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that Freddy may cause heavy rains and floods in the area until tomorrow. Malawi is still recovering from previous tropical storms, Anna and Gombe, which hit the country just over a year ago. The consequences are also significant in Mozambique. According to the United Nations, there are nearly half a million people in need of assistance.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, the region is also facing a \"very worrying\" outbreak of cholera. The cause of this outbreak is poor water and sanitation, ongoing conflicts, and a weak healthcare system. Severe weather conditions exacerbated the situation.",

Our thoughts go out to all the affected people.\n\n\"The Southern African Development Community and the international community must mobilize the necessary resources to aid rescue efforts in the countries hardest hit by Cyclone Freddy. The focus must be on saving lives and providing relief in a manner that is compliant with human rights standards, for those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.\n\n\"The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone. Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world's richest nations.\"\n\nBackground\n\nCyclone Freddy struck central Mozambique in Zambezia on 11 March, destroying homes and causing widespread flooding. The storm also brought down telephone lines and power cables, leading to communication outages.\n\nAfter hitting Mozambique, the cyclone then lashed Malawi with heavy rains, bringing landslides to rural areas and impacting Blantyre with serious flooding.\n\nFreddy is arguably the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, having first made landfall in mid-February before afflicting Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique.\n\nFor more information or to arrange an interview, please contact Amnesty International's press office on:\n\nTel: +44 20 7413 5566\n\nEmail: press@amnesty.org\n\nTwitter: @amnestypress",

                    "body": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nA long-lasting cyclone that is refusing to dissipate has torn through Malawi and Mozambique killing at least 56 people and leaving many others injured or missing.\n\nAt least 51 have died in Malawi and five have been confirmed dead in Mozambique.\n\nAuthorities in Malawi say they expect the death toll to rise.\n\nCyclone Freddy hit Africa for the second time in a month on Saturday night causing widespread devastation.\n\nIt has broken records for the number of times it has re-intensified after weakening - seven times.\n\nIt is also set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone, and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated energy for a storm - that is how much energy a cyclone has released over a certain time.\n\nSo far, it has recorded more energy over its lifetime than a whole typical US hurricane season.\n\nAnd the cyclone hasn't subsided yet, according to French weather agency Meteo-France's regional centre, which warned \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\".\n\nOn Saturday, Freddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Zambezia province, Mozambique, where there were reports of damage to houses and farmlands.\n\nOne family in Malawi died after torrid winds and rain destroyed their house, according to authorities.\n\nAmong the victims is a three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" with her parents reported missing, authorities said.\n\nOn the toll of casualties and missing people, Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya said: \"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas.\"\n\nOver the last month, the storm travelled from near Australia across the entire southern Indian Ocean, hitting Madagascar and Reunion on its path.\n\nThe UN's weather agency will determine if Freddy has broken the record for the longest tropical cyclone set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nMeteo-France also said that Freddy should subside and exit back to the sea on Wednesday.\n\nExperts say that while fossil-fuel driven climate change has not increased the number of tropical cyclones overall, it has increased the number of intense and destructive storms in three key ways.\n\nA warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, increasing the extreme rainfall dumped by storms. Hotter oceans also fuel more powerful storms, spreading tropical storms further north and south. Higher sea levels also inflict more damage during a storm surge.",

                    "body": "Tropical Cyclone Freddy has killed at least 99 people since it made landfall in southern Malawi on Sunday, after battering Madagascar and Mozambique in recent weeks, Malawian authorities confirmed. Between the three countries, up to 136 deaths have already been recorded since the impact in the southeast of the continent at the end of February.\n\nAt a press conference in Blantyre (south), the commercial capital and second city in the country, the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, Charles Kalemba, confirmed that number, of which 85 deaths were registered in that city. In addition, only in Blantyre 134 seriously injured have been recorded, Kalemba said, quoted by local media.\n\nAccording to the commissioner, some 4,000 homes have been affected, which is equivalent to more than 10,000 people. These data are higher than those previously provided by the country's Red Cross. The institution is carrying out \"search and rescue, first aid and hospital evacuation\" tasks.\n\nMalawi President Lazarus Chakwera, who is traveling abroad but will return to the country on Tuesday, declared a \"state of disaster\" in the Southern Region given the \"devastation\" Freddy has caused in the area. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Climate Change warned that the cyclone \"will continue to cause torrential rains associated with gusty and strong winds\" in areas of southern Malawi.\n\nScheduled flights at the airport in Blantyre, the country's commercial capital and second-biggest city, were canceled and schools closed after flooding from overflowing rivers hit residential areas, leaving roads blocked and houses washed away.\n\nAccording to the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, the cyclone could drop accumulated rainfall of between 400 and 500 millimeters in the south of the country within 72 hours, before losing strength on Wednesday. In addition to Blantyre, flooding is expected in Nsanje, Chikwawa, Thyolo, Mwanza, Mulanje, Phalombe and Zomba districts.\n\nFreddy is already one of the longest lasting cyclones and has had the longest trajectory in recent decades, covering more than 10,000 kilometers since it formed in northern Australia on February 4 and crossed the entire Indian Ocean to southern africa.\n\nThe cyclone made its first impact on the eastern coast of Madagascar on February 21, where nearly 300,000 people have been affected and a total of 17 have died after Freddy returned to the island on Sunday, March 5. the United Nations estimated.\n\nOn February 24, the cyclone reached Mozambique, where ten people died, to which another died when he returned to the country at the end of last week, according to international media reports. Likewise, more than 170,000 people in southern and central Mozambique were affected by its passage.\n\nAs reported by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy could have broken the record for the duration of Hurricane-Typhoon John, which lasted 31 days in 1994, although the organization's experts will not confirm this record until the cyclone has dissipated.\n\nThe spokesperson for this UN agency, Clare Nullis, assured last Friday that, although the impact of the cyclone in Madagascar and Mozambique has been \"considerable\", the number of deaths it has left has been limited by the accuracy of the predictions. early weather.",

Much of the damage is found in areas battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and burst river banks triggered by the cyclone. Local police said 63 people in Malawi have died, with 134 people injured and are admitted in hospital. Meanwhile, authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed since Saturday when the cyclone made its second landfall on the country's coast. In the seaport of Quelimane, where the cyclone lashed over, house roofs were blown off while others were demolished. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected areas, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.",

Schools have been suspended in the East African nation, also grappling with its worst cholera outbreak.\n\nAt least 136 deaths have been recorded since the storm first landed in February, causing causalities in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi.",

Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.",

                    "body": "The Disaster Service reported on Monday that about 100 people have perished in Malawi's southern districts as a result of floods brought on by Freddy.\n\nStorm Freddy struck southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend leaving a trail of destruction and more than 100 fatalities as reported by Voice of America (VoA). Mozambique and Malawi were assessing the damage caused by the cyclone. The country's disaster service reported on Monday that about 100 people have perished in Malawi's southern districts as a result of floods brought on by Storm Freddy, that made a rare return to the area with torrential rains.\n\n\"The death toll, including in other districts that have been hit in the southern region, has risen to 99... but we expect the number to rise,\" Charles Kalemba, commissioner at the Department of Disaster Management Affairs stated. More than 10,000 people have been impacted by the storm, according to Kalemba, and 85 fatalities have been reported in Blantyre's commercial centre.\n\nDoctors Without Borders (MSF) national director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by phone that the central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon and that 200 injured people were being treated there. She claimed that landslides, flash floods, and falling trees were to blame for the injuries.\n\nShe continued, \"A lot of [houses] are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\" President Lazarus Chakwera declared a state of disaster for South Malawi. The cyclone's aftermath has made matters worse for a nation already struggling with the biggest cholera outbreak in its history, which has claimed more than 1,600 lives since last year as reported by VoA.\n\n\"Severe weather events such as these are likely to exacerbate the spread of water-borne diseases like cholera,\" the U.N. children's agency UNICEF warned in a statement.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, Freddy is one of the most powerful storms to have ever been observed in the southern hemisphere and may turn out to be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone. On Saturday, it pounded central Mozambique, toppling houses and causing extensive flooding near the port of Quelimane. Later, it moved inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that triggered landslides.\n\nDue to the fact that the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some areas of the impacted area, the full amount of the damage and fatalities, particularly in Mozambique, is not yet known. Since Freddy's initial impact last month, 136 people have died in Mozambique, Malawi, and Madagascar.",

The situation is very difficult,\" said ambulance driver Honest Chirwa, adding rescuers lacked adequate equipment.\n\nMore than 11,000 people were affected by the storm, said the United Nations.",

More people are still missing.\n\nBlantyre city was badly impacted, with regional police spokeswoman Beatrice Mikuwa saying at least 36 bodies were recovered in the township of Chilobwe \"which has been hit the most\", with dozens of houses were washed away.\n\nFreddy, on track to become one of the longest-lasting storms on record, barrelled through southern Africa at the weekend for the second time within weeks, making a comeback after a first hit in late February.",

REUTERS/Eldson Chagara.\n\nAt least 40 people have been confirmed dead on Monday from tropical storm Freddy in Malawi, where numbers are still coming in from areas affected by flooding, government officials said.\n\nA residential area in Blantyre city was covered in mud water as search and rescue operations dug through rocks to find trapped bodies.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt pummeled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could worsen because of Freddy's heavy rains.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

He then travelled to South Africa where the government said he was carrying out official engagements.\n\nThe Government's Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services had been issuing warnings for several days that Malawi was at risk of being hit by Cyclone Freddy.\n\nOn Sunday night, the cyclone landed in Malawi, wreaking havoc in Blantyre, Phalombe, Thyolo, Nsanje, Zomba and Mulanje. The floods killed about 100 people and destroyed houses, roads, bridges.\n\nThe country's main power stations in the Southern Region were also shut down over the floods.\n\nOn social media, Malawians spoke of the absence of leadership and many argued that Chakwera should have cut short his trip in order to provide leadership in this time.\n\n\"And the Leader is still outside the country while Cyclone ravages Malawi,\" wrote Kondwani Munthali on Monday afternoon.\n\nWhile Journalist Brian Ligomeka wrote: \"Leadership during Cyclone Freddy The absence The Theory The practice The mockery.\"\n\nPolitician Leonard Chimbanga also bashed Chakwera for not returning home upon the emergence of the cyclone.\n\n\"When South Africa was in crisis last year their president cut short his trip to attend to the crisis.\n\n\"When Mozambique was in crisis since last week their president Nyusi cut short his trip to attend to the crisis,\" said Chimbanga.\n\nOn Monday evening, Secretary to the President and Cabinet Colleen Zamba said in a statement that Chakwera is concerned with the devastation brought by Cyclone Freddy.\n\nShe added that the president has declared a state of disaster in the Southern Region.\n\nMeanwhile, Chakwera and First Lady Monica Chakwera are expected to return home today from South Africa.",

                    "body": "The central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre said by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya said that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, the country's second-largest city, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nCRITICAL SITUATION\n\nMalawi's national electricity company EGENCO said that power generation capacity was unstable and that it had experienced total system shutdown twice on Monday. It has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.\n\nAt least ten people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UN children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, said from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

The situation is very difficult,\" said ambulance driver Honest Chirwa, adding rescuers lacked adequate equipment.\n\nMore than 11 000 people were affected by the storm, said the United Nations.\n\nThe impact of the cyclone has piled more woes on a country grappling with the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, which has killed over 1 600 people since last year.\n\n\"Severe weather events such as these are likely to exacerbate the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera,\" the UN children's agency UNICEF warned.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera, currently in Doha attending a Least Developed Countries meeting, declared a \"state of disaster in the Southern region\" of the nation.\n\nThe government was responding to the crisis while appealing for local and international aid for affected families, his office said.\n\nMalawi has ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to keep battering the nation's south.\n\nAt least 10 other people died and 14 were wounded in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said.\n\nThe Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management said the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\nThe country's energy utility also warned that electricity generation would be unstable, as it would have to temporarily shut down hydropower stations to prevent muddy water from damaging turbines.\n\nCyclone Freddy reached landlocked Malawi early on Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nAccording to the UN's World Meteorological Organisation, Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week of February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from February 21 before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 136 people - 99 in Malawi, 20 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nThe last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

He warned the number of dead and injured could rise.\n\nMalawi's government has declared a \"state of disaster\" in the southern region of the country.\n\nThe country's President, Lazarus Chakwera, \"has noted with grave concern the devastation that Cyclone Freddy is currently bringing to most districts in Malawi's Southern region,\" a government press release said.\n\n\"Accordingly, government is already responding to the emergencies, rendering urgent assistance to all affected districts, and appealing for local and international support for all the families affected by this disaster,\" the statement continued.\n\nSchools will remain shut in 10 of the worst affected districts until Wednesday, Malawi's education ministry said in a statement Sunday.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Malawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya told CNN the destruction caused by the storm had inundated roadways and triggered blackouts in the worst affected areas.\n\nKalemba said rescue efforts have been \"tough\".\n\n\"We are still having a lot of rains coming down. We are now experiencing landslides, flash floods and stones rolling down some hills. Because of the weather, rescue efforts are not easy. Some of the places we have to go and rescue people, it's not easy to get there. It's tough but we are making sure we do the job that we need to do,\" he said.\n\nThe deadly Cyclone Freddy has broken records for the longest-lasting storm of its kind and has struck neighboring Mozambique and also Madagascar, killing more than 20 people and displacing thousands of others across both countries.\n\nIt has been described as a \"very rare\" storm by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which called its journey so far \"incredible and dangerous.\"",

                    "body": "The country's energy utility also warned that electricity generation would be unstable, as it would have to temporarily shut down hydropower stations to prevent muddy water from damaging turbines\n\nCyclone Freddy, packing powerful winds and torrential rain, killed more than 100 people in Malawi and Mozambique on its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday.\n\nFreddy, on track to become the longest-lasting storm on record, barrelled through southern Africa at the weekend for the second time within a few weeks, making a comeback after a first hit in late February.\n\nMalawi bore the brunt, counting at least 99 deaths after mudslides overnight washed away houses and sleeping occupants.\n\n\"We expect the number to rise,\" Charles Kalemba, a commissioner at the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, told a press conference.\n\nAnother 134 people were injured and 16 are reported missing.\n\nMalawi's commercial capital Blantyre recorded 85 deaths.\n\nResidents used their bare hands to dig through the mud hoping to find survivors.\n\nGovernment rescuers were late to arrive, said one resident refusing to give his name, covered in mud, as he helped with the rescue effort.\n\n\"The people are overwhelmed. The situation is very difficult,\" said ambulance driver Honest Chirwa, adding rescuers lacked adequate equipment.\n\nMore than 11,000 people were affected by the storm, said the United Nations.\n\nThe impact of the cyclone has piled more woes on a country grappling with the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, which has killed over 1,600 people since last year.\n\n\"Severe weather events such as these are likely to exacerbate the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera,\" the UN children's agency UNICEF warned.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera, currently in Doha attending a Least Developed Countries meeting, declared a \"state of disaster in the Southern region\" of the nation.\n\nThe government was responding to the crisis while appealing for local and international aid for affected families, his office said.\n\nMalawi has ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to keep battering the nation's south.\n\nAt least 10 other people died and 14 were wounded in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said.\n\nThe Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management said the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\n'Rare' loop trajectory\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\nThe country's energy utility also warned that electricity generation would be unstable, as it would have to temporarily shut down hydropower stations to prevent muddy water from damaging turbines.\n\nCyclone Freddy reached landlocked Malawi early on Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nAccording to the UN's World Meteorological Organization, Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week of February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from February 21 before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 136 people -- 99 in Malawi, 20 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nThe last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

                    "body": "Lilongwe, March 14 (SocialNews.XYZ) At least 99 people have been killed in Malawi after tropical cyclone Freddy lashed the east African nation, authorities said on Tuesday, adding that a rescue mission is currently underway.\n\nConfirming the toll to reporters late Monday, Commissioner for the Department of Disaster and Management Affairs (DoDMA) Charles Kalemba said that 85 fatalities were recorded in the commercial city of Blantyre alone, reports Xinhua news agency.\n\nKalemba said Blantyre has recorded 134 serious injuries while several other injuries and loss of property have been recorded across the 10 districts that have been heavily affected by the cyclone.\n\nThe deaths were caused due to the collapse of residential houses, flash floods, and landslides in the affected districts including Blantyre where one of the mountains, Soche, broke loose releasing a huge flow of water, heavy rocks, and mud that swept a number of homes and buried residents in the process.\n\nThe cyclone has also destroyed power generation infrastructure, leaving almost the entire country in blackout since Monday morning.\n\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has declared a state of emergency in the 10 districts that have been heavily affected in the southern region.\n\nFreddy is the strongest tropical cyclone on record and could also be the long-lasting one, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nOn Sunday, it struck Mozambique as a cyclone -- for the second time in a less than a month after battering the island nation of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, causing severe destruction.\n\nIt has been difficult to determine the extent of the damage caused in Mozambique and the number of deaths as power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected areas.\n\nFreddy also broke records for the strength it has accumulated over the 8,000-km path it travelled across the Indian Ocean from north-western Australia.",

                    "body": "(Reuters) - Mozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 100 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nThe storm has killed 99 people in Malawi, including 85 in the main commercial hub of Blantyre, said the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, Charles Kalemba, at a press briefing.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now around 136.\n\nThe central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, the country's second-largest city, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.",

It has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.\n\nAt least ten people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, Reuters reported.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

The situation is very difficult,\" said ambulance driver Honest Chirwa, adding rescuers lacked adequate equipment.\n\nMore than 11,000 people were affected by the storm, said the United Nations.\n\nThe impact of the cyclone has piled more woes on a country grappling with the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, which has killed over 1,600 people since last year.\n\n\"Severe weather events such as these are likely to exacerbate the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera,\" the UN children's agency UNICEF warned.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera, currently in Doha attending a Least Developed Countries meeting, declared a \"state of disaster in the Southern region\" of the nation.\n\nThe government was responding to the crisis while appealing for local and international aid for affected families, his office said.\n\nMalawi has ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to keep battering the nation's south.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.",

                    "body": "Mozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 100 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nThe storm has killed 99 people in Malawi, including 85 in the main commercial hub of Blantyre, said the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, Charles Kalemba, at a press briefing.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now around 136.\n\nThe central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, the country's second-largest city, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nCritical situation\n\nMalawi's national electricity company EGENCO said that power generation capacity was unstable and that it had experienced total system shutdown twice on Monday. It has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.\n\nAt least ten people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

As Freddy made landfall on Sunday in central Mozambique for a second time in the space of a few weeks, lashing a stretch of southern Africa with heavy rains and winds, it also may have solidified its status as one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever observed in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThat's the growing assessment of the world's meteorological community, as my colleague Matthew Cappucci reported. Freddy emerged around Feb. 6 off the coasts of Indonesia and Western Australia, transited thousands of miles west across the Indian Ocean before striking the island of Madagascar on Feb. 19 and then making landfall in Mozambique on Feb. 24, where it flooded towns, devastated crops and plunged communities in darkness. It looped back over the Mozambique Channel and picked up energy again over its warm waters before returning to the African mainland.",

He warned the number of dead and injured could rise.\n\nMalawi's government has declared a \"state of disaster\" in the southern region of the country.\n\nThe country's President, Lazarus Chakwera, \"has noted with grave concern the devastation that Cyclone Freddy is currently bringing to most districts in Malawi's Southern region,\" a government press release said.\n\n\"Accordingly, government is already responding to the emergencies, rendering urgent assistance to all affected districts, and appealing for local and international support for all the families affected by this disaster,\" the statement continued.\n\nSchools will remain shut in 10 of the worst affected districts until Wednesday, Malawi's education ministry said in a statement Sunday.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Malawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya told CNN the destruction caused by the storm had inundated roadways and triggered blackouts in the worst affected areas.\n\nKalemba said rescue efforts have been \"tough\".\n\n\"We are still having a lot of rains coming down. We are now experiencing landslides, flash floods and stones rolling down some hills. Because of the weather, rescue efforts are not easy. Some of the places we have to go and rescue people, it's not easy to get there. It's tough but we are making sure we do the job that we need to do,\" he said.\n\nThe deadly Cyclone Freddy has broken records for the longest-lasting storm of its kind and has struck neighboring Mozambique and also Madagascar, killing more than 20 people and displacing thousands of others across both countries.\n\nIt has been described as a \"very rare\" storm by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which called its journey so far \"incredible and dangerous.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

(PHOTO / ALFREDO ZUNIGA / UNICEF / AFP)\n\nBLANTYRE, Malawi/MAPUTO - Mozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 100 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummeled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nREAD MORE: Record-breaking storm Freddy due to hit Mozambique again\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now around 136\n\nThe storm has killed 99 people in Malawi, including 85 in the main commercial hub of Blantyre, said the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, Charles Kalemba, at a press briefing.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now around 136.\n\nThe central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nALSO READ: Mozambique, Malawi reel from Storm Freddy, at least 17 dead\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, the country's second-largest city, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nA general view of a landslide at Mbayani in Blantyre, Malawi, on March 13, 2023, due to heavy rains following the effects of storm Freddy. (PHOTO / AFP)\n\nCritical situation\n\nMalawi's national electricity company EGENCO said that power generation capacity was unstable and that it had experienced total system shutdown twice on Monday. It has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.\n\nWe saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localized flooding.\n\nGuy Taylor, Chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UNICEF in Mozambique\n\nAt least ten people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.\n\nREAD MORE: Record-strength cyclone Freddy pounds Mozambique\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UN children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localized flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

(Photo by Joseph Mizere/Xinhua)\n\nBLANTYRE, Malawi, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Tropical Cyclone Freddy in Malawi reached 99 Monday evening with 85 deaths recorded in the commercial city of Blantyre alone, authorities have confirmed.\n\nCommissioner for the Department of Disaster and Management Affairs (DoDMA), Charles Kalemba, confirmed the development at a press briefing held in Blantyre Monday evening, adding that thousands have also been displaced.\n\nKalemba said Blantyre has recorded 134 serious injuries while several other injuries and loss of property have been recorded across the 10 districts that have been heavily affected by the cyclone.\n\nThe loss of lives has been due to the collapse of residential houses, flash floods, and landslides in the affected districts including Blantyre where one of the mountains, Soche, broke loose releasing a huge flow of water, heavy rocks, and mud that swept a number of homes and burried residents in the process.\n\nThe cyclone has also destroyed power generation infrastructure, leaving almost the entire country in blackout since Monday morning.\n\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has declared a state of emergency in the 10 districts that have been heavily affected in the southern region.\n\nPeople walk in the mud in Chilobwe, Blantyre, Malawi, on March 13, 2023.

                    "body": "The death toll of Tropical Storm Freddy looks to amount to 60 people by Monday as Mozambique and Malawi assess the scope of damage left in its wake, with scores of people injured.\n\nMaking for the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and potentially the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, Freddy ripped through southern Africa for the second time this month over the weekend.\n\nIt mowed down buildings in central Mozambique on Saturday, snatching roofs and unleashing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane. The tempest then moved inland towards Malawi where torrential rains brought about landslides.\n\nCounting of losses and full damage assessment continues in Mozambique where the power supply and phone signals remain cut off in some parts of the affected areas.\n\nAt least 60 bodies had been delivered to the central hospital of Malawi's main commercial hub of Blantyre by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters, adding that some 200 people were hospitalized thereat.\n\nFalling trees, landslides, and flash floods were the main causes of injuries, she said, adding that \"a lot of [houses] are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nChipiliro Khamula, a spokesperson for the department of disaster management, said that casualties were still coming in from the affected areas.\n\nFor his part, police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescuers had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the hardest-hit townships in the country's second-largest city Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents are without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya stressed.\n\nThe cyclone also bore down on Mozambique's Quelimane where at least six people died, authorities told the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nScores more people were injured, Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on Radio Mozambique.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi, and Madagascar since its first arrival last month is now nearing 100.\n\nHumanitarian agencies in Mozambique lacked the capacity to address a disaster of this size, Guy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications, and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localized flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had subsided on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had devastated crops and created risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nIn just the past four weeks, Mozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall.\n\nMeanwhile, Malawi has been struggling with the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history. U.N. agencies warn the situation could now deteriorate.\n\nThe leading factor behind tropical storms' buffed-up might could be oceans absorbing heat from greenhouse gas emissions, some scientists say, adding that when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is then transferred to the atmosphere.",

(Photo by Joseph Mizere/Xinhua)\n\nBLANTYRE, Malawi, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Tropical Cyclone Freddy in Malawi reached 99 Monday evening with 85 deaths recorded in the commercial city of Blantyre alone, authorities have confirmed.\n\nCommissioner for the Department of Disaster and Management Affairs (DoDMA), Charles Kalemba, confirmed the development at a press briefing held in Blantyre Monday evening, adding that thousands have also been displaced.\n\nKalemba said Blantyre has recorded 134 serious injuries while several other injuries and loss of property have been recorded across the 10 districts that have been heavily affected by the cyclone.\n\nThe loss of lives has been due to the collapse of residential houses, flash floods, and landslides in the affected districts including Blantyre where one of the mountains, Soche, broke loose releasing a huge flow of water, heavy rocks, and mud that swept a number of homes and burried residents in the process.\n\nThe cyclone has also destroyed power generation infrastructure, leaving almost the entire country in blackout since Monday morning.\n\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has declared a state of emergency in the 10 districts that have been heavily affected in the southern region. \u25a0\n\nPeople walk in the mud in Chilobwe, Blantyre, Malawi, on March 13, 2023.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE/MAPUTO. - Mozambique and Malawi yesterday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 100 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nIn Malawi, the commissioner for Disaster Management Affairs Charles Kalemba said yesterday they had confirmed 99 deaths in various districts of the Southern region with Blantyre alone recording 85 deaths and 134 serious injuries today\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report.\n\nA three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" said Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya.\n\nAt least 36 bodies were found in one township of Chilobwe, in Blantyre, a vast city of more than one million people, regional police spokeswoman Beatrice Mikuwa said, adding the township was \"hit the most\", with dozens of houses washed away.\n\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera declared a \"state of disaster in the Southern region\" of the country after he \"noted with grave concern the devastation that Cyclone Freddy is currently bringing\".\n\nThe government is already responding to the disaster while appealing for local and international relief aid for the affected families, it said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique's Quelimane, which was struck hard by the storm, authorities told the public broadcaster yesterday.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into yesterday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nScores more people were injured, Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on Radio Mozambique.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone.\n\nTelecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy, packing powerful winds and torrential rain, killed more than 100 people in Malawi and Mozambique on its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday.\n\nFreddy, on track to become the longest-lasting storm on record, barrelled through southern Africa at the weekend for the second time within a few weeks, making a comeback after a first hit in late February.\n\nMalawi bore the brunt, counting at least 99 deaths after mudslides overnight washed away houses and sleeping occupants.\n\n\"We expect the number to rise,\" Charles Kalemba, a commissioner at the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, told a press conference.\n\nAnother 134 people were injured and 16 are reported missing.\n\nMalawi's commercial capital Blantyre recorded 85 deaths.\n\nResidents used their bare hands to dig through the mud hoping to find survivors.\n\nGovernment rescuers were late to arrive, said one resident refusing to give his name, covered in mud, as he helped with the rescue effort.\n\n\"The people are overwhelmed. The situation is very difficult,\" said ambulance driver Honest Chirwa, adding rescuers lacked adequate equipment.\n\nMore than 11,000 people were affected by the storm, said the United Nations.\n\nThe impact of the cyclone has piled more woes on a country grappling with the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, which has killed over 1,600 people since last year.\n\n\"Severe weather events such as these are likely to exacerbate the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera,\" the UN children's agency UNICEF warned.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera, currently in Doha attending a Least Developed Countries meeting, declared a \"state of disaster in the Southern region\" of the nation.\n\nThe government was responding to the crisis while appealing for local and international aid for affected families, his office said.\n\nMalawi has ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to keep battering the nation's south.\n\nAt least 10 other people died and 14 were wounded in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said.\n\nThe Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management said the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\n- 'Rare' loop trajectory -\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\nThe country's energy utility also warned that electricity generation would be unstable, as it would have to temporarily shut down hydropower stations to prevent muddy water from damaging turbines.\n\nCyclone Freddy reached landlocked Malawi early on Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nAccording to the UN's World Meteorological Organization, Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week of February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from February 21 before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 136 people -- 99 in Malawi, 20 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nThe last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

                    "body": "UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The world body readies itself for response as Cyclone Freddy slammed into central Mozambique over the weekend with winds of 148 km per hour, UN humanitarians said on Monday.\n\n\"It made its landfall for the second time over the weekend in Mozambique, dumping as much rain in 24 hours as would usually fall in one month,\" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said. \"Homes have been destroyed, basic services are affected, and livelihoods have been impacted. Thousands of people have sought refuge in temporary accommodation centers.\"\n\nAs feared, after hitting Mozambique's mid-section Saturday, Freddy's somewhat diminished wind and rain also hit southern Malawi. Heavy rains and strong winds triggered landslides, damaging houses and public infrastructure.\n\n\"The UN and our humanitarian partners are working closely with both governments to respond to Freddy and to cholera,\" the office said. Both countries are battling a cholera outbreak, with their efforts hampered by the storm.\n\nThe cumulative number of cholera cases is 8,465 in Mozambique, an increase of 1,114 in the last week, OCHA said.\n\nAid workers were deployed before the storm to the target area of Freddy, OCHA said. They are assessing the storm's impact in support of the government-led response. Power and communications are down in many affected regions, hindering aid operations.\n\nIn Malawi, humanitarian partners are working closely with the government to coordinate the response, the humanitarian office said. Workers stockpiled relief items ahead of the storm, and communities were warned about the possible impacts of the cyclone.\n\n\"In both countries, humanitarian partners urgently need additional resources to respond to the emergencies,\" OCHA said.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization said Freddy was first named a tropical cyclone when spotted on Feb. 6 between the northwest coast of Australia and Indonesia. It crossed the entire South Indian Ocean, traveling more than 8,000 km, before ripping across Madagascar into the Mozambique Channel, restrengthening and hitting Mozambique for the first time on Feb. 24.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which measures accumulated cyclone energy, said Freddy's energy is equivalent to an average entire North Atlantic hurricane season. \u25a0",

                    "body": "One of the strongest storms recorded in the southern hemisphere hit region for second time in a month\n\nMozambique and Malawi have been left counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 100 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nThe storm has killed 99 people in Malawi, including 85 in the main commercial hub of Blantyre, said the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, Charles Kalemba, on Monday.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now about 136.\n\nThe central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that about 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nPolice spokesperson, Peter Kalaya, told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, the country's second-largest city, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nMalawi's national electricity company EGENCO said that power generation capacity was unstable and that it had experienced total system shutdown twice on Monday. It has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.\n\nAt least 10 people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" health minister, Armindo Tiago, said on public radio.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Unicef in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "By Vitus-Gregory Gondwe and Wanjohi Kabukuru, Associated Press\n\nAn unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the centre of the country, have died, with several others missing or injured.\n\nAuthorities in Mozambique reported that five people had been killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report.\n\nA three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our south-west, south-east and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told The Associated Press.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday.\n\nIt is the second time the record-breaking cyclone - which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February - made landfall in mainland Africa.\n\nIt also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time.\n\nFreddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean.\n\nIt is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone.\n\nThe UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear.\n\nTelecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring centre in Reunion warned on Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on.\n\nMozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks.\n\nThe cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure\".\n\nFreddy is expected to weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to Meteo-France.",

                    "body": "It is the second time the cyclone - which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February - made landfall in mainland Africa.\n\nAn unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the centre of the country, have died, with several others missing or injured.\n\nAuthorities in Mozambique reported that five people had been killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our south-west, south-east and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told The Associated Press.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday.\n\nIt is the second time the record-breaking cyclone - which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February - made landfall in mainland Africa.\n\nIt also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time.\n\nFreddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean.\n\nIt is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear.\n\nTelecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring centre in Reunion warned on Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on.\n\nMozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks.\n\nThe cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure\".\n\nFreddy is expected to weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to Meteo-France.",

                    "body": "Mozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 100 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummeled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nThe storm has killed 99 people in Malawi, including 85 in the main commercial hub of Blantyre, said the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, Charles Kalemba, at a press briefing.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now around 136.\n\nThe central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, the country's second-largest city, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nMalawi's national electricity company EGENCO said that power generation capacity was unstable and that it had experienced total system shutdown twice on Monday. It has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.\n\nAt least ten people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localized flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report.\n\nA three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa.\n\nIt also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time.\n\nFreddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season. \u25a0",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Tropical Cyclone Freddy in Malawi reached 99 Monday evening with 85 deaths recorded in the commercial city of Blantyre alone, authorities have confirmed.\n\nCommissioner for the Department of Disaster and Management Affairs (DoDMA), Charles Kalemba, confirmed the development at a press briefing held in Blantyre Monday evening, adding that thousands have also been displaced.\n\nKalemba said Blantyre has recorded 134 serious injuries while several other injuries and loss of property have been recorded across the 10 districts that have been heavily affected by the cyclone.\n\nThe loss of lives has been due to the collapse of residential houses, flash floods, and landslides in the affected districts including Blantyre where one of the mountains, Soche, broke loose releasing a huge flow of water, heavy rocks, and mud that swept a number of homes and burried residents in the process.\n\nThe cyclone has also destroyed power generation infrastructure, leaving almost the entire country in blackout since Monday morning.\n\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has declared a state of emergency in the 10 districts that have been heavily affected in the southern region.",

                    "body": "At least fifteen people have died in Malawi and Mozambique as Cyclone Freddy hit the two countries with torrential rains and strong winds upon its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday.\n\nPolice in Malawi said 11 people died in areas surrounding the southern city of Blantyre, where heavy rains triggered flooding as the cyclone made a comeback, just weeks after it first struck the continent.\n\nAt least 16 more people were missing and four injured, according to a preliminary count, police said.\n\nFour more people died in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said, as an assessment of the damage was underway after the storm made its second landfall in the country on Saturday.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, said his sister in law's family was swept away by flash floods in Chilobwe, a township south of Blantyre.\n\n\"We got a call from the neighbours at around five am to say that 'your relations have been washed away by the rains',\" Duwa, a government clerk told AFP.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have just recovered one body, a small boy, but the remaining four are not to be seen.\"\n\nEarlier police said they found the body of a three-year-old girl after a water stream breached its banks washing away houses built along its course.\n\nMalawi's government ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to continue to batter the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather mid-flight and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\n\"It was thought wise to return to Lilongwe,\" said Malawi Airlines spokesman Only Taulo.\n\nFreddy reached the landlocked country early Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nIn Mozambique, at least three people died in Namacura, a town in the central Zambezia province, according to district head Moura Xavier.\n\nALSO READ: Cyclone Freddy on its way back to Mozambique, will bypass SA\n\nOne more was reported dead at the weekend, after a house collapsed in the nearby district of Zalala.\n\nThe death toll was expected to increase, as authorities worked to reach all affected areas.\n\n\"We are experiencing communication difficulties and this situation does not allow us to have reliable tolls,\" said Health Minister Armindo Tiago.\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said rains had abated on Monday but the hard-hit coastal city of Quelimane remained without access to clean running water.\n\nFlooding affected parts of the city, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of damage,\" Taylor said by phone. \"In the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed\".\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and barrelled through Madagascar from February 21, crossing the island before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nALSO READ: SANParks on high alert after Cyclone Freddy warnings\n\nDuring its first deadly visit to the country it affected about 166,000 people.\n\nUpon its return it carried even stronger winds and rains, Taylor said.\n\n\"We are prioritising rescuing people and removing the lifeless bodies. We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\"\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 42 people -- 11 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.",

                    "body": "Mozambique and Malawi are counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy after it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend, leaving a trail of destruction and killing more than 60 people.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's main commercial hub of Blantyre, the central hospital had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said.\n\n\"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nCasualties were still arriving from affected areas, said Chipiliro Khamula, spokesperson for the department of disaster management.\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in the country's second-largest city Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Mr Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique's Quelimane, which was struck hard by the storm, authorities told the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nScores more people were injured, Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on Radio Mozambique.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UN children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "Mozambique and Malawi are counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which has killed more than 100 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nThe storm has killed 99 people in Malawi, including 85 in the main commercial hub of Blantyre, the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs Charles Kalemba said at a press briefing.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now about 135.\n\nThe central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said.\n\n\"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nPolice spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, the country's second-largest city, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nMalawi's electricity company EGENCO said that power generation capacity was unstable and that it had experienced total system shutdown twice on Monday.\n\nIt has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.\n\nAt least ten people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy for United Nations children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has had more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.",

It has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.\n\nAt least ten people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters Branches of trees sway as cyclone Freddy hits, in Quelimane\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters Branches of trees sway as cyclone Freddy hits, in Quelimane\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: Satellite imagery show Cyclone Freddy approaching Madagascar\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.\n\n(Additional reporting by Carien du Plessis and Tim Cocks in Johannesburg; Writing by Alexander Winning and Nellie Peyton;Editing by Tim Cocks, Sharon Singleton, Nick Macfie and Aurora Ellis)\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy lashed Malawi early Monday morning after making landfall for a second time in a month in Mozambique on Sunday, killing more than 100 people between the two countries.\n\nFreddy made landfall with sustained winds of nearly 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour), causing \"severe damage and cutting off children and families from critical services,\" UNICEF, which provides rapid response to disaster-struck areas, said in a statement.\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane in Mozambique Sunday, the storm continued inland towards the southern tip of neighboring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nDestructive winds and heavy rainfall brought down trees and damaged rooftops in both countries, with Malawi having borne the brunt of the inexhaustible storm.\n\nState television station MBC said on Monday at least 99 people died in Malawi, raising the death toll from the 56 reported earlier in the day.\n\nPresident Lazarus Chakwera declared a state of emergency for the southern region of the country, where the worst effects had been felt, on Monday.\n\nAt least 85 people died in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country. Police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that two townships in Blantyre -- Chilobwe and Ndirande -- were still being hit by rain on Monday evening as rescue teams continued to search for survivors.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least ten people have died in Mozambique since Saturday, local authorities said, but the true extent of the damage and loss of life was unclear as phone and power lines in the worst-hit areas had been brought down.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.\n\nFreddy first wreaked havoc last month, having killed at least 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar.\n\nMozambique has seen more rain in the past four weeks than it normally receives in a year.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the storm and more than half a million were at risk in Mozambique this time, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned.\n\nFreddy also hit as Malawi is experiencing the worst cholera outbreak in its history.\n\nThe storm, which originated in the Indian Ocean in early February became the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization.",

                    "body": "The deadly and destructive journey for long-lasting Tropical Cyclone Freddy is nearly over after the storm made its third and final landfall more than one month after its initial formation, AccuWeather forecasters say.\n\nAfter being named on Feb. 6, Freddy took a westward track across the Indian Ocean, spinning from just northwest of Australia all the way to eastern Africa. Freddy has been affecting Madagascar and southeastern Africa for nearly two weeks, making three total landfalls and killing more than 90 people in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi.\n\nThe death toll surged in Malawi on Monday, as at least 66 deaths were blamed on the storm, with officials saying there were more than 90 injured and 16 people still missing.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by AccuWeather People cross a raging river in Blantyre, Malawi, Monday, March 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Thoko Chikondi)\n\nThe powerful winds and torrential rain from Freddy have significantly cut communications and electricity supply to Mozambique following its landfall this past weekend. Freddy is now a tropical rainstorm, or an overland depression, according to Meteo France. As such, officials fear that the extent of damage and the number of fatalities may rise.\n\nMore than a month's worth of rain has fallen in Mozambique during the past four weeks, according to the BBC. An estimated 1.5 million people have been affected since the storm first hit last month, according to Mozambique's National Disaster Management Agency, and more than 8,000 people are likely to be left homeless.\n\nFreddy has lingered in the Indian Ocean basin as a named tropical cyclone for a total of 35 days and is likely now the longest-lasting named tropical system in history. The previous record was held by Typhoon John in 1994, which survived for 31 days. The World Meteorological Organization is expected to confirm this record in the near future.\n\nGET THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP\n\nHave the app?

Freddy then went on to meander through the Mozambique Channel for another two weeks, before two landfalls in Mozambique.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by AccuWeather The above image on AccuWeather's Hurricane Tracker shows Freddy's path across the Indian Ocean from Feb. 6 to its final landfall on March 11.\n\nDuring that time, Freddy's strength fluctuated, reaching the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic or East Pacific Ocean Basins more than once. Freddy was only the 20th tropical cyclone to reach this strength in the South Indian Ocean since 1989. In fact, Freddy re-intensified a total of seven times and traveled more than 5,500 miles.\n\nAs a long-duration storm, Freddy's accumulated cyclone energy, referred to as ACE, was exceptionally high. ACE is a measure of a storm's intensity over its lifetime.\n\nAccording to Colorado State University, the ACE for Freddy is 84.7 as of March 13, which is more than the average total ACE of an entire Atlantic hurricane season. This ACE value is not only the highest ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, but it's also close to the total ACE of Hurricane Ioke from 1980, the current world record-holder for a single cyclone at around 85.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by AccuWeather The above AccuWeather RealVue Satellite shows Freddy making landfall in Madagascar on Feb. 21.\n\nAfter more than a month prowling the Indian Ocean and wreaking havoc over land, forecasters say Freddy could still pose additional concerns.\n\nAccuWeather Meteorologist Alyssa Smithmyer says that Freddy is likely to drift southeastward over the next few days, continuing to become disorganized as it moves back into the Mozambique Channel.\n\nFreddy has gone through this area frequently in recent weeks, promoting the upwelling of the waters in the channel. Upwelling is the process of very cold water, deep below the ocean surface being mixed in with the warmer water at the surface. Powerful tropical systems naturally will do this when they move through a body of water.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by AccuWeather This Meteosat-9 satellite shows Tropical Cyclone Freddy ahead of its first landfall in Mozambique on Friday, Feb. 24, 2023. (Photo/NOAA)\n\n\"The recent upwelling in the region has brought ocean surface temperatures down low enough that it would be unlikely for Freddy to regain wind intensity,\" Smithmyer explained, adding that an increase in wind shear over the region will also likely be an inhibiting factor.\n\nHowever, the lingering moisture from Freddy could push into southern parts of Madagascar for the middle of the week, adding even more rain to the already drenched area.\n\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

                    "body": "More than 60 bodies have been recovered in Malawi's main commercial hub of Blantyre after Tropical Storm Freddy hit southern Africa for the second time in a month.\n\nStrong winds and rains continue to cause severe destruction.\n\n\"We have rivers overflowing, we have people being carried away by running waters, we have buildings collapsing,\" police spokesman Peter Kalaya told BBC Focus on Africa radio.\n\nMalawi was \"overwhelmed\" he added.\n\nRelentless rain and strong winds have hampered overstretched emergency teams in the country's southern and central regions, which are worst affected, Kalaya said.\n\nVictims taken to a hospital in Blantyre had injuries caused by falling trees, landslides and flash floods, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director, Marion Pechayre told Reuters news agency.\n\n\"A lot of [homes] are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads,\" she is quoted as saying.\n\nCasualties were still arriving from affected areas, said Chipiliro Khamula, spokesperson for Malawi's department of disaster management. Officials expect the death toll to rise as some areas remain cut off.\n\nFreddy is the strongest tropical cyclone on record and could also be the long-lasting one, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nOn Sunday the storm struck Mozambique as a cyclone - for the second time in a less than a month after battering the island nation of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, causing severe destruction.\n\nIt has been difficult to determine the extent of the damage caused in Mozambique and the number of deaths as power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected areas.\n\nThe timing of the storm could exacerbate Malawi's cholera outbreak, the UN and other agencies have warned, as the country battles one of its worst public heath crises.\n\nExperts says climate change is making tropical storms around the world wetter, windier and more intense.\n\nFreddy had broken records for the strength it has accumulated over the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean from north-western Australia.",

                    "body": "Blantyre, Malawi - Malawi has diverted flights and suspended schools in its southern districts due to Cyclone Freddy, which has killed at least 40 people, according to the country's disaster management agency.\n\nCyclone Freddy hit Malawi on Friday and has caused damage in at least 10 districts in the country's south.\n\nThe government in Lilongwe suspended schools in southern Malawi until further notice. In Blantyre, authorities suspended flights at the Chileka International airport for much of Sunday and Monday.\n\n'Our officers have been deployed to rescue and provide other services to people who need rescue and we are in each of the districts because we also have police stations in these districts,' said Peter Kalaya, spokesman for Malawi's Police Service. 'But suffice to say our efforts are being hampered by the effects of the rains because the rains are still falling.'\n\nMen dig in search of survivors and victims in the mud and debris left by Cyclone Freddy in Chilobwe, Blantyre, Malawi, March 13, 2023.\n\nKalaya said the death toll will likely rise, as they expect reports from nine other affected districts.\n\nChipiliro Khamula, spokesman for Malawi's Department of Disaster Preparedness, told VOA Monday rescue efforts were underway by police, the military and the Malawi Red Cross.\n\n'We have also set up a national emergency operations center in Limbe to facilitate coordination of preparedness interventions,' Khamula said. 'Again we have also stockpiled some relief items at the humanitarian staging area in Bangula, at our Blantyre warehouse, and in some districts for effective and efficient provision of relief items in affected areas.'\n\nYobu Kachiwanda, spokesperson for Malawi's Meteorological Department, said the cyclone has started to weaken and is expected to leave Malawi soon.\n\n'Projection is that it is still there in the next 24 to 48 hours, and will go back into Mozambique Channel as usual towards mid-week into the weekend,' Kachiwanda said.\n\nCyclone Freddy first appeared more than a month ago and is believed to be the longest-lasting storm in the region for the past 20 years. Since February, the cyclone has left scores of people dead across Madagascar and twice-hit Mozambique.\n\nThe storm is also expected to hit parts of Zambia and Zimbabwe this week.",

                    "body": "Blantyre, Malawi - Malawi has diverted flights and suspended schools in its southern districts due to Cyclone Freddy, which has killed at least 40 people, according to the country's disaster management agency.\n\nCyclone Freddy hit Malawi on Friday and has caused damage in at least 10 districts in the country's south.\n\nThe government in Lilongwe suspended schools in southern Malawi until further notice. In Blantyre, authorities suspended flights at the Chileka International airport for much of Sunday and Monday.\n\n'Our officers have been deployed to rescue and provide other services to people who need rescue and we are in each of the districts because we also have police stations in these districts,' said Peter Kalaya, spokesman for Malawi's Police Service. 'But suffice to say our efforts are being hampered by the effects of the rains because the rains are still falling.'\n\nMen dig in search of survivors and victims in the mud and debris left by Cyclone Freddy in Chilobwe, Blantyre, Malawi, March 13, 2023.\n\nKalaya said the death toll will likely rise, as they expect reports from nine other affected districts.\n\nChipiliro Khamula, spokesman for Malawi's Department of Disaster Preparedness, told VOA Monday rescue efforts were underway by police, the military and the Malawi Red Cross.\n\n'We have also set up a national emergency operations center in Limbe to facilitate coordination of preparedness interventions,' Khamula said. 'Again we have also stockpiled some relief items at the humanitarian staging area in Bangula, at our Blantyre warehouse, and in some districts for effective and efficient provision of relief items in affected areas.'\n\nYobu Kachiwanda, spokesperson for Malawi's Meteorological Department, said the cyclone has started to weaken and is expected to leave Malawi soon.\n\n'Projection is that it is still there in the next 24 to 48 hours, and will go back into Mozambique Channel as usual towards mid-week into the weekend,' Kachiwanda said.\n\nCyclone Freddy first appeared more than a month ago and is believed to be the longest-lasting storm in the region for the past 20 years. Since February, the cyclone has left scores of people dead across Madagascar and twice-hit Mozambique.\n\nThe storm is also expected to hit parts of Zambia and Zimbabwe this week.",

Chakwera is currently in Qatar and it's unclear if he will cut his trip short to deal with the crisis.\n\nThe declaration will allow the government to accelerate its response to the storm that made landfall Sunday, striking the nation for a second time in a month.\n\nThe cyclone has killed 99 people and affected about 10,000, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs said late Monday.\n\nMany parts of the nation are in darkness and utility company, Electricity Supply Corp. of Malawi is struggling to restore power.\n\nVast areas of crop land and livestock have been washed away, according to the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, which said it would quantify the extent of the damage in due course.\n\nFreddy, which appears to have become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone ever and was first named on Feb. 6, has also brought heavy rains and havoc to other African nations including Madagascar and Mozambique.\n\nRead more: Cyclone Freddy Sets New Record as World's Longest Tropical Storm",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nREAD MORE: Scientists confirm global floods and droughts worsened by climate change\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nREAD MORE: Atmospheric river floods California with more rain, snow\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nREAD MORE: Brazil flooding toll hits 44 as search continues for missing\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected to weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "Freddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization. It pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nMozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 100 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend. Freddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides. The full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nThe storm has killed 99 people in Malawi, including 85 in the main commercial hub of Blantyre, said the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, Charles Kalemba, at a press briefing. The total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now around 136.\n\nThe central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital. The injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, the country's second-largest city, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power. \"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nCRITICAL SITUATION Malawi's national electricity company EGENCO said that power generation capacity was unstable and that it had experienced total system shutdown twice on Monday. It has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.\n\nAt least ten people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional. \"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size. \"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said. Mozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse. Scientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.

                    "body": "One of the strongest storms ever recorded in southern hemisphere could be longest-lasting tropical cyclone\n\nMozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 60 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummeled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland toward Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's main commercial hub of Blantyre, the central hospital had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said.\n\n\"A lot of [houses] are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nCasualties were still arriving from affected areas, said Chipiliro Khamula, spokesperson for the department of disaster management.\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique's Quelimane, which was struck hard by the storm, authorities told the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nScores more people were injured, Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on Radio Mozambique.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\nThe total number killed by Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UN children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localized flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday, but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

Chakwera is currently in Qatar and it's unclear if he will cut his trip short to deal with the crisis.\n\nThe declaration will allow the government to accelerate its response to the storm that made landfall Sunday, striking the nation for a second time in a month.\n\nThe cyclone has killed 99 people and affected about 10,000, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs said late Monday.\n\nMany parts of the nation are in darkness and utility company, Electricity Supply Corp. of Malawi is struggling to restore power.\n\nVast areas of crop land and livestock have been washed away, according to the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, which said it would quantify the extent of the damage in due course.\n\nFreddy, which appears to have become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone ever and was first named on Feb. 6, has also brought heavy rains and havoc to other African nations including Madagascar and Mozambique.",

More people are still missing.\n\nBlantyre city was badly impacted, with regional police spokeswoman Beatrice Mikuwa saying at least 36 bodies were recovered in the township of Chilobwe \"which has been hit the most\", with dozens of houses were washed away.\n\nFreddy, on track to become one of the longest-lasting storms on record, barrelled through southern Africa at the weekend for the second time within weeks, making a comeback after a first hit in late February.",

French weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France warned of \"destructive and devastating\" winds and \"dangerous seas and heavy rains\" that could lead to landslides. It said Freddy will go further inland through the weekend, generating heavy rains in Mozambique and southern Malawi, with rain also likely in Zimbabwe and Zambia. It's the second time Freddy has hit the country, with the cyclone originally making landfall late last month.",

There are efforts on the way as UNICEF has partnered with other UN partners and government to ensure that there is continuity in giving support to these people, especially in the homes and evacuation centers which were opened,\" Guy Tailor, UNICEF spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nTailor noted that floods are posing a potential health disaster, adding: \"What we are concerned about is the ongoing rainfall, most parts of this region are flooded, especially the countryside. That poses a greater risk of an outbreak of water-borne diseases like cholera.\"\n\nIn Mozambique, there were power cuts in Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira, and parts of the city of Mocuba in the central party of the country.\n\nThere are fears the cyclone may not slow down soon as it is expected to return to the coast while gaining strength.\n\nCasualties in Malawi\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, Mozambique, the storm continued inland towards the southern tip of neighboring Malawi and by Sunday afternoon, serious floods and heavy winds were reported in the Mulanje district and heavy rains and flooding also resulted in blown-off roofs, power outages, as well as flooding in Blantyre.\n\nThe mudslides occurred when Tropical Cyclone Freddy hit the mountainous city as it swirled further inland from Mozambique.\n\nMalawi Police Service from Blantyre said searches are still ongoing, and that there is a possibility more people still missing might be found dead.\n\n\"Reference is made to the Tropical Cyclone Freddy being experienced in Blantyre and surrounding areas that death toll has now reached 63,\" Malawi Police Service official Superintendent Linzie said in a statement.\n\nChilobwe township has recorded the highest number of victims standing at 36 although other areas like Ndiramde, Manase, Chileka, Machinjiri, and Chigumbura.\n\nMeanwhile, the district council with support from partners has set up an evacuation camp at Naotcha Primary School.\n\nAlex Mdooko, the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development's district commissioner, said arrangements are underway to provide coffins and assistance for the bereaved families.\n\nOwing to Tropical Cyclone Freddy's second landfall that hit Malawi on Sunday, schools have also been suspended.\n\nSeveral roads have been damaged, there are floods in every low-lying area, and most parts of the city do not have electricity.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting storm, according to the World Meteorological Organization. -",

Having crossed the Mozambique Channel three times, Freddy is now making its second Mozambique landfall.\n\nOn Sunday, Freddy was centres near the mouth of the Zambezi River in and had winds of about 88 km/h. The storm crossed the coast on Saturday as the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane before gradually losing strength over land.\n\nThe storm was blamed for 27 deaths in Madagascar and Mozambique when it lashed the two countries last month. Amid its second landfall in Mozambique this weekend, at least one person has died, Reuters reports, but the full scope of the cyclone's toll is still unknown because \"communications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut\".\n\nFreddy's record-setting longevity\n\nFreddy attained Category 5 strength twice over the southern Indian Ocean in mid-February, and has been named for 34 days. That eclipses the previous world record-holder, Hurricane John, which spent 31 days as a named Pacific storm between August 11 and September 13, 1994.\n\nIn addition, Freddy has rapidly intensified an unprecedented seven times, compared with the previous record, which was four times. Rapid intensification describes a jump of 56km/h or greater in a storm's winds in 24 hours or less. While most major hurricanes and storms do rapidly intensify at least once, anything more than three times in a storm's life cycle is exceptional.\n\nThe world's most energetic tropical cyclone\n\nAfter smashing records for lasting so long and intensifying so many times, Freddy managed to become Earth's most energetic storm ever observed after reaching a key threshold this weekend.\n\nHow much energy a storm churns through is calculated through a metric known as ACE, or Accumulated Cyclone Energy. It reflects both a storm's intensity and duration. Storms harvest such energy from warm ocean waters and expend it through their winds and by generating precipitation.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, Freddy had tallied somewhere in the neighbourhood of 86 ACE units, surpassing the record of 85.26 set by hurricane and typhoon Ioke in August to September 2006. That's more ACE than 100 of the past 172 Atlantic hurricane seasons - not individual storms, but entire seasons' worth of ACE.\n\nWhile Freddy has broken records for rapid intensification, longevity and energy dispersed, it hasn't spent its whole life at hurricane strength. It weakened to a tropical storm after landfall in Madagascar on February 21 and a depression following its first landfall in Mozambique days later.\n\nWhat's next for Freddy\n\nIt's likely that Freddy will finally dissipate by late Monday or early Tuesday as it unloads its heavy rain in northern and central Mozambique. Some places could see roughly 63 centimetres.\n\nWhile the mid-level circulation left behind by Freddy's remnants may drift back south-east over the Mozambique Channel into Wednesday, the shredded tropical entrails don't look to have any chance of coming back to life.\n\nMeanwhile, Times360 reports that Department of Disaster Management Affairs Commissioner Charles Kalemba disclosed that so far total of 99 people have been confirmed dead in some districts in the Southern Region due to floods and landslides emanating from Cyclone Freddy.\n\nHe has a press briefing currently underway in Blantyre, saying of these, Blantyre has the highest number at 85 but deaths have also been reported in Chikwawa, Nsanje and Chiradzulu districts.\n\nThe report quotes Kalemba as saying so far, 4,000 households have been affected, which translates to over 10,000 people. -- Reported by Justin Mkweu, Times360",

                    "body": "LILONGWE, Malawi -- Cyclone Freddy, the longest-lasting tropical cyclone ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, swept in from the southeastern coast of Africa and traveled to the landlocked nation of Malawi, where by Monday it was responsible for at least 66 deaths, the Red Cross said.\n\nLarge swaths of Blantyre, the second-largest city in Malawi, were hit by flooding and mudslides, and the government declared a state of disaster.\n\nSchools were closed, flights were canceled, and rescue workers frantically dug through mud and collapsed buildings in an effort to save lives. Police and aid workers said they anticipated that there would be more found dead and injured.\n\n\"The figures might rise because there is a lot of rubble, especially in Blantyre,\" said Felix Washoni, spokesman for the Red Cross in Malawi. \"There might be some bodies that are buried in the rubble.\"\n\nThe storm has raged for 35 days, breaking the record for the longest and most sustained storm in the southern hemisphere, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nIt has caused major destruction in three countries: hitting the island nation of Madagascar, making landfall in Mozambique on the mainland on Saturday, and moving farther northwest into Malawi on Sunday.\n\nIn Mozambique, where 10 people have been reported killed, the authorities also expected the death toll to rise as rescue workers struggled to reach towns and villages cut off by the flooding.\n\n\"We have seen quite widespread devastation,\" Guy Taylor, spokesman for the United Nations children's agency Unicef, said from Quelimane, one of the worst hit towns in Mozambique. \"Roofs ripped off of schools, of homes, of hospitals and clinics.\"\n\nIn its unusual track, Cyclone Freddy has circled around and twice hit Mozambique and the island nation of Madagascar. On Freddy's first pass through Mozambique, starting on Feb. 24, it left 10 people dead. In Madagascar, 17 people were killed.\n\nThe storm was still \"alive\" on Monday, said Wayne Venter, a meteorologist with the South African Weather Service. This could make Cyclone Freddy a contender for the longest-running storm in history, according to the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency. More than 24 hours after it made landfall, heavy rain continued to fall in both Malawi and Mozambique.\n\nThe storm appeared more than a month ago and was named on Feb. 6, as it took shape near the northern coast of Australia. Then it began a journey of more than 4,000 miles across the Indian Ocean. Meteorologists have not seen that path in two decades, and only three other storms have been recorded traveling from the east to the west of the Indian Ocean, according to a tracking agency at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization has set up a committee to evaluate whether Freddy had become the longest-lasting storm anywhere in the world, taking into account Freddy's shifts in intensity. The record holder is Hurricane John, a storm in the Pacific in 1994 that lasted 31 days.\n\nAt its peak, Freddy sustained wind speeds of about 160 miles per hour, the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane, as such storms are known when they form in the Atlantic.\n\nCyclone Freddy's devastation could worsen a cholera outbreak already underway in Malawi and Mozambique, authorities warned. In Malawi, more than 1,600 people have already died in the past year from cholera, a waterborne bacterial disease. With clinics and hospitals now destroyed and floodwaters spreading, both countries will struggle to contain the outbreak.\n\nGolden Matonga reported from Lilongwe, Malawi, and Lynsey Chutel from East London, South Africa.",

                    "body": "Malawi has diverted flights and suspended schools in its southern districts due to Cyclone Freddy, which has killed at least 40 people, according to the country's disaster management agency.\n\nCyclone Freddy hit Malawi on Friday and has caused damage in at least 10 districts in the country's south.\n\nThe government in Lilongwe suspended schools in southern Malawi until further notice. In Blantyre, authorities suspended flights at the Chileka International airport for much of Sunday and Monday.\n\n\"Our officers have been deployed to rescue and provide other services to people who need rescue and we are in each of the districts because we also have police stations in these districts,\" said Peter Kalaya, spokesman for Malawi's Police Service. \"But suffice to say our efforts are being hampered by the effects of the rains because the rains are still falling.\"\n\nKalaya said the death toll will likely rise, as they expect reports from nine other affected districts.\n\nChipiliro Khamula, spokesman for Malawi's Department of Disaster Preparedness, told VOA Monday rescue efforts were underway by police, the military and the Malawi Red Cross.\n\n\"We have also set up a national emergency operations center in Limbe to facilitate coordination of preparedness interventions,\" Khamula said. \"Again we have also stockpiled some relief items at the humanitarian staging area in Bangula, at our Blantyre warehouse, and in some districts for effective and efficient provision of relief items in affected areas.\"\n\nYobu Kachiwanda, spokesperson for Malawi's Meteorological Department, said the cyclone has started to weaken and is expected to leave Malawi soon.\n\n\"Projection is that it is still there in the next 24 to 48 hours, and will go back into Mozambique Channel as usual towards mid-week into the weekend,\" Kachiwanda said.\n\nCyclone Freddy first appeared more than a month ago and is believed to be the longest-lasting storm in the region for the past 20 years. Since February, the cyclone has left scores of people dead across Madagascar and twice-hit Mozambique.\n\nThe storm is also expected to hit parts of Zambia and Zimbabwe this week.",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\n[Deadly cyclone Freddy has become Earth's longest-lived tropical storm on record]\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\n___",

Officials expect the death toll to rise as some areas remain cut off.\n\nFreddy is the strongest tropical cyclone on record and could also be the long-lasting one, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nOn Sunday the storm struck Mozambique as a cyclone - for the second time in a less than a month after battering the island nation of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, causing severe destruction.\n\nIt has been difficult to determine the extent of the damage caused in Mozambique and the number of deaths as power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected areas.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters A man walks among the debris with his bicycle on a flooded street near Mozambique's port city of Quelimane\n\nThe timing of the storm could exacerbate Malawi's cholera outbreak, the UN and other agencies have warned, as the country battles one of its worst public heath crises.\n\nExperts says climate change is making tropical storms around the world wetter, windier and more intense.\n\nFreddy had broke records for the strength it has accumulated over the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean from north-western Australia.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by BBC News Map Continue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

We don\u2019t have numbers,\u201d said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia. \u201cThe most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\u201d\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the UN children\u2019s agency Unicef, said rains had abated on Monday but the hard-hit Mozambique coastal city of Quelimane remained without access to clean running water.\n\nFlooding affected parts of the city, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of damage,\u201d Taylor said by phone. \u201cIn the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed\u201d.\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off northwestern Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from February 21 before reaching Mozambique on February 24. Following what meteorologists describe as a \u201crare\u201d loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nUpon its return it carried even stronger winds and rains, Taylor said.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 97 people \u2013 66 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nThe last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Tropical Cyclones Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

On track to be classified as the longest cyclone ever recorded by meteorologists, Freddy had already affected Madagascar and Mozambique at the end of February.\n\nThe toll was then 17 dead, thousands displaced and houses devastated. Returning to the region last week following an unprecedented loop trajectory, it first fell on Madagascar for the second time in two weeks, causing 10 deaths. Then, it returned to strike Mozambique on Saturday evening. At least four people died in the province of Zamb\u00e9zia (center), open to the Mozambique Channel, local authorities told AFP. But the balance sheet is likely to climb, information reaching with difficulty due to cut communications.\n\nThe port city of Quelimane (center), about 40 km from where the cyclone landed, is still largely isolated from the rest of the world: roads, water, electricity are cut in places, according to Guy Taylor, spokesperson of Unicef on the spot reached by telephone. Many people are missing, according to the authorities. And the disaster seems to have exceeded fears: \"Emergency accommodation centers have been overwhelmed, because the number of people affected has been higher than expected,\" Luisa Meque, president of the national management office, told AFP. disasters.\n\nStrong winds torrential rains\n\nThe cyclone which was accompanied by strong winds and torrential rains then moved overnight from Sunday to Monday towards neighboring Malawi, causing flooding and significant mudslides.\n\nSchools in the country among the poorest in the world have been closed in much of the south. Most of the bodies were found in the Blantyre region (south), Malawi's economic capital, according to local police.\n\n\"Relief operations are still ongoing, but they are hampered by the incessant rains,\" Beatrice Mikuwa, spokeswoman, told AFP. swept away and their occupants buried in the mud, noted an AFP journalist.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, a civil servant, told AFP the water suddenly rose in the middle of the night .\n\nAt 03:00 GMT (05:00 local time), he received a phone call: five members of his family living in the township were taken away. \"We have just found the body of a little boy, but the others are still not found\" , he said. He has to go to the morgue. Bodies have been found downstream, believed to be his relatives. The national flag carrier, Malawi Airlines, has canceled all flights to Blantyre until further notice. Freddy, who has now claimed around 100 lives , should leave by the sea during the week and weaken, according to forecasts.\n\nThe phenomenon, formed off the coast of Australia and which reached the stage of storm at the beginning of February, rages in the Indian Ocean for 35 days. It passed off the French island of Reunion and Mauritius causing limited damage there. Several storms or cyclones cross the southwest Indian Ocean each year during the hurricane season which extends from November to April .",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy, packing powerful winds and torrential rain, killed at least 70 people in Malawi and Mozambique on its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday.\n\nMore than 60 bodies were found during the day in southern Malawi where heavy downpours triggered flooding, according to the Red Cross.\n\n\"Sixty-six people have died in Malawi, 93 injured and 16 people are missing due to Tropical Cyclone Freddy,\" tweeted the humanitarian organisation, which is helping with search and rescue operations.\n\nFour more died in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said.\n\nAn assessment of the damage was still underway, with the Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD) saying the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\n\"The number of affected people was above the forecast,\" INGD head Luisa Meque said, adding the storm struck also areas that had been \"deemed safe\".\n\nFreddy, a major cyclone on track to become the longest-lasting on record, barrelled through southern Africa at the weekend for the second time within a few weeks, making a comeback after a first hit in late February.\n\nALSO READ: Trump offered chance to testify to New York grand jury\n\nIn Malawi, Blantyre city was badly impacted, with regional police spokeswoman Beatrice Mikuwa saying 36 bodies were recovered in the township of Chilobwe \"which has been hit the most\", with dozens of houses washed away.\n\n\"Rescue efforts are still underway but they are being hampered by the incessant rains,\" said Mikuwa.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, said his sister-in-law's family was swept away by flash floods.\n\n\"We got a call from the neighbours at around five am to say that 'your relations have been washed away by the rains',\" Duwa, a government clerk, told AFP.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have just recovered one body, a small boy, but the remaining four are not to be seen.\"\n\nMalawi's government ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to continue to batter the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather mid-flight and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\nALSO READ: India, Australia pledge to strengthen defence ties\n\nFreddy reached the landlocked country early Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nIn Mozambique, at least three people died in Namacura, a town in the central Zambezia province, according to district head Moura Xavier.\n\nOne more was reported dead at the weekend, after a house collapsed in the nearby district of Zalala.\n\nThe death toll was expected to increase, as authorities worked to reach all affected areas.\n\n\"We are prioritising rescuing people and removing the lifeless bodies. We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\nALSO READ: The U.S. is playing border politics again\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\"\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said rains had abated on Monday but the hard-hit Mozambique coastal city of Quelimane remained without access to clean running water.\n\nFlooding affected parts of the city, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of damage,\" Taylor said by phone. \"In the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed\".\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from February 21 before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nALSO READ: Heist gone wrong claims two lives at Chile airport\n\nUpon its return it carried even stronger winds and rains, Taylor said.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 97 people -- 66 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nThe last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Tropical Cyclones Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy, packing powerful winds and torrential rain, killed at least 70 people in Malawi and Mozambique on its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday. In total, the storm has so far killed at least 97 people.\n\nMore than 60 bodies were found during the day in southern Malawi where heavy downpours triggered flooding, according to the Red Cross.\n\n\"Sixty-six people have died in Malawi, 93 injured and 16 people are missing due to Tropical Cyclone Freddy,\" tweeted the humanitarian organization, which is helping with search and rescue operations.\n\nFour more died in neighboring Mozambique, local authorities said.\n\nAn assessment of the damage was still underway, with the Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management saying the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\n\"The number of affected people was above the forecast,\" agency head Luisa Meque said, adding the storm also struck areas that had been \"deemed safe.\"\n\nFreddy, a major cyclone on track to become the longest-lasting on record, barreled through southern Africa over the weekend for the second time within a few weeks, making a comeback after a first hit in late February.\n\nAt its strongest point during its journey, the U.S. government's National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service said the cyclone was \"equivalent to a Category 5 Atlantic hurricane.\" Freddy has recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nIn Malawi, Blantyre city was badly impacted, with regional police spokeswoman Beatrice Mikuwa saying 36 bodies were recovered in the township of Chilobwe \"which has been hit the most\" with dozens of houses washed away.\n\n\"Rescue efforts are still underway but they are being hampered by the incessant rains,\" said Mikuwa.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, said his sister-in-law's family was swept away by flash floods.\n\n\"We got a call from the neighbors at around 5 a.m. to say that, 'Your relations have been washed away by the rains,'\" Duwa, a government clerk, told AFP.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have just recovered one body, a small boy, but the remaining four are not to be seen.\"\n\nMalawi's government ordered schools in 10 southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to continue to batter the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been canceled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather midflight and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\nFreddy reached the landlocked country early Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique over the weekend.\n\nIn Mozambique, at least three people died in Namacura, a town in the central Zambezia province, according to district head Moura Xavier.\n\nOne more was reported dead over the weekend, after a house collapsed in the nearby district of Zalala.\n\nThe death toll was expected to increase, as authorities worked to reach all affected areas.\n\n\"We are prioritizing rescuing people and removing the lifeless bodies. We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\"\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, said rains had abated on Monday but the hard-hit Mozambique coastal city of Quelimane remained without access to clean running water.\n\nFlooding affected parts of the city, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of damage,\" Taylor said by phone. \"In the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the Red Cross in Malawi tweeted video of the raging Thuchira River that triggered flooding nearby.\n\nAccording to the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, Freddy, which formed off northwestern Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar starting February 21 before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back toward Madagascar before moving once more toward Mozambique.\n\nUpon its return it carried even stronger winds and rains, Taylor said.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 97 people -- 66 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nThe last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Tropical Cyclones Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: Satellite imagery show Cyclone Freddy approaching Madagascar\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nLoad Error\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.\n\n(Additional reporting by Carien du Plessis and Tim Cocks in Johannesburg; Writing by Alexander Winning and Nellie Peyton;Editing by Tim Cocks, Sharon Singleton and Nick Macfie)\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

There are efforts on the way as UNICEF has partnered with other UN partners and government to ensure that there is continuity in giving support to these people, especially in the homes and evacuation centers which were opened,\" Guy Tailor, UNICEF spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nTailor noted that floods are posing a potential health disaster, adding: \"What we are concerned about is the ongoing rainfall, most parts of this region are flooded, especially the countryside. That poses a greater risk of an outbreak of water-borne diseases like cholera.\"\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm continued inland towards the southern tip of neighboring Malawi and by Sunday afternoon, serious floods and heavy winds were reported in the Mulanje district and heavy rains and flooding also resulted in blown-off roofs, power outages, as well as flooding in Blantyre.\n\nIn Mozambique, there were power cuts in Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira, and parts of the city of Mocuba in the central party of the country.\n\nThere are fears the cyclone may not slow down soon as it is expected to return to the coast while gaining strength. -",

                    "body": "Freddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's main commercial hub of Blantyre, the central hospital had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nCasualties were still arriving from affected areas, said Chipiliro Khamula, spokesperson for the department of disaster management.\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in the country's second-largest city Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique's Quelimane, which was struck hard by the storm, authorities told the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nScores more people were injured, Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on Radio Mozambique.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UN children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could now get worse. Scientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "Central Mozambique has suffered severe flooding and damage to infrastructure as Cyclone Freddy sweeps across the country for the second time in less than a month, killing at least five.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the Quelimane district of Zambezia province on Saturday night, battering the region with wind speeds of up to 213 km/hour and leaving the entire city of Quelimane without power, water or access to most cell phone networks.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of buildings destroyed, roofs ripped off, many trees fallen and widespread flooding, so I wouldn't be surprised if there have been fatalities,\" Guy Taylor, UNICEF's chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships, told Zitamar from a village just outside Quelimane.\n\nThe damage in the city has been extensive but the situation in the surrounding rural areas is even more critical, according to Taylor. \"Many houses have collapsed, flooded or been destroyed by fallen trees. Many of the fields and crops have been flooded which will be a major problem for subsistence farmers,\" he said.\n\nThe cyclone was more intense than anticipated, Zito Ossumane, a local journalist in Quelimane, told Zitamar on Monday. \"Even the government disaster management team did not expect such a magnitude of damage and has so far not provided an effective response to the victims.\"\n\n\"People have been left homeless after losing their roofs,\" he said. \"Many displaced families are sheltering in schools which have been turned into reception centres. Large areas are flooded and the rain is still falling.\"\n\nThe Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (INAM) expects 200mm of rain to fall over 24 hours, posing additional humanitarian challenges. \"The worry with this kind of flooding, beyond the immediate devastation, is you have long term disruption which cuts children and families off from essential basic services,\" Taylor said.\n\nThe extent of the damage and the number of casualties and displaced are still unclear due to communication difficulties in Quelimane but the city's mayor said on Monday that at least five people have been killed, 5,000 are living in temporary accommodation and about 100,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance. The roof was also blown off the old provincial hospital in Quelimane, impeding the treatment of victims.\n\nMovitel and Vodacom restored connectivity on Monday but the networks have been overloaded and are still unreliable.\n\nState electricity operator EDM announced on Monday that 116,000 of its customers are still without power in the provinces of Zambezia, Sofala and Manica.\n\nFreddy continues to move across Mozambique but on Sunday afternoon INAM reported its average wind speed had reduced to 95 km/hour, downgrading it to a severe tropical storm.\n\n10 people were killed when Freddy previously made landfall in Mozambique on 24 February, according to UNOCHA.\n\nFreddy is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone ever recorded, breaking 1994 Hurricane John's record of 31 days on Sunday. It also holds the record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, and is the only known cyclone to have rapidly intensified seven times.\n\nIt has now moved on into Malawi and Zimbabwe but is forecast to come back through Zambezia before heading back out to sea later this week.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy, packing powerful winds and torrential rain, killed at least 70 people in Malawi and Mozambique on its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday.\n\nMore than 60 bodies were found during the day in southern Malawi where heavy downpours triggered flooding, according to the Red Cross.\n\n\"Sixty-six people have died in Malawi, 93 injured and 16 people are missing due to Tropical Cyclone Freddy,\" tweeted the humanitarian organisation, which is helping with search and rescue operations.\n\nFour more died in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said.\n\nAn assessment of the damage was still underway, with the Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD) saying the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\n\"The number of affected people was above the forecast,\" INGD head Luisa Meque said, adding the storm struck also areas that had been \"deemed safe\".\n\nFreddy, a major cyclone on track to become the longest-lasting on record, barrelled through southern Africa at the weekend for the second time within a few weeks, making a comeback after a first hit in late February.\n\nIn Malawi, Blantyre city was badly impacted, with regional police spokeswoman Beatrice Mikuwa saying 36 bodies were recovered in the township of Chilobwe \"which has been hit the most\", with dozens of houses washed away.\n\n\"Rescue efforts are still underway but they are being hampered by the incessant rains,\" said Mikuwa.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, said his sister-in-law's family was swept away by flash floods.\n\n\"We got a call from the neighbours at around five am to say that 'your relations have been washed away by the rains',\" Duwa, a government clerk, told AFP.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have just recovered one body, a small boy, but the remaining four are not to be seen.\"\n\nMalawi's government ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to continue to batter the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather mid-flight and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\nFreddy reached the landlocked country early Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nIn Mozambique, at least three people died in Namacura, a town in the central Zambezia province, according to district head Moura Xavier.\n\nOne more was reported dead at the weekend, after a house collapsed in the nearby district of Zalala.\n\nThe death toll was expected to increase, as authorities worked to reach all affected areas.\n\n\"We are prioritising rescuing people and removing the lifeless bodies. We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\"\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said rains had abated on Monday but the hard-hit Mozambique coastal city of Quelimane remained without access to clean running water.\n\nFlooding affected parts of the city, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of damage,\" Taylor said by phone. \"In the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed\".\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from February 21 before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nUpon its return it carried even stronger winds and rains, Taylor said.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 97 people -- 66 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nThe last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Tropical Cyclones Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy slowed down and did not hit Quelimane until Saturday evening, using the extra day to collect more energy and water. Freddy will weaken as it moves inland, but most forecasts are that it will turn around on Tuesday at the Malawi border and move back out to sea on Wednesday, with more heavy rain in Quelimane, where the total rainfall from Freddy could exceed 350 mm. Hitting Mozambique twice and turning back out to sea both times will be unprecedented for a Mozambican cyclone.\n\nThere was major damage to trees and buildings in Quelimane and all communications were cut. Electricity supply had been shut off as a precaution. EDM spokesman Luis Amando estimated 150 posts of media tension line, four transformer posts, and 7 km of low tension lines were damaged, leaving 100,000 people without power. TVM news footage from Sunday is on https://www.facebook.com/INGD.Mocambique/videos/174482912017629\n\nBeira also had heavy rains and electricity cuts.\n\nThe chair of the National Disaster Management Institute (INGD), Luisa Meque, ordered the compulsory removal of people still living in flood-prone areas, in parts of Zambezia, Sofala and Manica provinces threatened by cyclone Freddy. The INGD sent teams to assist in the removal of people from dangerous areas, particularly near the banks of the Licungo river. \"We are focusing on compulsory removal\", said Meque. \"The greater the number of people we remove from these areas, the fewer will be the number of human victims of the cyclone\". (AIM 12 Mar)\n\nMozambique has always had disasters. In the past four decades there have been 13 droughts (secas), 27 cyclones (ciclones), 36 floods (cheias) and 29 epidemics (epidemias) according to a new report from OMR. And it shows that extreme events have increased in Mozambique since 1995, almost surely due to the climate emergency:\n\nInunda\u00e7\u00f5es em Mo\u00e7ambique: o factor humano como agravante, by Joao Mosca and Nehemias Lasse, Observat\u00f3rio do Meio Rural, Destaque Rural 209 (Portuguese only) https://omrmz.org/destaque_rural/dr-209-inundacoes-em-mocambique-o-factor-humano-como-agravante/",

                    "body": "Authorities said on Monday that Cyclone Freddy, which brought strong winds and heavy rains, killed at least 70 people in Malawi and Mozambique is on its way back to the southern African continent.\n\nAccording to the Red Cross, more than 60 bodies were discovered during the day in southern Malawi, where heavy rains caused flooding.\n\n\"Tropical Cyclone Freddy has killed 66 people in Malawi, injured 93, and left 16 people missing,\" the humanitarian organization, which is assisting with search and rescue operations, tweeted.\n\nFour more people were killed in neighboring Mozambique, according to local authorities. The damage assessment was still ongoing, with the Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD) reporting that the aftermath of the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\n\"The number of affected people exceeded the forecast,\" INGD head Luisa Meque said, adding that the storm also hit \"deemed safe\" areas.\n\nFreddy, a major cyclone on track to become the longest-lasting on record, passed through southern Africa for the second time in a few weeks over the weekend, making a comeback after a first strike in late February.\n\nIn Malawi, the city of Blantyre was severely impacted, with regional police spokeswoman Beatrice Mikuwa reporting that 36 bodies were recovered in the township of Chilobwe, \"which has been hit the most,\" with dozens of houses washed away.\n\n\"Rescue efforts are still underway, but they are hampered by the constant rain,\" Mikuwa said.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, said flash floods swept away his sister-in-family. law's\n\n\"We got a call around five a.m. from the neighbors saying that 'your relations have been washed away by the rains,'\" Duwa, a government clerk, told AFP.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have only recovered one body, a small boy, but the other four are nowhere to be found.\"\n\nMalawi's government has ordered that schools in ten southern districts remain closed until Wednesday, despite the fact that rain and winds are expected to continue to batter the country's south.\n\nMalawi Airlines has cancelled all flights to Blantyre until further notice after an inbound plane encountered bad weather mid-flight and was forced to return to the capital Lilongwe.\n\n- What is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone?\n\nFreddy arrived early Monday morning in the landlocked country after sweeping through Mozambique over the weekend.\n\nAccording to district head Moura Xavier in Mozambique, at least three people died in Namacura, a town in the central Zambezia province.\n\nAnother person was killed over the weekend when a house in the nearby Zalala district collapsed.\n\nAs authorities worked to reach all affected areas, the death toll was expected to rise.\n\n\"We are prioritizing the rescue of people and the removal of lifeless bodies. We don't have any figures, \"Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia, agreed.\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we're providing, and we'll keep working.\"\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the United Nations Children's Fund, said rains had stopped on Monday, but the hard-hit Mozambique coastal city of Quelimane remained without clean running water.\n\n\"There's a lot of damage,\" Taylor explained over the phone. \"In the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed\".\n\nFreddy, which formed off the coast of northwestern Australia in the first week of February, was on track to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, according to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nIt ripped across the southern Indian Ocean, blasting Madagascar from February 21 to February 24, before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFreddy then returned to Madagascar before heading back to Mozambique, following what meteorologists call a \"rare\" loop trajectory.",

Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report.\n\nRead | Mauritius halts flights, shuts stock exchange as cyclone Freddy approaches\n\nA three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nRead | Cyclone Gabrielle death toll rises to five as recovery under way in New Zealand\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring centre in Reunion warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on.\n\nMozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"",

                    "body": "Affected countries include Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar.\n\nMozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 60 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummeled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's main commercial hub of Blantyre, the central hospital had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nCasualties were still arriving from affected areas, said Chipiliro Khamula, spokesperson for the department of disaster management.\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in the country's second-largest city Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique's Quelimane, which was struck hard by the storm, authorities told the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nScores more were injured, Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on Radio Mozambique.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UN children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could now get worse. Scientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates, heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A 3-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.",

                    "body": "An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.Local police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.The deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.The cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.Freddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.Freddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.French weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.Much of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"Freddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.",

                    "body": "Blantyre: Mozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 60 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's main commercial hub of Blantyre, the central hospital had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nCasualties were still arriving from affected areas, said Chipiliro Khamula, spokesperson for the department of disaster management.\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in the country's second-largest city Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique's Quelimane, which was struck hard by the storm, authorities told the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nScores more people were injured, Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on Radio Mozambique.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy, packing powerful winds and torrential rain, killed at least 70 people in Malawi and Mozambique on its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday.\n\nMore than 60 bodies were found during the day in southern Malawi where heavy downpours triggered flooding, according to the Red Cross.\n\n\"Sixty-six people have died in Malawi, 93 injured and 16 people are missing due to Tropical Cyclone Freddy,\" tweeted the humanitarian organisation, which is helping with search and rescue operations.\n\nFour more died in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said.\n\nAn assessment of the damage was still underway, with the Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD) saying the fallout from the storm's second landfall in the country was worse than expected.\n\n\"The number of affected people was above the forecast,\" INGD head Luisa Meque said, adding the storm struck also areas that had been \"deemed safe\".\n\nFreddy, a major cyclone on track to become the longest-lasting on record, barrelled through southern Africa at the weekend for the second time within a few weeks, making a comeback after a first hit in late February.\n\nIn Malawi, Blantyre city was badly impacted, with regional police spokeswoman Beatrice Mikuwa saying 36 bodies were recovered in the township of Chilobwe \"which has been hit the most\", with dozens of houses washed away.\n\n\"Rescue efforts are still underway but they are being hampered by the incessant rains,\" said Mikuwa.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, said his sister-in-law's family was swept away by flash floods.\n\n\"We got a call from the neighbours at around five am to say that 'your relations have been washed away by the rains',\" Duwa, a government clerk, told AFP.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have just recovered one body, a small boy, but the remaining four are not to be seen.\"\n\nMalawi's government ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to continue to batter the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather mid-flight and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\n- Longest-lasting tropical cyclone? -\n\nFreddy reached the landlocked country early Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nIn Mozambique, at least three people died in Namacura, a town in the central Zambezia province, according to district head Moura Xavier.\n\nOne more was reported dead at the weekend, after a house collapsed in the nearby district of Zalala.\n\nThe death toll was expected to increase, as authorities worked to reach all affected areas.\n\n\"We are prioritising rescuing people and removing the lifeless bodies. We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\"\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said rains had abated on Monday but the hard-hit Mozambique coastal city of Quelimane remained without access to clean running water.\n\nFlooding affected parts of the city, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of damage,\" Taylor said by phone. \"In the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed\".\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and blasted Madagascar from February 21 before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nUpon its return it carried even stronger winds and rains, Taylor said.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 97 people -- 66 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nThe last cyclones to cross the entire southern Indian Ocean were Tropical Cyclones Leon-Eline and Hudah in 2000.",

At least 6 casualties fell in the Mozambican coastal town of Quelimane, while in Malawi casualties were reported in the townships of Chilobwe and Ndirande in Blantyre, Malawi's second city. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had warned that cyclone Freddy was expected to make landfall near Quelimane in Mozambique's Zambezia province and warned for flooding in Zambezia and Nampula provinces. The town of Quelimane went into lockdown in advance of the storm.\n\nLast month, more than 171,000 people were affected by the storm following its first landfall, when 27 people were reported to have been killed in Madagascar and Mozambique. In Mozambique, the provinces of Sofala, Gaza and Inhambane were recovering after they had experienced flooding following Freddy's first landfall. In Madagascar, Freddy made landfall near Manajary, which has already been affected by cyclones Batsirai and Emnati in February 2022 and cyclone Cheneso in January 2023.",

It has caused a lot of havoc. In Blantyre alone, which is the commercial capital of Malawi in the southern region, this morning as of 7:00 a.m. (1:00 a.m. ET), we got reports of 11 confirmed deaths with 16 people missing, most of whom have been carried away by running waters, and several others have been injured,\" he added.\n\nKalaya warned the numbers of dead and missing could rise due to the heavy rains and strong winds.\n\nSchools will remain shut in 10 of the worst affected districts until Wednesday, Malawi's education ministry said in a statement.\n\nKalaya said the destruction caused by the storm had inundated roadways and triggered blackouts in Malawi's worst affected areas, making rescue efforts difficult.\n\n\"They [rescue teams] are trying their best to provide the help they can. Where they can move around, they are moving around. Because the rains are still falling, rescue efforts are affected in different locations,\" he told CNN.\n\nThe deadly Cyclone Freddy has broken records for the longest-lasting storm of its kind and has struck neighboring Mozambique and also Madagascar, killing a total of more than 20 people and displacing thousands of others across both countries.\n\nIt has been described as a \"very rare\" storm by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which called its journey so far \"incredible and dangerous.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

                    "body": "An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck southern Africa for a second time Saturday night, authorities in the two countries have confirmed.\n\n\u00a9 (Uncredited / Associated Press) An uprooted tree lies across a street in Quelimane, Mozambique, after Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall Saturday night. (Associated Press)\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe, in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country, have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nLoad Error\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include those of five members of a single family in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A 3-year-old girl who was trapped in the debris is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices, which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the Associated Press.\n\nThe cyclone lashed Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy has recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The United Nations' weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record of 31 days set by Hurricane John in 1994.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday, where there are reports of damage to houses and farmland, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy churns on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is to homes built in areas where they're prohibited by law, such as in mountainous regions or near rivers. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected to weaken and to exit back to sea Wednesday, according to Meteo-France.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "CNN --\n\nAt least 11 people were confirmed dead on Monday after a deadly tropical storm slammed into southern Malawi, leaving many injured and unaccounted for, local authorities told CNN.\n\n\"The whole of southern Malawi is under the influence of Cyclone Freddy,\" Malawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya said.\n\n\"We started feeling the impact of the cyclone on Friday. It has caused a lot of havoc. In Blantyre alone, which is the commercial capital of Malawi in the southern region, this morning as of 7:00 a.m. (1:00 a.m. ET), we got reports of 11 confirmed deaths with 16 people missing, most of whom have been carried away by running waters, and several others have been injured,\" he added.\n\nKalaya warned the numbers of dead and missing could rise due to the heavy rains and strong winds.\n\nSchools will remain shut in 10 of the worst affected districts until Wednesday, Malawi's education ministry said in a statement.\n\nKalaya said the destruction caused by the storm had inundated roadways and triggered blackouts in Malawi's worst affected areas, making rescue efforts difficult.\n\n\"They [rescue teams] are trying their best to provide the help they can. Where they can move around, they are moving around. Because the rains are still falling, rescue efforts are affected in different locations,\" he told CNN.\n\nA tree lies across a street in Quelimane, Mozambique Sunday, March 12, 2023. AP\n\nThe deadly Cyclone Freddy has broken records for the longest-lasting storm of its kind and has struck neighboring Mozambique and also Madagascar, killing a total of more than 20 people and displacing thousands of others across both countries.\n\nIt has been described as a \"very rare\" storm by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which called its journey so far \"incredible and dangerous.\"",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the centre of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people have been killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummelling the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring centre in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected to weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.",

                    "body": "An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.Local police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured.\n\nAn unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was ''trapped in the debris'' is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring centre in Reunion warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\" Freddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to Meteo-France.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\n___\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.\n\n(Additional reporting by Carien du Plessis and Tim Cocks in Johannesburg; Writing by Alexander Winning and Nellie Peyton;Editing by Tim Cocks, Sharon Singleton and Nick Macfie)\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nAn unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nTROPICAL CYCLONE FREDDY DROPS DANGEROUS RAINFALL OVER MOZAMBIQUE\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\n2 WEEKS AFTER TROPICAL CYCLONE CHENESO KILLS 30 IN MADAGASCAR, THE COUNTRY BRACES FOR CYCLONE FREDDY\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the centre of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy lashed Malawi early Monday morning after making landfall for a second time in a month in Mozambique on Sunday, killing at least 60 people in both countries.\n\nFreddy made landfall with sustained winds of nearly 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour), causing \"severe damage and cutting off children and families from critical services,\" UNICEF, which provides rapid response to disaster-struck areas, said in a statement.\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane in Mozambique Sunday, the storm continued inland towards the southern tip of neighboring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nDestructive winds and heavy rainfall brought down trees and damaged rooftops in both countries, with Malawi having borne the brunt of the inexhaustible storm.\n\nMalawian police officials said on Monday at least 51 people died in the country, while the Malawi Red Cross Society said at least 66 had been killed in the storm.\n\nAt least 36 people died in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country.\n\nAt least five people have died in Mozambique since Saturday, local authorities said. An assessment of the damage was underway, officials added.\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in Mozambique were cut over the weekend so the extent of damage was not immediately clear. But electricity has been restored in most areas as of Monday afternoon, the national power company said.\n\nFreddy first wrecked havoc last month, having killed at least 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the storm and more than half a million were at risk in Mozambique this time, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned.\n\nThe storm, which originated in the Indian Ocean in early February became the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization.",

We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\"\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 42 people -- 11 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.",

UNICEF Mozambique/2023/Alfredo Zuniga/Handout via REUTERS\n\nBLANTYRE, Malawi/MAPUTO (Reuters) -Mozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 60 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's main commercial hub of Blantyre, the central hospital had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.\n\nThe injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. \"A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.\"\n\nCasualties were still arriving from affected areas, said Chipiliro Khamula, spokesperson for the department of disaster management.\n\nPolice spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in the country's second-largest city Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique's Quelimane, which was struck hard by the storm, authorities told the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nScores more people were injured, Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on Radio Mozambique.\n\n\"The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.\n\n(Additional reporting by Carien du Plessis and Tim Cocks in Johannesburg; Writing by Alexander Winning and Nellie Peyton;Editing by Tim Cocks, Sharon Singleton and Nick Macfie)",

We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,\" he said from a hospital in Quelimane.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now nearing 100.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nThe wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nLocal police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique. Kabukuru reported from Mombasa, Kenya.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations. See more about AP's climate initiative here.

                    "body": "Dhaka airport to introduce APIS preventing aerial movement of int'l offenders\n\nAn unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.",

                    "body": "Police in Malawi said 11 people died in areas surrounding the southern city of Blantyre, where heavy rains triggered flooding as the cyclone made a comeback, just weeks after it first struck the continent\n\nBlantyre. Fifteen people have died in Malawi and Mozambique as Cyclone Freddy hit the two countries with torrential rains and strong winds upon its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday.\n\nPolice in Malawi said 11 people died in areas surrounding the southern city of Blantyre, where heavy rains triggered flooding as the cyclone made a comeback, just weeks after it first struck the continent.\n\nAt least 16 more people were missing and four injured, according to a preliminary count, police said.\n\nFour more people died in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said, as an assessment of the damage was underway after the storm made its second landfall in the country on Saturday.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, said his sister in law's family was swept away by flash floods in Chilobwe, a township south of Blantyre.\n\n\"We got a call from the neighbours at around five am to say that 'your relations have been washed away by the rains',\" Duwa, a government clerk told AFP.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have just recovered one body, a small boy, but the remaining four are not to be seen.\"\n\nEarlier police said they found the body of a three-year-old girl after a water stream breached its banks washing away houses built along its course.\n\nMalawi's government ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to continue to batter the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather mid-flight and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\n\"It was thought wise to return to Lilongwe,\" said Malawi Airlines spokesman Only Taulo.\n\nLongest-lasting tropical cyclone?\n\nFreddy reached the landlocked country early Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nIn Mozambique, at least three people died in Namacura, a town in the central Zambezia province, according to district head Moura Xavier.\n\nOne more was reported dead at the weekend, after a house collapsed in the nearby district of Zalala.\n\nThe death toll was expected to increase, as authorities worked to reach all affected areas.\n\n\"We are experiencing communication difficulties and this situation does not allow us to have reliable tolls,\" said Health Minister Armindo Tiago.\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said rains had abated on Monday but the hard-hit coastal city of Quelimane remained without access to clean running water.\n\nFlooding affected parts of the city, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of damage,\" Taylor said by phone. \"In the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed\".\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and barrelled through Madagascar from February 21, crossing the island before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nDuring its first deadly visit to the country it affected about 166,000 people.\n\nUpon its return it carried even stronger winds and rains, Taylor said.\n\n\"We are prioritising rescuing people and removing the lifeless bodies. We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\"\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 42 people -- 11 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.",

                    "body": "Freddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAn unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\n'Heaviest rains'\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring centre in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks.\n\nThe cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected to weaken and exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to Meteo-France.",

                    "body": "Fifteen people have died in Malawi and Mozambique as Cyclone Freddy hit the two countries with torrential rains and strong winds upon its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday.\n\nPolice in Malawi said 11 people died in areas surrounding the southern city of Blantyre, where heavy rains triggered flooding as the cyclone made a comeback, just weeks after it first struck the continent.\n\nAt least 16 more people were missing and four injured, according to a preliminary count, police said.\n\nFour more people died in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said, as an assessment of the damage was underway after the storm made its second landfall in the country on Saturday.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, said his sister in law's family was swept away by flash floods in Chilobwe, a township south of Blantyre.\n\n\"We got a call from the neighbours at around five am to say that 'your relations have been washed away by the rains',\" Duwa, a government clerk told AFP.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have just recovered one body, a small boy, but the remaining four are not to be seen.\"\n\nEarlier police said they found the body of a three-year-old girl after a water stream breached its banks washing away houses built along its course.\n\nMalawi's government ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to continue to batter the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather mid-flight and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\n\"It was thought wise to return to Lilongwe,\" said Malawi Airlines spokesman Only Taulo.\n\nFreddy reached the landlocked country early Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nIn Mozambique, at least three people died in Namacura, a town in the central Zambezia province, according to district head Moura Xavier.\n\nOne more was reported dead at the weekend, after a house collapsed in the nearby district of Zalala.\n\nThe death toll was expected to increase, as authorities worked to reach all affected areas.\n\n\"We are experiencing communication difficulties and this situation does not allow us to have reliable tolls,\" said Health Minister Armindo Tiago.\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said rains had abated on Monday but the hard-hit coastal city of Quelimane remained without access to clean running water.\n\nFlooding affected parts of the city, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of damage,\" Taylor said by phone. \"In the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed\".\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and barrelled through Madagascar from February 21, crossing the island before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nDuring its first deadly visit to the country it affected about 166,000 people.\n\nUpon its return it carried even stronger winds and rains, Taylor said.\n\n\"We are prioritising rescuing people and removing the lifeless bodies. We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\"\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 42 people -- 11 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.",

                    "body": "Eleven people have died and sixteen are missing around Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre after tropical storm Freddy brought torrential rains that triggered floods and landslides, police said on Monday.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, Freddy, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, is also believed to be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994.\n\nIt battered Mozambique as a cyclone for the second time in a month over the weekend before weakening as it moved inland towards Malawi.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique is unknown because power and phone signals have been cut off in the affected area.\n\nMalawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya said that the number of people killed and missing because of Freddy was likely to grow as it had affected 10 districts and so far numbers were only in for Blantyre.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and most residents were without power.\n\nOne person was killed in the port of Quelimane when their house collapsed, according to Mozambique's official broadcaster TVM, bringing the total number of fatalities in Mozambique and Madagascar since Freddy's first landfall last month to at least 28.\n\nThere have been worries that Freddy could cause rivers to burst in its course because Mozambique has experienced more rain than it does in a year in the last four weeks.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) - An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre\u00b4s Ndirande township after Freddy\u00b4s destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It\u00b4s the second time the record-breaking cyclone - which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February - made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nA tree lays across a street in Quelimane, Mozambique Sunday, March 12, 2023.

The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique\u00b4s central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique. Kabukuru reported from Mombasa, Kenya.\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations. See more about AP\u00b4s climate initiative here.

                    "body": "Tropical Cyclone (TC) Freddy was one of the longest-lasting systems in the southern hemisphere. Freddy developed off the coast of Indonesia in early February and crossed the south Indian Ocean until it reached the areas around Mauritius and La Reunion. During its trajectory, TC Freddy reached the equivalent of a Category 5 Hurricane and was the first cyclone to reach this intensity in 2023.\n\nAfter bringing intense rains and winds to the islands of Mauritius and La Reunion, TC Freddy made landfall on the eastern coast of Madagascar on 21 February 2023, at around 7 pm (local time). TC Freddy weakened from a category 4 cyclone into a category 3 ahead of landfall but hit Madagascar with sustained winds of 150 km/h. It made landfall just north of Manajary, and area that was hit and impacted by two tropical cyclones in Feb 2022 (Batsirai and Emnati) and by Cyclone Cheneso only a few weeks before (Jan 2023).\n\nIn anticipation of the landfall, the Government of Madagascar put seven (7) areas of the country into red alerts and 4 in yellow. In collaboration with Red Cross and other partners, it also evacuated thousands of vulnerable people from the coastal area, limiting the potential loss of life. As TC Freddy crossed Madagascar, it brought upon heavy rains and strong winds leading to flooding and widespread damage to houses and public infrastructure. TC Freddy exited Madagascar in the western coast, made its way across the Mozambique channel and reached Mozambique on 24 February as a Tropical Storm.",

                    "body": "Blantyre (Malawi), Mar 13 (AP) An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nAlso Read | When Is Ramadan 2023 Moon Sighting in Saudi Arabia, UAE? Know Tentative Dates for Ramzan and First Day of Fasting.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: Non-Bailable Arrest Warrants Issued Against Former PM Imran Khan in Toshakhana Case and for Threatening Woman Judge.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummelled the island states of Madagascar and Reunion as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical US hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and travelled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The UN's weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear.\n\nTelecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring centre in Reunion warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on.\n\nMozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to Meteo-France.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi - Mozambique and Malawi were on Monday counting the cost of tropical storm Freddy, which ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend, leaving a trail of destruction and killing at least 17 people.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's second-largest city, Blantyre, at least 11 people were killed and 16 are missing, police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters, adding that those numbers were likely to rise as so far casualties were only recorded for Blantyre and the storm had affected 10 districts.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday, and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique port Quelimane, which was right in the eye of the storm, authorities announced on the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UN children's agency Unicef in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies in Mozambique did not currently have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nHe said the wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of water-borne diseases.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, prompting concern that rivers could burst their banks and cause wide-scale flooding.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could worsen because of Freddy's heavy rains.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.\n\n-IOL",

                    "body": "Fifteen people have died in Malawi and Mozambique as Cyclone Freddy hit the two countries with torrential rains and strong winds upon its return to southern Africa's mainland, authorities said Monday.\n\nPolice in Malawi said 11 people died in areas surrounding the southern city of Blantyre, where heavy rains triggered flooding as the cyclone made a comeback, just weeks after it first struck the continent.\n\nAt least 16 more people were missing and four injured, according to a preliminary count, police said.\n\nFour more people died in neighbouring Mozambique, local authorities said, as an assessment of the damage was underway after the storm made its second landfall in the country on Saturday.\n\nRichard Duwa, 38, said his sister in law's family was swept away by flash floods in Chilobwe, a township south of Blantyre.\n\n\"We got a call from the neighbours at around five am to say that 'your relations have been washed away by the rains',\" Duwa, a government clerk told AFP.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have just recovered one body, a small boy, but the remaining four are not to be seen.\"\n\nEarlier police said they found the body of a three-year-old girl after a water stream breached its banks washing away houses built along its course.\n\nMalawi's government ordered schools in ten southern districts to remain closed until Wednesday, with rains and winds expected to continue to batter the nation's south.\n\nNational carrier Malawi Airlines said all flights to Blantyre have been cancelled until further notice after an inbound plane ran into the bad weather mid-flight and was forced back to the capital Lilongwe.\n\n\"It was thought wise to return to Lilongwe,\" said Malawi Airlines spokesman Only Taulo.\n\n- Longest-lasting tropical cyclone? -\n\nFreddy reached the landlocked country early Monday morning after sweeping through Mozambique at the weekend.\n\nIn Mozambique, at least three people died in Namacura, a town in the central Zambezia province, according to district head Moura Xavier.\n\nOne more was reported dead at the weekend, after a house collapsed in the nearby district of Zalala.\n\nThe death toll was expected to increase, as authorities worked to reach all affected areas.\n\n\"We are experiencing communication difficulties and this situation does not allow us to have reliable tolls,\" said Health Minister Armindo Tiago.\n\nGuy Taylor, a spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said rains had abated on Monday but the hard-hit coastal city of Quelimane remained without access to clean running water.\n\nFlooding affected parts of the city, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of damage,\" Taylor said by phone. \"In the more rural areas, many houses are completely destroyed\".\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off north-western Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and barrelled through Madagascar from February 21, crossing the island before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nDuring its first deadly visit to the country it affected about 166,000 people.\n\nUpon its return it carried even stronger winds and rains, Taylor said.\n\n\"We are prioritising rescuing people and removing the lifeless bodies. We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\n\"The most important thing is the assistance we are providing and we will continue to work.\"\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 42 people -- 11 in Malawi, 14 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE - An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\n___\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

                    "body": "At least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\n___\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique. Kabukuru reported from Mombasa, Kenya.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations. See more about AP's climate initiative here.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\n___\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique. Kabukuru reported from Mombasa, Kenya.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations. See more about AP's climate initiative here.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique. Kabukuru reported from Mombasa, Kenya.\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations. See more about AP's climate initiative here.

                    "body": "Freddy is one of strongest storms ever recorded in southern hemisphere and could be longest-lasting tropical cyclone\n\nMozambique and Malawi were on Monday counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend, leaving a trail of destruction and killing at least 17 people.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre, at least 11 people were killed and 16 are missing, police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters, adding that those numbers were likely to rise as so far casualties were only in for Blantyre and the storm had affected 10 districts.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique port Quelimane, which was right in the eye of the storm, authorities announced on the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now at least 44.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for United Nations children's agency Unicef in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies in Mozambique did not currently have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nHe said the wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, prompting concern that rivers could burst their banks and cause wide-scale flooding.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could worsen because of Freddy's heavy rains. Scientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere. - Reuters",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique. Kabukuru reported from Mombasa, Kenya.\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations. See more about AP's climate initiative here.

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) -- An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 44 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.\n\nAt least 39 people in Malawi's commercial hub of Blantyre have died with several others missing or injured, the city's chief executive officer told The Associated Press on Monday. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.\n\nThe deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre's Ndirande township after Freddy's destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was \"trapped in the debris\" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.\n\n\"We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,\" Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.\n\nThe cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It's the second time the record-breaking cyclone -- which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February -- made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and R\u00e9union as it traversed across the ocean.\n\nThe cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.\n\nFreddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. Its set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.\n\nFreddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in R\u00e9union warned Monday that \"the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours\" as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique's central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to \"floods and landslides in mountainous areas\" by weather monitors.\n\nMuch of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nFreddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.\n\n___\n\nAlexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

We don't have numbers,\" said Andre Tazingua, a fire service commander in Zambezia.\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off northwestern Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.",

                    "body": "Mozambique and Malawi were on Monday counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend, leaving a trail of destruction and killing at least 17 people.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre, at least 11 people were killed and 16 are missing, police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters, adding that those numbers were likely to rise as so far casualties were only in for Blantyre and the storm had affected 10 districts.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique port Quelimane, which was right in the eye of the storm, authorities announced on the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now at least 44.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for United Nations children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies in Mozambique did not currently have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nHe said the wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, prompting concern that rivers could burst their banks and cause widescale flooding.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could worsen because of Freddy's heavy rains.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "Mozambique and Malawi were on Monday counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend, leaving a trail of destruction and killing at least 17 people.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre, at least 11 people were killed and 16 are missing, police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters, adding that those numbers were likely to rise as so far casualties were only in for Blantyre and the storm had affected 10 districts.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique port Quelimane, which was right in the eye of the storm, authorities announced on the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now at least 44.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for United Nations children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies in Mozambique did not currently have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nHe said the wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases.",

                    "body": "The full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in the affected area. Mozambique and Malawi were on Monday counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend, leaving a trail of destruction and killing at least 17 people.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre, at least 11 people were killed and 16 are missing, police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters, adding that those numbers were likely to rise as so far casualties were only in for Blantyre and the storm had affected 10 districts.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique port Quelimane, which was right in the eye of the storm, authorities announced on the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now at least 44.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for United Nations children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies in Mozambique did not currently have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nHe said the wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, prompting concern that rivers could burst their banks and cause widescale flooding.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could worsen because of Freddy's heavy rains. Scientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nHe said the wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, prompting concern that rivers could burst their banks and cause widescale flooding.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could worsen because of Freddy's heavy rains.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.\n\n(Reporting by Frank Phiri in Blantyre, Carien du Plessis in Johannesburg and Manuel Mucari in Maputo; Writing by Alexander Winning; Editing by Tim Cocks and Sharon Singleton)\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "BLANTYRE, Malawi, March 13 (Reuters) - Mozambique and Malawi were on Monday counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend, leaving a trail of destruction and killing at least 17 people.\n\nFreddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.\n\nIn Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre, at least 11 people were killed and 16 are missing, police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters, adding that those numbers were likely to rise as so far casualties were only in for Blantyre and the storm had affected 10 districts.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,\" Kalaya said.\n\nAt least six people died in Mozambique port Quelimane, which was right in the eye of the storm, authorities announced on the public broadcaster on Monday.\n\nThe total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now at least 44.\n\nGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for United Nations children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies in Mozambique did not currently have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\n\n\"We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\" he said.\n\nHe said the wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases.\n\nMozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, prompting concern that rivers could burst their banks and cause widescale flooding.\n\nMalawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could worsen because of Freddy's heavy rains.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.\n\nBy Frank Phiri\n\n(Reporting by Frank Phiri in Blantyre, Carien du Plessis in Johannesburg and Manuel Mucari in Maputo; Writing by Alexander Winning; Editing by Tim Cocks and Sharon Singleton)",

                    "body": "Tropical cyclone Freddy killed at least one person and displaced dozens of others on Saturday night as it returned to Mozambique, according to an initial report from local authorities on Sunday.\n\nFreddy had already killed 10 people in the southern African country during its first passage at the end of February, and 17 in total in Madagascar where it also hit twice, describing a looping trajectory rarely recorded by meteorologists.\n\n\"One death has been reported\", an elderly person who died when his house collapsed on Saturday, Pio Tameliwa, head of the Zalala district in the central province of Zambezia, which is open to the Mozambique Channel and where the cyclone made landfall with winds averaging 150 km/h, told AFP. More than 70 people were displaced in the area.\n\n\"These are only the first reports\", said Tameliwa, as the authorities are having difficulties in making a complete assessment of the situation because of the telecommunications cut off by the storm.\n\nMore than 100,000 users are without power, according to the public electricity company. A school in the region was completely destroyed.\n\nAccording to NGOs on the ground, the cyclone caused severe destruction and damaged many houses, especially in the Quelimane area. \"The town is without electricity, water and cell phone coverage,\" said Guy Taylor, a spokesman for UNICEF.\n\nIn Beira, in the neighboring coastal province, \"the rains are intense (...) and there is a risk of flooding,\" warned Alcidio Benjamim Pangaia of the NGO ForAfrika.\n\nFreddy should leave Mozambique during the week and weaken, according to forecasts.\n\nIf it has already descended to the stage of a tropical storm, it is still causing waves of up to 8 meters and heavy rains, according to the National Institute of Meteorology of Mozambique (Inam).\n\nThe phenomenon, atypical, is about to be classified the longest cyclone ever recorded.\n\nFreddy, which formed off the coast of Australia reaching the stage of a storm on February 6, has been raging in the Indian Ocean for 34 days.\n\n\"Its very long life is explained by its trajectory from east to west that has never allowed him to evacuate to the southern latitudes, where low pressure systems lose their tropical characteristics,\" explained to AFP Emmanuel Cloppet, director of Meteo-France for the Indian Ocean.",

                    "body": "At least 11 people have died and 16 are missing around Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre after tropical storm Freddy brought torrential rains that triggered floods and landslides.\n\nFreddy, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, is believed to also be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt pummelled Mozambique for the second time in a month as a cyclone at the weekend before weakening as it moved inland towards Malawi.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in the affected area.\n\nMalawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters that the number of people killed and missing because of Freddy was likely to grow as it had affected 10 districts and so far numbers were only in for Blantyre.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and most residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble and our team is working with other co-operating national agencies,\" Kalaya said.\n\nMozambique's public broadcaster TVM reported that one person was killed near the port of Quelimane when their house collapsed, bringing the number killed to at least 28 in Mozambique and Madagascar since Freddy first made landfall last month.\n\nMozambique has received more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, and there has been concern that Freddy could cause rivers to burst in its path.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm sea water evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "MOMBASA, Kenya -- Record-breaking Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique Saturday night, pounding the southern African nation with heavy rains and disrupting transport and telecommunications services.\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France warned of \"destructive and devastating\" winds and \"dangerous seas and heavy rains\" that could lead to landslides. It said Freddy would go farther inland through the weekend, generating heavy rains in Mozambique and southern Malawi, with rain also likely in Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\nIt's the second time Freddy has hit the country, with the cyclone originally making landfall late last month.\n\nMeteo-France also raised concerns that Freddy is unlikely to weaken over land in the coming week and has a high probability of exiting back into the sea. Freddy made landfall with maximum wind speeds at sea measuring around 100 miles per hour and sea gusts averaging around 140 miles per hour, the agency said.\n\nFreddy was initially on course to make landfall in the country Friday night but stalled over the Mozambique channel. The cyclone then intensified on Saturday and regained strength as it barrelled toward land, Mozambique's National Institute of Meteorology said.\n\nThe cyclone's second punch is showering a low-lying, vast land teeming with rivers and \"almost all of them have no dam\" to ease flooding, said Salomao Bandeira, a scientist at Mozambique's Universidade Eduardo Mondlane. Flooding in the country earlier this year slammed regions where major rivers are controlled by dams, allowing some degree of control, Bandeira said, raising fears this hit could lead to more destruction.\n\nThe projected deluge is already worrying health and disaster agencies in both Mozambique and Malawi, who have recently been battling cholera cases and other water-borne ailments. The U.N. and EU-led disaster alert system has already issued a red alert projecting that some 2.3 million people will be impacted. Mozambique's disaster institute has moved thousands of people to storm shelters in anticipation.\n\n\"More lives are being saved in Mozambique today\" due to early preparedness, Bandeira said.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, Malawi Red Cross said it had activated its early response teams in southern Malawi to prepare for the cyclone.\n\nEarlier in the week, Freddy's longevity and baffling trajectories caused the U.N. weather agency to set up a committee to determine whether it has broken the record as the longest-lasting tropical cyclone in recorded history after traversing more than 5,000 miles in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Freddy has already catapulted into the record books for the second-ever highest accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, a measurement of a cyclone's energy over time.\n\nFreddy is also the third storm on record to last more than 22 days, said NOAA's Carl Schreck. Hurricane John in 1994 and an unnamed Atlantic hurricane in 1899 are the other two. The natural weather event La Nina and a negative Indian Ocean Dipole, or a change of temperatures over the ocean, \"may have produced ocean temperatures and atmospheric circulations that made an event like this more likely,\" Schreck added.\n\nAny storm that can remain at such a \"strong intensity for so long and make two landfalls is important in terms of human impacts and in terms of science,\" said Kristen Corbosiero, professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany.\n\n\"Intense storms generally go through a series of eyewall replacement cycles and intensity fluctuations,\" where the cyclone begins to develop a new eye, Corbosiero said. \"But Freddy didn't have these cycles for most of its life cycle. Trying to understand why, will be a good research topic.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Seth Borenstein of The Associated Press.\n\nTrees are strewn across a street in Quelimane, Mozambique, Saturday, March 11, 2023. Record breaking Cyclone Freddy, will make its second landfall in Mozambique on Sunday morning as an \"intense tropical cyclone.\" (AP Photo)",

At least 11 people have died and 16 are missing around Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre after tropical storm Freddy brought torrential rains that triggered floods and landslides, police said on Monday.\n\nFreddy, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, is believed to also be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled Mozambique for the second time in a month as a cyclone over the weekend before weakening as it moved inland towards Malawi.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in the affected area.\n\nMalawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters that the number of people killed and missing because of Freddy was likely to grow as it had affected 10 districts and so far numbers were only in for Blantyre.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and most residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble and our team is working with other cooperating national agencies,\" Kalaya said.\n\nMozambique's public broadcaster TVM reported that one person was killed near the port of Quelimane when their house collapsed, bringing the number killed to at least 28 in Mozambique and Madagascar since Freddy first made landfall last month.\n\nMozambique has received more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, and there has been concern that Freddy could cause rivers to burst in its path.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "At least 11 people have died and 16 are missing around Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre after tropical storm Freddy brought torrential rains that triggered floods and landslides.\n\nFreddy, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, is believed to also be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt pummelled Mozambique for the second time in a month as a cyclone at the weekend before weakening as it moved inland towards Malawi.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in the affected area.\n\nMalawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters that the number of people killed and missing because of Freddy was likely to grow as it had affected 10 districts and so far numbers were only in for Blantyre.\n\nHe said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and most residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble and our team is working with other cooperating national agencies,\" Kalaya said.\n\nMozambique's public broadcaster TVM reported that one person was killed near the port of Quelimane when their house collapsed, bringing the number killed to at least 28 in Mozambique and Madagascar since Freddy first made landfall last month.\n\nMozambique has received more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, and there has been concern that Freddy could cause rivers to burst in its path.\n\nScientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

                    "body": "At least 11 people have died and 16 are missing around Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre after tropical storm Freddy brought torrential rains that triggered floods and landslides, police said on Monday.\n\nAt least 11 people have died and 16 are missing around Malawi's second-largest city Blantyre after tropical storm Freddy brought torrential rains that triggered floods and landslides, police said on Monday. Freddy, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, is believed to also be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt pummelled Mozambique for the second time in a month as a cyclone over the weekend before weakening as it moved inland towards Malawi. The full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in the affected area.\n\nMalawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters that the number of people killed and missing because of Freddy was likely to grow as it had affected 10 districts and so far numbers were only in for Blantyre. He said rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst affected townships in Blantyre, where it was still raining on Monday and most residents were without power.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble and our team is working with other cooperating national agencies,\" Kalaya said. Mozambique's public broadcaster TVM reported that one person was killed near the port of Quelimane when their house collapsed, bringing the number killed to at least 28 in Mozambique and Madagascar since Freddy first made landfall last month.\n\nMozambique has received more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks, and there has been concern that Freddy could cause rivers to burst in its path. Scientists say climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

It struck central Mozambique as a cyclone on Sunday before moving inland and hitting Malawi overnight with torrential rains and strong winds.\n\nMalawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst affected townships in Blantyre.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble and our team is working with other cooperating national agencies,\" he said.",

It struck central Mozambique as a cyclone on Sunday before moving inland and hitting Malawi overnight with torrential rains and strong winds.\n\nMalawi police spokesman Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams were looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst affected townships in Blantyre.\n\n\"Some missing people are feared buried in rubble and our team is working with other cooperating national agencies,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Frank Phiri Writing by Alexander Winning Editing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and Estelle Shirbon)",

Everything is closed. We're locked up,\" resident Vania Massingue said by telephone from her house in the port settlement of Quelimane, located in the storm's path in the central Zambezia province.\n\n\"I can see some houses with roofs torn apart, broken windows and the streets flooded. It's really scary.\"",

According to the World Meteorological Organization, the previous record was held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994.\n\nState channel TVM reported that the power utility had switched off the electricity completely as a precaution, and that all flights were suspended.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe cyclone is slow-moving, which meteorological experts say means it will pick up more moisture off the sea, bringing heavy rainfall.",

                    "body": "Record-breaking Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique, pounding the southern African nation with heavy rains and disrupting transport and telecommunications services.French weather agency Mto-France warned of destructive and devastating winds and dangerous seas and heavy rains that could lead to landslides.\n\nRecord-breaking Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique, pounding the southern African nation with heavy rains and disrupting transport and telecommunications services.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France warned of \"destructive and devastating\" winds and \"dangerous seas and heavy rains'' that could lead to landslides. It said Freddy will go further inland through the weekend, generating heavy rains in Mozambique and southern Malawi, with rain also likely in Zimbabwe and Zambia. Its the second time Freddy has hit the country, with the cyclone originally making landfall late last month. M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France also raised concerns that Freddy is unlikely to weaken over land in the coming week and has a high probability of exiting back into the sea. Freddy made landfall with maximum wind speeds at sea measuring 155 kilometers (around 100 miles) an hour and sea gusts averaging 220 kilometers (around 140 miles) an hour, the agency said.\n\nFreddy was initially on course to make landfall in the country Friday night but stalled over the Mozambique channel. The cyclone then intensified on Saturday and regained strength as it barreled toward land, Mozambique's National Institute of Meteorology said.\n\nThe cyclone's second punch was showering a low-lying, vast land teeming with rivers and \"almost all of them have no dam\" to ease flooding, said Salomao Bandeira, a scientist at Mozambique's Universidade Eduardo Mondlane. Flooding in the country earlier this year slammed regions where major rivers are controlled by dams, allowing some degree of control, Bandeira said, raising fears this hit could lead to more destruction.\n\nThe projected deluge is already worrying health and disaster agencies in both Mozambique and Malawi, who have recently been battling cholera cases and other water-borne ailments. The UN and EU-led disaster alert system has already issued a red alert projecting that some 2.3 million people will be impacted. Mozambique's disaster institute has moved thousands of people to storm shelters in anticipation. \"More lives are being saved in Mozambique today\" due to early preparedness, Bandeira said. In a statement released on Saturday, Malawi Red Cross said it had activated its early response teams in southern Malawi to prepare for the cyclone.\n\nEarlier in the week, Freddy's longevity and baffling trajectories caused the UN weather agency to set up a committee to determine whether it has broken the record as the longest-lasting tropical cyclone in recorded history after traversing more than 8,000 kilometres (5,000 miles) in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Freddy has already catapulted into the record books for the second-ever highest accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, a measurement of a cyclone's energy over time.\n\nFreddy is also the third storm on record to last more than 22 days, said NOAA's Carl Schreck. Hurricane John in 1994 and an unnamed Atlantic hurricane in 1899 are the other two. The natural weather event La Nina and a negative Indian Ocean Dipole, or a change of temperatures over the ocean, ''may have produced ocean temperatures and atmospheric circulations that made an event like this more likely,\" Schreck added.\n\nAny storm that can remain at such a \"strong intensity for so long and make two landfalls is important in terms of human impacts and in terms of science,'' said Kristen Corbosiero, professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany. \"Intense storms generally go through a series of eyewall replacement cycles and intensity fluctuations,\" where the cyclone begins to develop a a new eye, Corbosiero said. ''But Freddy didn't have these cycles for most of its life cycle. Trying to understand why, will be a good research topic.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "title": "Tropical Cyclone Freddy Hammers Mozambique for Second Time",
                    "body": "Record-breaking Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique on Saturday night, pounding the southern African nation with heavy rains and disrupting transport and telecommunications services.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France warned of \"destructive and devastating\" winds and \"dangerous seas and heavy rains\" that could lead to landslides. It said Freddy will go further inland through the weekend, generating heavy rains in Mozambique and southern Malawi, with rain also likely in Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\nIt's the second time Freddy has hit the country, with the cyclone originally making landfall late last month.\n\nM\u00e9t\u00e9o-France also raised concerns that Freddy is unlikely to weaken over land in the coming week and has a high probability of exiting back into the sea. Freddy made landfall with maximum wind speeds at sea measuring 155 kilometers an hour and sea gusts averaging 220 kilometers an hour, the agency said.\n\nFreddy was initially on course to make landfall in the country Friday night but stalled over the Mozambique channel. The cyclone then intensified on Saturday and regained strength as it barreled toward land, Mozambique's National Institute of Meteorology said.\n\nThe cyclone's second punch was showering a low-lying, vast land teeming with rivers and \"almost all of them have no dam\" to ease flooding, said Salomao Bandeira, a scientist at Mozambique's Universidade Eduardo Mondlane. Flooding in the country earlier this year slammed regions where major rivers are controlled by dams, allowing some degree of control, Bandeira said, raising fears this hit could lead to more destruction.\n\nThe projected deluge is already worrying health and disaster agencies in both Mozambique and Malawi, who have recently been battling cholera cases and other water-borne ailments. The U.N. and EU-led disaster alert system has already issued a red alert projecting that some 2.3 million people will be impacted. Mozambique's disaster institute has moved thousands of people to storm shelters in anticipation.\n\n\"More lives are being saved in Mozambique today\" due to early preparedness, Bandeira said.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, Malawi Red Cross said it had activated its early response teams in southern Malawi to prepare for the cyclone.\n\nEarlier in the week, Freddy's longevity and baffling trajectories caused the U.N. weather agency to set up a committee to determine whether it has broken the record as the longest-lasting tropical cyclone in recorded history after traversing more than 8,000 kilometers in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Freddy has already catapulted into the record books for the second-ever highest accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, a measurement of a cyclone's energy over time.\n\nFreddy is also the third storm on record to last more than 22 days, said NOAA's Carl Schreck. Hurricane John in 1994 and an unnamed Atlantic hurricane in 1899 are the other two. The natural weather event La Nina and a negative Indian Ocean Dipole, or a change of temperatures over the ocean, \"may have produced ocean temperatures and atmospheric circulations that made an event like this more likely,\" Schreck added.\n\nAny storm that can remain at such a \"strong intensity for so long and make two landfalls is important in terms of human impacts and in terms of science,\" said Kristen Corbosiero, professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany.\n\n\"Intense storms generally go through a series of eyewall replacement cycles and intensity fluctuations,\" where the cyclone begins to develop a a new eye, Corbosiero said. \"But Freddy didn't have these cycles for most of its life cycle. Trying to understand why, will be a good research topic.\"",

                    "title": "Record-Setting Cyclone Freddy Makes Third Landfall",
                    "body": "Over the weekend, Tropical Cyclone Freddy made its third and final landfall in central Mozambique. This is the cyclone's third landfall in the area: it arrived on the east coast of Madagascar on February 21 and transited over the southern coast of Mozambique three days later. The first landfall killed 17 and destroyed over 14,000 homes in Madagascar, while the second left 10 people dead and destroyed over 28,000 homes in Mozambique.\n\nOver the course of the last week, Freddy gradually intensified into a tropical cyclone once again over the Mozambique Channel before making a third landfall in the port town of Quelimane, Mozambique on Saturday. Meteorologists have warned that Freddy is a slow-moving cyclone and likely to pick up more moisture over the sea, bringing heavy rainfall. The downpour expected will be in the range of 200mm- 500mm depending on the area.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has described cyclone Freddy as a remarkable storm. It has been swirling for 35 days, crossed the entire South Indian Ocean and traveled more than 8,000 kilometers, from the northwest coast of Australia to Southern Africa.\n\n\"This kind of super zonal track is very rare. The most recent recorded cases were Tropical Cyclones Leon-Eline and Hudah, both in 2000, which like 2023 was a La Nina year,\" commented WMO.\n\nPreliminary results show that Freddy is likely to have established a new record as the longest-duration tropical cyclone in history. The current record is held by Hurricane John, which lasted 31 days in 1994. However, WMO said that the final determination of record takes time owing to a lengthy review of raw data.\n\nAccording to NASA, Freddy has set the record for having the highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of any southern hemisphere storm in history. ACE is an index used to measure the total amount of wind energy associated with a tropical cyclone over its lifetime.\n\nTropical Cyclone Freddy making its first landfall on the evening of February 21 (EUMETSAT)\n\n\"World record or not, Freddy will remain in any case an exceptional phenomenon for the history of the South-West Indian Ocean on many aspects: longevity, distance covered, remarkable maximum intensity, accumulated ACE amount and impact on inhabited lands,\" said Sebastien Langlade, Head of Operations at WMO's Regional Specialized Meteorological Center(Meteo-France), Reunion Island.\n\nThe severity of cyclones in Southern Africa region has continued to increase in intensity over the last couple of years due to climate change. In 2022 alone, Mozambique experienced two tropical storms and one tropical cyclone (named Gombe). The cyclone affected over 700,000 people and left another 63 dead.\n\nThe rise in the number of tropical cyclones in the western Indian Ocean is in tandem with multiple climate projections so far made in the region. Scientists believe that cyclone seasons are being made more intense by the rapidly heating Indian Ocean. Global warming is accelerating the rate of the ocean heating, leading to increased number of cyclones and rapid intensification of weak storms. Cyclones are much more likely to gather intensity over warm waters.\n\n\"The entire Indian Ocean is warming at a faster rate compared to the Atlantic or Pacific. And within the Indian Ocean, the western parts of the Indian Ocean are warming much more. We see that sea surface temperature rise is connected with the changes in the intensity and frequency of cyclones,\" said Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.",

And that's just with this initial bit of rain.\"\n\nOn Friday, authorities said more than half a million people were at risk.\n\nThe storm was expected to drop up to 400 millimetres of rain over the next few days, more than twice the usual monthly rainfall.\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off northwestern Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and battered Madagascar from February 21, crossing the island before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nDuring the first deadly visit it destroyed, damaged or flooded more than 28,000 homes, affecting about 166,000 people.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 27 people - 10 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nTaylor noted concern that renewed flooding could exacerbate a cholera outbreak that has killed at least 38 people and infected almost 8 000 since September.\n\nThe disease, which causes diarrhoea and vomiting, is contracted from a bacterium that is generally transmitted through contaminated food or water.",

                    "body": "For more than a month, Tropical Cyclone Freddy has cast about in the Indian Ocean\n\nFor more than a month, Tropical Cyclone Freddy has cast about in the Indian Ocean, bringing powerful winds and downpours to anything in its long and wandering path.\n\nThe storm first developed off the North Australian coast on February 6, 2023, and then tracked across the entire Indian Ocean before striking the east coast of Madagascar on February 21, 2023. It then crossed the Mozambique Channel and made landfall in Mozambique's Inhambane province near Vilankulo, where it stalled and dropped a huge amount of rain before doubling back and nearly hit the west coast of Madagascar again. As of March 8, 2023, the weakening storm was following a northwesterly track toward a likely second landfall in Mozambique -- this time in the Zambezia province.\n\nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the NOAA-20 satellite acquired this image of the storm at 1:10 p.m. local time (11:10 Universal Time) on March 8, 2023. An infusion of dry air and the storm's position over relatively cool waters meant Freddy was weakening and the eye had broken down when the image was acquired. However, forecasters at the Joint Typhoon Warning Center warned that Freddy will likely still hit Mozambique with sustained winds of 139 kilometers (86 miles) per hour, making it the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane.\n\nOver the course of Freddy's 32-day journey, the World Meteorological Organization says the storm likely became the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record. The previous record holder, Hurricane John, persisted for 31 days in the Central Pacific in 1994.\n\nMeteorologists tracking Freddy's accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) -- a metric that incorporates both intensity and duration -- say the storm had an ACE of 72 as of March 7, 2023. That put it in second place for the most accumulated cyclone energy generated by a single storm since 1980, according to Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Philip Klotzbach. Ioke, a 2006 hurricane in the central Pacific, holds the record with an ACE of 85.",

On March 7, it became the longest-lived tropical cyclone ever recorded. Now it's shattered the record for the planet's most energetic storm.\n\nThe inexhaustible storm, which first developed on February 6 north of Western Australia, has already traced a 8850-kilometre path into south-eastern parts of Africa. It struck Madagascar on February 19 and Mozambique for the first time on February 24. Having crossed the Mozambique Channel three separate times, Freddy is now in the midst of its second Mozambique landfall.\n\nOn Sunday, Freddy was centred near the mouth of the Zambezi River in Mozambique and had winds of about 88 km/h. The storm crossed the coast on Saturday as the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane before gradually losing strength over land.\n\nThe storm was blamed for 27 deaths in Madagascar and Mozambique when it lashed the two countries last month. Amid its second landfall in Mozambique this weekend, at least one person has died, Reuters reports, but the full scope of the cyclone's toll is still unknown because \"communications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut\".",

At least one person was killed in Quelimane on Saturday when his house collapsed as the storm swept onshore.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nState TV reported that hundreds were displaced across the storm's path. More than 650 houses were destroyed in Marromeu district, it said, while in Sofala province more than 3,000 people were affected by flooding.\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nHowever, national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira and parts of the city of Mocuba.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" Unicef chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, Guy Taylor, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced.\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nA Zoom Earth satellite map laying out the cyclone's probable path forecast it would fizzle out near the Malawi border as it moves further inland early on Tuesday.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall. The storm formed off northwestern Australia and was named on Feb 6.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy - a former hurricane-strength storm lashing Mozambique for a second time - is solidifying its status as the most relentless tropical cyclone ever observed.\n\nOn March 7, it became the longest-lived tropical cyclone ever recorded. Now it's shattered the record for the planet's most energetic storm.\n\nThe inexhaustible storm, which first developed on February 6 between Western Australia and Indonesia, has already traced a 8850km path into southeastern parts of Africa.\n\nIt struck Madagascar on February 19 and Mozambique for the first time on February 24. Having crossed the Mozambique Channel three separate times, Freddy is now in the midst of its second Mozambique landfall.\n\n* Deadly cyclone Freddy has become Earth's longest-lived tropical storm\n\n* It was the second-deadliest Atlantic hurricane of 2019, but you probably can't name it\n\n* Hurricane Irma has already broken all these records\n\n* How is climate change rapidly fuelling super hurricanes like Ian?\n\nOn Sunday, Freddy was entered near the mouth of the Zambezi River in Mozambique and had winds of about 90kph.\n\nThe storm crossed the coast on Saturday as the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane before gradually losing strength over land.\n\nThe storm was blamed for 27 deaths in Madagascar and Mozambique when it lashed the two countries last month.\n\nAmid its second landfall in Mozambique this weekend, at least one person has died, Reuters reports, but the full scope of the cyclone's toll is still unknown because \"communications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut\".\n\nFreddy attained Category 5 strength twice over the open southern Indian Ocean in mid-February, and has been named for 34 days.\n\nThat eclipses the previous world record-holder, Hurricane John, which spent 31 days as a named Pacific storm between August 11 and September 13, 1994.\n\nIn addition, Freddy has rapidly intensified an unprecedented seven times, compared with the previous record, which was four times.\n\nRapid intensification describes a jump of 55kph or greater in a storm's winds in 24 hours or less. While most major hurricanes and storms do rapidly intensify at least once, anything more than three times in a storm's life cycle is exceptional.\n\nAfter smashing records for lasting so long and intensifying so often, Freddy managed to become Earth's most energetic storm ever observed after reaching a key threshold this weekend.\n\nHow much energy a storm churns through is calculated through a metric known as ACE, or Accumulated Cyclone Energy. It reflects both a storm's intensity and duration. Storms harvest such energy from warm ocean waters and expend it through their winds and by generating precipitation.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, Freddy had tallied somewhere in the neighbourhood of 86 ACE units, surpassing the record of 85.26 set by hurricane and typhoon Ioke in August to September 2006.\n\nThat's more ACE than 100 of the past 172 Atlantic hurricane seasons - not individual storms, but entire seasons' worth of ACE.\n\nWhile Freddy has nabbed records for rapid intensification, longevity and energy dispersed, it hasn't spent its whole life at hurricane strength. It weakened to a tropical storm after landfall in Madagascar on February 21 and a depression following its first landfall in Mozambique days later.\n\nIt's likely that Freddy will finally dissipate by late Monday or early Tuesday as it unloads its heavy rain in northern and central Mozambique. Some places could see roughly 635mm.\n\nWhile the mid-level circulation left behind by Freddy's remnants may drift back southeast over the Mozambique Channel into Wednesday, the shredded tropical entrails don't look to have any chance of coming back to life.",

                    "body": "Freddy slowed its advance towards the southern African nation and was 60 kilometres (40 miles) off the coast on Saturday morning, according to the Mozambique National Meteorology Institute (INAM).\n\n\"The system reduced its speed from seven to four kph, thus delaying its entry,\" INAM said in an update. \"Heavy rains and very strong winds\" were affecting the central provinces of Zambezia, Manica and Sofala, it added.\n\nThe cyclone, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Southern hemisphere, previously made landfall on February 6.\n\nWhile satellite data shows it seems to have stalled offshore, residents have taken precautionary measures.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the previous record was held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994.\n\nThe cyclone is slow-moving, which meteorological experts have said meant it would pick up more moisture off the sea, bringing heavy rainfall.\n\nAround the world, climate change is making hurricanes wetter, windier and stronger, scientists have said. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, bringing heavy rains and floods that damaged crops and destroyed houses, with OCHA putting its death toll at 27 so far - 10 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nMore than half a million people are at risk in Mozambique this time, particularly in Tete, Sofala, Nampula and Zambezia provinces.",

                    "body": "JOHANNESBURG -- Cyclone Freddy displaced hundreds of people as it battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear. At least one person was killed in Quelimane on Saturday when his house collapsed as the storm swept onshore.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cycloneswept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nState TV reported that hundreds were displaced across the storm's path. More than 650 houses were destroyed in Marromeu district, it said, while in Sofala province more than 3,000 people were affected by flooding.\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing inland towards the southern tip of neighboring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nHowever, national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira, and parts of the city of Mocuba.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, Guy Taylor, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced.\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nA Zoom Earth satellite map laying out the cyclone's probable path forecast it would fizzle out near the Malawi border as it moves further inland at around 2.00 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Tuesday.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.",

More than 171 000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique after making the first landfall last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar.\n\nMore than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nMore than 650 houses were destroyed in Marromeu district, it said, while in Sofala province more than 3 000 people were affected by flooding.\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nA Zoom Earth satellite map laying out the cyclone's probable path forecast it would fizzle out near the Malawi border as it moves further inland at around 2am on Tuesday.\n\nFreddy arrived in the Mozambique Channel on February 22 after passing over Madagascar on its long journey from near Australia, and remained in the channel for two days, before making landfall on the Mozambique coast around Maxixe, about 400km from the south eastern border of Zimbabwe, before moving inland.\n\nThe tropical storm then retraced its path back to the Mozambican Channel, but made a U-turn just near Madagascar after gaining some strength and made a second landfall in Mozambique on Saturday.",

                    "body": "Maputo, 12 Mar (AIM) - The chairperson of the Mozambican relief agency, the National Disaster Management Institute (INGD), Luisa Meque, has ordered the compulsory removal of people still living in flood-prone areas, in parts of Zambezia, Sofala and Manica provinces threatened by cyclone Freddy.\n\nAs from Friday, the storm was already being felt along the Zambezia coast, and in the provincial capital, Quelimane. It was feared that, in Zambezia alone, the cyclone could affect about 170,000 people.\n\nThe INGD has sent teams to assist in the removal of people from dangerous areas, particularly near the banks of the Licungo river.\n\n\"We are focusing on compulsory removal\", said Meque. \"The greater the number of people we remove from these areas, the fewer will be the number of human victims of the cyclone\".\n\n\"During the occurrence of the cyclone, nobody should be circulating on the roads\", she added. \"We must guarantee that people are in safe places, after the storm passes and that we will be able to assess the damage caused\".\n\nAcacio Tembe, of the National Meteorology Institute (INAM),told a meeting of the Emergency Operational Committee (CENOE) that Freddy could remain in the Mozambique Channel until 14 March, bringing heavy rains of up to 200 millimetres in 24 hours.\n\nAccording to the US Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC), as Freddy made landfall its wind speed was 80 knots (about 150 kilometres an hour). However, by Tuesday, the JTWC expects the wind speed to drop to 30 knots.\n\nIn Tete province, the provincial government ordered the suspension of classes in all schools in areas that might be affected by the cyclone, notably in Doa and Mutarara districts in the Lower Zambezi valley.\n\nThe Secretary of State for Tete, Elisa Zacarias, recommended that the district governments and the local Disaster Risk Management Committees should find appropriate places to shelter those who might be affected by the storm.\n\nZacarias urged people still living in flood-prone areas to move to higher ground immediately to avoid loss of life, since the forecast is for continued heavy rains and strong winds.\n\nTo reduce the risk of flooding on the lower Zambezi, the Cahora Bassa dam is reducing the discharges through its floodgates.\n\nThe Central Regional Water Board (ARA-Centro) announced that, as from Friday, Cahora Bassa is reducing its discharges from 3,500 to 2,000 cubic metres a second. It is hoped that this will minimize the impact of the cyclone downstream from the dam.\n\n\"After the passage of cyclone Freddy, and without compromising the integrity of the dam, Cahora Bassa will resume discharges of about 3,500 cubic metres a second\", said ARA-Centro.",

                    "body": "The inexhaustible storm, which first developed on Feb. 6 between Western Australia and Indonesia, has already traced a 5,500-mile path into southeastern parts of Africa. It struck Madagascar on Feb. 19 and Mozambique for the first time on Feb. 24. Having crossed the Mozambique Channel three separate times, Freddy is now in the midst of its second Mozambique landfall.\n\nOn Sunday, Freddy was centered near the mouth of the Zambezi River in Mozambique and had winds of about 55 mph. The storm crossed the coast on Saturday as the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane before gradually losing strength over land.\n\nThe storm was blamed for 27 deaths in Madagascar and Mozambique when it lashed the two countries last month. Amid its second landfall in Mozambique this weekend, at least one person has died, Reuters reports, but the full scope of the cyclone's toll is still unknown because \"communications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut.\"\n\nFreddy attained Category 5 strength twice over the open southern Indian Ocean in mid-February, and has been named for 34 days. That eclipses the previous world record-holder, Hurricane John, which spent 31 days as a named Pacific storm between Aug. 11 and Sept. 13, 1994.\n\nIn addition, Freddy has rapidly intensified an unprecedented seven times, compared with the previous record, which was four times. Rapid intensification describes a jump of 35 mph or greater in a storm's winds in 24 hours or less. While most major hurricanes and storms do rapidly intensify at least once, anything more than three times in a storm's life cycle is exceptional.\n\nAfter smashing records for lasting so long and intensifying so often, Freddy managed to become Earth's most energetic storm ever observed after reaching a key threshold this weekend.\n\nHow much energy a storm churns through is calculated through a metric known as ACE, or Accumulated Cyclone Energy. It reflects both a storm's intensity and duration. Storms harvest such energy from warm ocean waters and expend it through their winds and by generating precipitation.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, Freddy had tallied somewhere in the neighborhood of 86 ACE units, surpassing the record of 85.26 set by hurricane and typhoon Ioke in August to September 2006. That's more ACE than 100 of the past 172 Atlantic hurricane seasons -- not individual storms, but entire seasons' worth of ACE.\n\nWhile Freddy has nabbed records for rapid intensification, longevity and energy dispersed, it hasn't spent its whole life at hurricane strength. It weakened to a tropical storm after landfall in Madagascar on Feb. 21 and a depression following its first landfall in Mozambique days later.\n\nIt's likely that Freddy will finally dissipate by late Monday or early Tuesday as it unloads its heavy rain in northern and central Mozambique. Some places could see roughly 25 inches.\n\nWhile the mid-level circulation left behind by Freddy's remnants may drift back southeast over the Mozambique Channel into Wednesday, the shredded tropical entrails don't look to have any chance of coming back to life.",

                    "body": "A tree lays across a street in Quelimane, Mozambique, March 12, 2023. Record-breaking Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique Saturday night\n\nCyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month and breaking records for duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million people are at risk of being affected Mozambique this time, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAfter passing by the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing on inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nCommunications and electricity to Quelimane have been cut, making it difficult to assess the extent of the damage. At least one person was killed there on Saturday when his house collapsed on him as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported. Two weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on February 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record being held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fueling more destructive storms.\n\nRelated Stories",

                    "body": "AUSTIN (KXAN) -- Tropical cyclone season in our part of the world typically starts in mid-May in the eastern Pacific Ocean and in June in the Atlantic Basin, which also includes the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIt's different for Australia and the South Pacific, where their cyclone season runs from November to April. We really don't hear a great deal about the cyclone season there. That is, until now.\n\nMeet Cyclone Freddy. This storm has moved across the southern Indian Ocean since February 4. What's significant about this particular cyclone? It now owns the record for being the longest-living cyclone ever.\n\nThe previous record holder occurred in the summer of 1994. Hurricane John, also known as Typhoon John, lasted 30 days. It was formed on August 11, 1994. The storm peaked on August 23 when winds reached up to 175 mph. It dissipated on September 13. The Hawaiian Islands and Alaska were among the places this storm affected.\n\nAustralia's Bureau of Meteorology, in late January, was looking at an area of low pressure caught up in a monsoon trough in the Indian Ocean northwest of Australia. A monsoon trough is an area of low pressure along the Intertropical Convergence Zone that causes an increase in precipitation over land.\n\nBy Feb. 4, the Bureau detected a disturbance north-northwest of Broome in Western Australia. This was the day of Freddy's formation. Two days later, with winds reaching between 39 and 55 mph, the storm was given its name.\n\nThere are times when refer to weather whiplash or roller coaster temperatures in discussing our weather. That's what's happened with Freddy during its lifecycle, not with temperatures but with the wind. It has weakened and strengthened seven times since its formation, the first cyclone to do this in the Southern hemisphere. The former record is three. The strongest winds, to date, have been 165 miles on February 19.\n\nCyclone Freddy also now has the record for the all-time highest Accumulated Cyclone Energy. This is a measurement of the energy released by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. The calculation factors wind speed in knots, and it is taken four times daily. Freddy has an ACE index of 84. The former record is 82 from Hurricane Ioke in 2006.\n\nAs earlier stated, Cyclone Freddy has traversed the entire southern Indian Ocean since early February. It made its first landfall near Mananjary, Madagascar, on February 21. It weakened over land as all tropical cyclones do, but once it moved back over the water, it got stronger.\n\nMozambique has borne the brunt of Cyclone Freddy. The South African national has been struck two times -- the first on February 24. It moved back over the water, where it meandered for a few weeks.\n\nIt came back to strike again Saturday, March 11, with winds up to 100 mph and sea gusts clocked up to 140 mph, according to the French weather agency. This second strike resulted in a fatality. The storm surge was predicted to be anywhere from seven to 11 feet in an area where much of the elevation is under six feet.\n\nFreddy is the fourth system to move east to west across the southern Indian Ocean. The others were Cyclone Litanne in 1994 and Cyclone Leon-Eline and Cyclone Hudah in 2000.\n\nThe Sunday morning forecast shows weakening now that it is over land. Winds are predicted to continue dropping down to near 35 mph by Monday evening.",

                    "body": "We can be a little Atlantic-centric here in the United States when it comes to hurricanes. However, they do happen in other parts of the world. We just call them typhoons and cyclones. They are just as devastating and jaw-dropping irrespective of terminology. Many of you reading this article may not know about Cyclone Freddy, but you should. It is breaking records and could end up being the longest-lived tropical cyclone in recorded history.\n\nFreddy actually formed on February 6th, 2023 near Indonesia and made landfall in Madagascar on February 21st, 2023. While making landfall as a Category 3 storm in the region, on February 24th, the system was downgraded to a tropical storm but still produced between 1 to 2 feet of rainfall in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. This amount of rainfall is very problematic in countries that already exhibit extreme vulnerability from a socio-economic, infrastructure and health perspective.\n\nHere's the further problem. It regained intensity over the Mozambique Channel and impacted the region for a second time. According to Reuters, \"More than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar.\" The news agency is also reporting that over 500,000 people are at risk according to the United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. It is utterly stunning that in the second week of March, we are still talking about Freddy. Freddy, which has been persistently tracked by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, made landfall again this weekend in Mozambique.\n\nHere are some of the records Cyclone Freddy has already (or may have) broken according to experts at Colorado State University's Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA):\n\nAccording to NASA's Earth Observatory, \"The longest-lived tropical cyclone in the southern hemisphere was Leon-Eline in 2000, which was sustained for 18.5 days and traveled a similar path to Freddy.\" The World Meteorological Organization issued a press release saying that it is, \"Setting up an expert committee to evaluate whether tropical cyclone Freddy has broken the record as the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\" The previous record is Hurricane/Typhoon John (31 days, 1994).",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\n\u00a9 Provided by CNN Satellite imagery shows Tropical Cyclone Freddy approaching Madagascar. - NASA/Worldview/Reuters\n\nUNICEF said in a statement that Freddy made landfall with sustained winds of nearly 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour), causing \"severe damage and cutting off children and families from critical services.\" After passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm continued inland towards the southern tip of neighboring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nLoad Error\n\nHowever, the national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira and parts of the city of Mocuba.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" Guy Taylor, the UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced.\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by CNN A tree lays across a street in Quelimane on Sunday after Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique. - AP\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nFreddy developed on February 6 off the northwest Australian coast, before tracking thousands of miles across the South Indian Ocean towards southeast Africa, affecting the islands of Mauritius and La R\u00e9union on the way.\n\nThe storm hit the eastern coast of Madagascar on February 21 before slamming into Mozambique a few days later, bringing torrential rain, destructive winds and flooding which has destroyed houses and affected nearly 2 million people.\n\nIt then looped back out towards the Mozambique Channel, gaining energy from the warm waters, and headed toward the southwestern coast of Madagascar.\n\nCNN's Stephanie Busari contributed to this report\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "Branches of trees sway as cyclone Freddy makes hits in Quelimane, Mozambique, on Sunday.\n\nCyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nSatellite imagery shows Tropical Cyclone Freddy approaching Madagascar. NASA/Worldview/Reuters\n\nUNICEF said in a statement that Freddy made landfall with sustained winds of nearly 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour), causing \"severe damage and cutting off children and families from critical services.\" After passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm continued inland towards the southern tip of neighboring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nHowever, the national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira and parts of the city of Mocuba.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" Guy Taylor, the UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced.\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\nA tree lays across a street in Quelimane on Sunday after Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique. AP\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nFreddy developed on February 6 off the northwest Australian coast, before tracking thousands of miles across the South Indian Ocean towards southeast Africa, affecting the islands of Mauritius and La R\u00e9union on the way.\n\nThe storm hit the eastern coast of Madagascar on February 21 before slamming into Mozambique a few days later, bringing torrential rain, destructive winds and flooding which has destroyed houses and affected nearly 2 million people.\n\nIt then looped back out towards the Mozambique Channel, gaining energy from the warm waters, and headed toward the southwestern coast of Madagascar.\n\nCNN's Stephanie Busari contributed to this report",

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say.\n\nOceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fueling more destructive storms.",

                    "body": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -Cyclone Freddy displaced hundreds of people as it battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters FILE PHOTO: Satellite imagery show Cyclone Freddy approaching Madagascar \u00a9 Thomson Reuters Fallen branches are seen on a street as Storm Freddy is due to hit Mozambique again\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear. At least one person was killed in Quelimane on Saturday when his house collapsed as the storm swept onshore.\n\nLoad Error\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cycloneswept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nState TV reported that hundreds were displaced across the storm's path. More than 650 houses were destroyed in Marromeu district, it said, while in Sofala province more than 3,000 people were affected by flooding.\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nHowever, national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira and parts of the city of Mocuba.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, Guy Taylor, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters Teenager works on the roof of his house as Storm Freddy is due to hit Mozambique again\n\nADDITIONAL SUPPORT\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nA Zoom Earth satellite map laying out the cyclone's probable path forecast it would fizzle out near the Malawi border as it moves further inland at around 2.00 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Tuesday.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Cocks in Johannesburg; Additional reporting by Manuel Mucari in Maputo and Frank Phiri in Blantyre; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and David Holmes)\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy displaced hundreds of people as it battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere. Communications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear.\n\nCyclone Freddy displaced hundreds of people as it battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear. At least one person was killed in Quelimane on Saturday when his house collapsed as the storm swept onshore. More than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nState TV reported that hundreds were displaced across the storm's path. More than 650 houses were destroyed in Marromeu district, it said, while in Sofala province more than 3,000 people were affected by flooding. After passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nHowever, national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira and parts of the city of Mocuba. \"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, Guy Taylor, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced.\n\nADDITIONAL SUPPORT \"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement. A Zoom Earth satellite map laying out the cyclone's probable path forecast it would fizzle out near the Malawi border as it moves further inland at around 2.00 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Tuesday.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6. After swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration. Climate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -Cyclone Freddy displaced hundreds of people as it battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear. At least one person was killed in Quelimane on Saturday when his house collapsed as the storm swept onshore.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cycloneswept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nState TV reported that hundreds were displaced across the storm's path. More than 650 houses were destroyed in Marromeu district, it said, while in Sofala province more than 3,000 people were affected by flooding.\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nHowever, national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira and parts of the city of Mocuba.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, Guy Taylor, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced.\n\nADDITIONAL SUPPORT\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nA Zoom Earth satellite map laying out the cyclone's probable path forecast it would fizzle out near the Malawi border as it moves further inland at around 2.00 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Tuesday.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Cocks in Johannesburg; Additional reporting by Manuel Mucari in Maputo and Frank Phiri in Blantyre; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and David Holmes)",

It's really scary,\" charity worker Vania Massingue, from the port city of Quelimane in Zambezia province, told Reuters.\n\nExperts says climate change is making tropical storms around the world wetter, windier and more intense.\n\nFreddy had already broken records for the strength it has accumulated over the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean for north-western Australia.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on March 12 after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear.\n\nMore than 1,71,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nHowever, the national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira and parts of the city of Mocuba.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, Guy Taylor, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced.\n\nAdditional support\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Mr. Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nSatellite imagery shows Tropical Cyclone Freddy approaching Madagascar in this undated satellite handout image obtained on February 20, 2023. | Photo Credit: Reuters\n\nA Zoom Earth satellite map laying out the cyclone's probable path forecast it would fizzle out near the Malawi border as it moves further inland at around 2.00 a.m. (0000 GMT).\n\nAt least one person was killed in Quelimane on Saturday when his house collapsed as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported. Two weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on February 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.",

It is the second time Freddy has made landfall in Mozambique.\n\nThe system is resulting in very intense rains, with 400 mm expected in Zambezia province over the 24 hours following landfall.\n\nSeveral rivers are currently at alert level; continuing intense rainfall expected to result in overflowing and widespread flooding.\n\nThe return of Freddy to Mozambique follows weeks of intense rainfall and flooding, which have already significantly impacted the southern and central parts of the country.\n\nSince second landfall, WFP has been participating in government coordination platforms, sharing information and identifying areas to support the response. WFP's priority is staff safety, while ensuring the capacity to respond.\n\nWFP has so far provided food assistance in Sofala and Inhambane provinces, in response to Freddy's first landfall. Operational arrangements are finalised to scale up the response; WFP is ready to support government-led efforts.\n\nWFP is currently pre-financing the response through a corporate funding facility. Further resources will be required to facilitate a wider response in the coming weeks.",

Over the past couple of weeks, heavy rains and floods in Mozambique claimed the lives of at least 117 people.\n\nUp to 700 mm (28 inches) of further rainfall is expected near the landfall zone, which was already inundated by Freddy's first passage over a week ago. Widespread flooding is expected over the entire region of northern Mozambique, and into southern Malawi where over 200 mm (8 inches) are possible.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nHowever, the national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira and parts of the city of Mocuba.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, Guy Taylor, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced.\n\nADDITIONAL SUPPORT\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\nIn Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nA Zoom Earth satellite map laying out the cyclone's probable path forecast it would fizzle out near the Malawi border as it moves further inland at around 2.00 a.m. (0000 GMT).\n\nAt least one person was killed in Quelimane on Saturday when his house collapsed as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported. Two weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.",

According to the National Meteorological Institute, on Saturday morning Freddy slowed down as it approached the country and was 60 kilometers off the coast. As of now, the storm passed by the port town of Quelimane, and continued on inland towards the southern tip of neighboring Malawi. Media reported that the storm killed at least one person, bringing the overall death toll to at least 28 since its first landfall.Recent data from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) indicated that more than 470,000 people had been affected by the storm's passage in Madagascar and Mozambique last month, including almost 300,000 people in Madagascar and about 171,400 people in Mozambique. This time the office projects that more than half a million people are at risk of being affected by the cyclone in Mozambique.The cyclone is already dubbed as one of the strongest storms recorded in the southern hemisphere. According to the US National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, Freddy set a record for all-time accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, for the southern hemisphere, as well as globally, since Hurricane Ioke in 2006. The cyclone, which has been swirling for 35 days, is also on course to break the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994.",

                    "body": "Cyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere. Communications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear.\n\nCyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month, breaking records for the duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nCommunications and electricity supply in the storm area have been cut so the extent of the damage and number of casualties were not clear. More than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million are at risk of being affected in Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAfter passing the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed. However, the national power company Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique said that by mid-afternoon electricity had been restored in most areas, with the exception of Milange, Lugela, Maganja da Costa, Namanjavira and parts of the city of Mocuba.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Mozambique, Guy Taylor, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" Taylor said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall. In Malawi, authorities were bracing for the cyclone to pass near the southern tip of the landlocked country by evening, bringing torrential rains and flooding, the department of meteorological resources and climate change said in a statement.\n\nA Zoom Earth satellite map laying out the cyclone's probable path forecast it would fizzle out near the Malawi border as it moves further inland at around 2.00 a.m. (0000 GMT). At least one person was killed in Quelimane on Saturday when his house collapsed as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported. Two weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization. It has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "Image of Tropical Cyclone Freddy captured on March 8, 2023, by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the NOAA-20 satellite.\n\nTropical Cyclone Freddy, an unusually long-lived storm, wandered in the Indian Ocean for more than a month.\n\nFor more than a month, Tropical Cyclone Freddy has cast about in the Indian Ocean, bringing powerful winds and downpours to anything in its long and wandering path.\n\nThe storm first developed off the North Australian coast on February 6, 2023, and then tracked across the entire Indian Ocean before striking the east coast of Madagascar on February 21, 2023. It then crossed the Mozambique Channel and made landfall in Mozambique's Inhambane province near Vilankulo, where it stalled and dropped a huge amount of rain before doubling back and nearly hit the west coast of Madagascar again. As of March 8, 2023, the weakening storm was following a northwesterly track toward a likely second landfall in Mozambique -- this time in the Zambezia province.\n\nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the NOAA-20 satellite acquired this image of the storm at 1:10 p.m. local time (11:10 Universal Time) on March 8, 2023. An infusion of dry air and the storm's position over relatively cool waters meant Freddy was weakening and the eye had broken down when the image was acquired. However, forecasters at the Joint Typhoon Warning Center warned that Freddy will likely still hit Mozambique with sustained winds of 139 kilometers (86 miles) per hour, making it the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane.\n\nOver the course of Freddy's 32-day journey, the World Meteorological Organization says the storm likely became the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record. The previous record holder, Hurricane John, persisted for 31 days in the Central Pacific in 1994.\n\nMeteorologists tracking Freddy's accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) -- a metric that incorporates both intensity and duration -- say the storm had an ACE of 72 as of March 7, 2023. That put it in second place for the most accumulated cyclone energy generated by a single storm since 1980, according to Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Philip Klotzbach. Ioke, a 2006 hurricane in the central Pacific, holds the record with an ACE of 85.",

                    "body": "\"Freddy made landfall in Mozambique in Quelimane district, Zambezia province, as a tropical cyclone,\" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement.\n\nIt also said there was a high risk of flooding in Zambezia and Nampula provinces, with water levels at several river basins already above alert levels.\n\n\"There is already quite substantial flooding,\" Guy Taylor, spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF, told the AFP news agency from Quelimane earlier on Saturday. \"We saw people with water in their houses, wading through knee-deep water. And that's just with this initial bit of rain.\"\n\nMozambique is still reeling from last month's flooding on Freddy's first pass and has been battling to contain a cholera outbreak since September. Cholera is generally transmitted via the consumption of contaminated food or water.\n\nThe UN and EU-led disaster alert system has issued a red alert saying some 2.3 million people could be affected.\n\nSecond pass over Mozambique for long-lived storm\n\nFreddy is on its way to being the longest-lasting cyclone on record, having taken a looping trajectory that meteorologists say is rare.\n\nIt crossed the entire Southern Indian Ocean and battered Madagascar from February 21, then crossed the island to hit Mozambique on February 24. Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving, once more, towards Mozambique.\n\nCurrently, Freddy is only the third major storm known to have lasted more than 22 days, according to US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Carl Schreck. Hurricane John in 1994 and an unnamed Atlantic hurricane in 1899 are the other two.\n\nFrench weather agency Meteo-France said that the cyclone was unlikely to weaken over land in the coming week and had a high probability of exiting back into the sea. Making landfall in Mozambique with maximum speeds of 155 kilometers per hour (just under 100 miles per hour), Meteo-France warned that \"destructive and devastating\" winds and \"dangerous seas and heavy rains\" could lead to landslides.\n\nFreddy's first pass over southeastern Africa last month damaged roughly 28,000 homes and affected around 166,000 people. The storm is thought to have killed at least 27 -- 10 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.",

                    "body": "Johannesburg, Mar. 12 (BNA): Cyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month and breaking records for duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million people are at risk of being affected Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAfter passing by the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing on inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed. Communications and electricity to Quelimane have been cut, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The wind was very strong into the night ... There is a lot of destruction, trees fallen down, roofs blown off,\" UNICEF chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships, Guy Taylor, told Reuters by satellite phone from Quelimane. He had no word yet on casualties or numbers of displaced, he said.\n\n\"It's potentially a disaster of large magnitude, and additional support will be needed,\" he said, adding that heavy rains were continuing to fall.\n\nAt least one person was killed there on Saturday when his house collapsed on him as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported. Two weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.",

More than half a million people are at risk of being affected Mozambique this time, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAfter passing by the port town of Qeuellimane, the storm was continuing on inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nCommunications and electricity to Qeuellimane have been cut, making it difficult to assess the extent of the damage. At least one person was killed there on Saturday when his house collapsed on him as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record was held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.",

                    "body": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Cyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month and breaking records for duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters FILE PHOTO: Satellite imagery show Cyclone Freddy approaching Madagascar\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cycloneswept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million people are at risk of being affected Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters Fallen branches are seen on a street as Storm Freddy is due to hit Mozambique again\n\nAfter passing by the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing on inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nCommunications and electricity to Quelimane have been cut, making it difficult to assess the extent of the damage. At least one person was killed there on Saturday when his house collapsed on him as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters Teenager works on the roof of his house as Storm Freddy is due to hit Mozambique again\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record was held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Cocks in Johannesburg; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

And that's just with this initial bit of rain.\"\n\nOn Friday, authorities said more than half a million people were at risk.\n\nThe storm was expected to drop up to 400 millimetres (16 inches) of rain over the next few days, more than twice the usual monthly rainfall.\n\nAccording to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Freddy, which formed off northwestern Australia in the first week in February, was set to become the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record.\n\nIt crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean and battered Madagascar from February 21, crossing the island before reaching Mozambique on February 24.\n\nFollowing what meteorologists describe as a \"rare\" loop trajectory, Freddy then headed back towards Madagascar before moving once more towards Mozambique.\n\nDuring the first deadly visit it destroyed, damaged or flooded more than 28,000 homes, affecting about 166,000 people.\n\nIn total, Freddy has so far killed at least 27 people -- 10 in Mozambique and 17 in Madagascar.\n\nTaylor noted concern that renewed flooding could exacerbate a cholera outbreak that has killed at least 38 people and infected almost 8,000 since September.\n\nThe disease, which causes diarrhoea and vomiting, is contracted from a bacterium that is generally transmitted through contaminated food or water.",

(PHOTO / AFP)\n\nJOHANNESBURG - Cyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month and breaking records for duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million people are at risk of being affected Mozambique this time, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAfter passing by the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing on inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed\n\nALSO READ: Record-breaking storm Freddy due to hit Mozambique again\n\nAfter passing by the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing on inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nCommunications and electricity to Quelimane have been cut, making it difficult to assess the extent of the damage. At least one person was killed there on Saturday when his house collapsed on him as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record was held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nREAD MORE: Almost 1m people at risk of food insecurity in northern Mozambique\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fueling more destructive storms.",

                    "body": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Cyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month and breaking records for duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cycloneswept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million people are at risk of being affected Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAfter passing by the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing on inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nCommunications and electricity to Quelimane have been cut, making it difficult to assess the extent of the damage. At least one person was killed there on Saturday when his house collapsed on him as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record was held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Cocks in Johannesburg; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)",

                    "body": "JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Reuters) - Cyclone Freddy battered central Mozambique on Sunday after making landfall for a second time in a month and breaking records for duration and strength of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere.\n\nMore than 171,000 people were affected after the cyclone swept through southern Mozambique last month, killing 27 people in Mozambique and Madagascar. More than half a million people are at risk of being affected Mozambique this time, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAfter passing by the port town of Quelimane, the storm was continuing on inland towards the southern tip of neighbouring Malawi, satellite data showed.\n\nCommunications and electricity to Quelimane have been cut, making it difficult to assess the extent of the damage. At least one person was killed there on Saturday when his house collapsed on him as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record was held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fuelling more destructive storms.

At least one person was killed there on Saturday when his house collapsed on him as the storm swept onshore, state TV reported.\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 died when the storm first made landfall, after first being spotted near Indonesia on Feb. 6.\n\nAfter swirling for 35 days, Freddy is likely to have broken the record for the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, with the previous record was held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIt has also set a record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a measure of the storm's strength over time, of any southern hemisphere storm in history, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger, scientists say. Oceans absorb much of the heat from greenhouse gas emissions, and when warm seawater evaporates its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere, fueling more destructive storms.

                    "body": "In a statement released Saturday, Malawi Red Cross said it had activated its early response teams in southern Malawi to prepare for the cyclone...reports Asian Lite News\n\nRecord-breaking Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique Saturday night, pounding the southern African nation with heavy rains and disrupting transport and telecommunications services.\n\nFrench weather agency M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France warned of \"destructive and devastating\" winds and \"dangerous seas and heavy rains\" that could lead to landslides. It said Freddy will go further inland through the weekend, generating heavy rains in Mozambique and southern Malawi, with rain also likely in Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\nIts the second time Freddy has hit the country, with the cyclone originally making landfall late last month.\n\nM\u00e9t\u00e9o-France also raised concerns that Freddy is unlikely to weaken over land in the coming week and has a high probability of exiting back into the sea. Freddy made landfall with maximum wind speeds at sea measuring 155 kilometers (around 100 miles) an hour and sea gusts averaging 220 kilometers (around 140 miles) an hour, the agency said.\n\nFreddy was initially on course to make landfall in the country Friday night but stalled over the Mozambique channel. The cyclone then intensified on Saturday and regained strength as it barrelled toward land, Mozambique's National Institute of Meteorology said.\n\nThe cyclone's second punch is showering a low-lying, vast land teeming with rivers and \"almost all of them have no dam\" to ease flooding, said Salomao Bandeira, a scientist at Mozambique's Universidade Eduardo Mondlane. Flooding in the country earlier this year slammed regions where major rivers are controlled by dams, allowing some degree of control, Bandeira said, raising fears this hit could lead to more destruction.\n\nThe projected deluge is already worrying health and disaster agencies in both Mozambique and Malawi, who have recently been battling cholera cases and other water-borne ailments. The U.N. and EU-led disaster alert system has already issued a red alert projecting that some 2.3 million people will be impacted. Mozambique's disaster institute has moved thousands of people to storm shelters in anticipation.\n\n\"More lives are being saved in Mozambique today\" due to early preparedness, Bandeira said.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, Malawi Red Cross said it had activated its early response teams in southern Malawi to prepare for the cyclone.\n\nEarlier in the week, Freddy's longevity and baffling trajectories caused the U.N. weather agency to set up a committee to determine whether it has broken the record as the longest-lasting tropical cyclone in recorded history after traversing more than 8,000 kilometres (5,000 miles) in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Freddy has already catapulted into the record books for the second-ever highest accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, a measurement of a cyclone's energy over time.\n\nFreddy is also the third storm on record to last more than 22 days, said NOAA's Carl Schreck. Hurricane John in 1994 and an unnamed Atlantic hurricane in 1899 are the other two. The natural weather event La Nina and a negative Indian Ocean Dipole, or a change of temperatures over the ocean, \"may have produced ocean temperatures and atmospheric circulations that made an event like this more likely,\" Schreck added.\n\nAny storm that can remain at such a \"strong intensity for so long and make two landfalls is important in terms of human impacts and in terms of science,\" said Kristen Corbosiero, professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany.",
