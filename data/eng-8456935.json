                    "body": "Personalized, reliable content continues to be the king according to the fundamental B2B marketing principles of recent years. Still, there are now more ways than ever to achieve that objective in the eyes of your audience. Here are the B2B marketing trends that we believe will endure through 2023.\n\nIt won't be prudent to ignore the economic issue as we anticipate 2023.\n\nYes, a recession is in the discussion.\n\nIt's crucial for marketing (and sales) organizations to concentrate on budgets and plans for weathering the storm when downturns are imminent. Of course, there is no magic solution.\n\nBut our marketing specialists do have some knowledge that could be useful. Look at them down below!\n\nAlice de Courcy, CMO of Cognism, offers some sound advice on incorporating the most recent B2B marketing trends into your strategy for the coming year when it comes to addressing customer behavior in uncertain times:\n\nYou must embrace the following fundamentals:\n\nThis implies that CMOs who haven't yet switched from lead generation to demand generation will find things growing more complex. The focus should be on consistently providing value to our customers frictionlessly at the locations where they choose to consume it.\n\nIn times of economic uncertainty, consumers will be more likely to turn to indirect sources when purchasing. As a result, the buyer journey will continue to be impacted. Customers appreciate professional networks more than direct marketing.\n\nTo adjust to this trend, B2B marketers must prioritize establishing and keeping solid relationships with these indirect sources. This can entail starting referral programs or collaborating with influential people and organizations.\n\nReaching out to current customers and generating meaningful material from their experiences using your product can help businesses increase their credibility.\n\nIt should be no surprise that demand creation is a favorite topic at Cognism. The dispute between lead generation and demand generation may appear old news, but our team begs to differ.\n\nTwo crucial areas, content diversification and the development of best practices, are where early adopters will continue to advance this marketing trend.\n\nThe lead generation vs. demand generation argument may be over, which is regrettably not the case. Many companies still need to start using outdated lead-generation strategies.\n\nThe idea of a demand-gen playbook is still in its infancy. There are many unknowns and no strict operating rules, which is a big reason why it hasn't been more widely adopted. The demand generation playbook is still in its infancy, though. There are numerous unknowns and no set procedures. This, in my opinion, is a significant factor in why it hasn't yet gained broader acceptance.\n\nWe've learned from the events of 2022 that we don't have to do things the same way we always have.\n\nFor instance, you can establish specific procedures for your demand gen campaigns. When you conduct a live webinar, you can separate it into six segments and share it on social media. As a result, you can have several procedures to feed your content engine and be value-led. You need to revisit such strategies frequently and revise them.\n\nMoving beyond just developing repeatable and scalable procedures is necessary to build best practices for a demand-gen marketing organization. To stack growth, you should instead rely on iterating those processes.\n\nYou may be good at making processes repeatable and scalable. But stacking growth is the component that you should emphasize for 2023. How can you strengthen the existing procedures and make them better? Is there a way to gain access to new channels? How can you develop new procedures and projects to support your continued expansion?\n\nRemember - the most important lesson is that the benefits will wane no matter how well you do something.\n\nThroughout 2022, subject matter experts (SMEs) were a key B2B marketing trend. Some marketing executives have already invested their funds in this area.\n\nHowever, not all SMEs are created equal, and 2023 is the year to forge lasting strategic alliances with your sector experts.\n\nIt will become more difficult to separate from the crowd as more marketers engage in SMEs. As a result, you must invest in your SMEs to help you create a longer-term plan that will enable you to accomplish those three crucial goals: raising brand awareness, establishing credibility, and educating your audience.\n\nA demand generation engine's success depends on its capacity to let your audience read, enjoy, and benefit from your content.\n\nYou will never succeed here if the content isn't from a real subject matter expert. In 2023, we'll see more organizations hiring SMEs or developing systems that allow organizations to work with SMEs consistently.\n\nMany businesses will balance their budgets as they become more constrained and teams concentrate on what's most crucial -- driving revenue. Weighing the need to preserve that vital personal connection against when to utilize statistics to guide decision-making.\n\nMarketing teams should focus on data to make wise judgments as organizations aim to save costs.\n\nThis is where data from AI-driven analytics is useful. It will help with more effective client targeting, needs analysis, and behavior predictions. The creation of a B2B marketing landscape strategy will require consideration of these essential findings.\n\nBefore examining the data, marketers should engage with consumers and prospects more frequently.\n\nMany marketers have distanced themselves and were only interested in attribution tools. And that was because so much technology was available, and everyone felt it was wonderful.\n\nSimilarly, if you solely talk to customers, you might make bad choices because your CRM data on customer purchase motivations will always provide you with the appropriate response. But it's kind of like a mixture of both.\n\nBut does your team already have the necessary tech stack and solid digital literacy?\n\nAccording to the Marketing Profs study, 61% of respondents lacked the necessary technology or weren't using it best to manage content. This implies that many businesses are creating IT stacks without a clear plan, which makes things much more difficult in unstable economic times.\n\nImagine a world where everyone could construct websites, analyze complex data, handle vast amounts of material, develop automation logic, combine many apps to function together, and more. Because \"no code\" is changing marketing technology, you don't need to imagine.\n\nEven though the name is self-explanatory, let's first define \"no code.\" The recent trend of \"no code\" capabilities in apps and software allows users with little to no coding experience to access functions that would often require some technical knowledge. Building websites, designing, blogging, and analyzing data from many sources -- things that were formerly challenging -- have all become as simple as signing up for software and connecting it all.\n\nWith the proliferation of no-code apps, it is now simpler than ever for marketers to delve into uncharted waters. People who have never even touched a website, for instance, may use it to post blogs, construct stunning landing pages, and even complete SEO plans.\n\nWebsite design and development, data analysis, and automation are three essential marketing areas where no coding has been applied. These components of the business, which are typically among the most complex, have been made simple enough for most individuals to use them efficiently without having significant back-end coding skills.\n\nNothing appears more complex than building up internal workflows and automated marketing campaigns. Applications that require \"no code\" have made it simple to create automated marketing and sales actions. To set up a fluid workflow creation process, these apps will help you link and integrate a variety of products that you use.\n\nThe most considerable upgrade, the Spam update, which Google tested in October 2022, was one of several new ones related to content and linkages. Algorithm engineers are actively addressing the problem of AI-generated content.\n\nB2B marketers must produce original content that benefits their target audience. SEO Over the past six months, Twitter has been highly vocal about losing all of its SEO traffic. Deprioritizing websites that provide mediocre content and low-quality links is a skill at which Google's machine-learning algorithm constantly improves.\n\nVoice Search is another B2B marketing trend that grew in popularity in 2022 and will continue to grow.\n\nSEO needs to be optimized for various mediums to be relevant in 2023. It's important to address text, voice, and image searches.\n\nFor instance, voice search improves your site's usability and functionality, making it accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.\n\nIt's not just about adhering to the ADA, ethical web design, and CSR goals; it's also beneficial to the business's cash line by reaching a larger audience. Enhancing SEO doesn't have to be expensive.\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is becoming increasingly prevalent among B2B marketers as they continue to draw ideas from the B2C playbook.\n\nIt is logical. In a cutthroat industry, peer-to-peer recommendations are essential for fostering transparency and authenticity.\n\nUser-generated content for B2B is becoming more reputable and well-liked, much like influencer marketing. More and more companies are incorporating it into their strategy, and so far, it appears they are doing the right thing.\n\nUser-generated content\" refers to legitimate and pertinent information from users, i.e., users whom the target audience may trust since they have similar traits.\n\nWorking actively on user-generated content improves brand recognition, enhances the brand's image, aids in customer loyalty, and fosters consumer advocacy. For B2B, 2023 will be the year of user-generated content.\n\nCognism uses user-generated content in several ways, including customer case studies, social proof reviews, video testimonials, and G2 reviews.\n\nAdditionally, you must urge marketers in your team to develop their online personas. By becoming SMEs, you can reach more consumers outside of the owned media format.\n\nB2B PR in 2023 can be anything from a New York Times story to a Product Hunt campaign.\n\nAny PR campaign's main objective is to increase awareness of your brand and develop a solid, sincere reputation. Your brand, your PR team or B2B PR agency, and your immediate aims will influence how you do this.\n\nLike other recent trends, the increasing relevance of PR may be traced back to trust. Your potential customers seek the main quality of trust, and they're more inclined to purchase from a company they dislike than one they like.\n\nOne of the best ways to establish trust is through an intelligent PR effort, enabling prospective customers to relate to your leadership, become familiar with your service, and develop a sound understanding of your brand.\n\nThink leadership is your brand's tremendous long-term PR investment, so don't undervalue its influence.\n\nEarned media aren't cheap. For many, it's the price; for others, it does not understand how PR is connected to sales and money. Others have suffered the consequences of PR teams with a communications foundation that doesn't link their PR initiatives to marketing and sales objectives.\n\nWorking with PR experts that understand how to link media coverage to sales targets will show you that PR is unquestionably a significant element of:\n\nThe number of fractional executives, virtual CMOs, and even virtual marketing practitioners at lower levels of an organization has increased over the last few years. The year of the virtual marketing partner, however, is this one.\n\nA virtual CMO oversees your marketing division; a virtual marketing practitioner is often any non-executive member of the marketing division. However, a virtual marketing partner is an organization like Zen that takes a different approach to working with clients. Compared to a standard marketing firm, which is more \"set it and forget it,\" this collaboration is far more involved and collaborative.\n\nA company may hire a virtual CMO connected to a virtual marketing partner. By doing so, you have access to additional marketing experts.\n\nHiring a partner entails a team of marketing professionals assisting your company with various tasks, such as researching your target market, analyzing the insights, identifying key strategies and messaging, and ultimately putting marketing tactics into practice to help you achieve your business objectives.\n\nDark social is hard to follow. It's the personal interactions people have on social media that the general public cannot see or follow, such as when coworkers chat about a potential new vendor over instant messaging or an HR representative inquires about a communications platform on a private Discord server. Fortunately, businesses may still impact the environment by being visible and going into the shadows themselves.\n\nPeople will discuss your brand on dark social if it is visible -- on social media, in the media, or as part of the important discussions in your sector. By joining shady social sites and communities, brands can forge close bonds with their customers (like Discord, Reddit, Facebook Groups, etc.)\n\nThen, rather than just dispensing material for consumption, brands can interact with their target market -- ask questions, pay attention to customer comments, and gather knowledge through social listening. People will pay attention if you hear their problems and thoughts, and your impact on dark social will increase.\n\nBuyers today are pickier than ever. They conduct the study, consult with colleagues about the advantages and disadvantages, and only occasionally, typically after they have made up their minds, do they turn to salespeople. In the current sales funnel, the marketer's close deals before the customer contacts a salesperson.\n\nBecause of this, businesses must be there and provide the details that customers want right where they are (hint: Social media).\n\nYou can influence the debates on dark social by participating in social media discussions and reaching out to your audience through paid advertisements. Your audience will trust you more if you interact with them frequently and sincerely handle their worries and inquiries.\n\nReduce the sales talk and instead provide clear, understandable information. Because they don't trust salespeople or slick marketing materials, marketers must integrate themselves into the daily discussions that their customers are already having.\n\nSome marketing trends are never-ending. The above list showcases the evolution of these over-time.",

                    "body": "Do you know the difference between marketing and advertising? All advertising is marketing, but not all marketing is advertising. It sounds like a riddle, which is why the two terms are often used interchangeably. The truth is, both concepts are related but different.\n\nKnowing the difference between the two might not be the single most important thing you need to be aware of as a business person, but this knowledge will come in handy when you are speaking to clients or managers who may assume these separate terms mean the same thing.\n\nSo what exactly is the difference? Advertising and marketing both have the same goal, and that is to get your business and messaging in front of your target customers. Let us start with some key differences between marketing and advertising.\n\nMarketing is all about fulfilling the unmet needs of the customers. It attempts to deliver value and provide satisfaction to the client through its offerings. Advertising is an organised, and composed, paid form of non-personal communication of ideas, goods and services by a recognised sponsor.\n\nMarketing is a discipline, while advertising is a branch of marketing. Marketing is a process with a unique selling proposition (USP) and strong content that describes your business. In contrast, advertising covers the placement of advertisements on different channels such as TV, newspaper, billboards, radio, online ads and social media.\n\nThe goal of marketing is to create awareness about a company, its product range, services, variants and stores. But the goal of advertising is to get a quick and intended response from the customer. This response can be through store visits, clicks, impressions and so forth. It will ultimately result in an increase in the company's sales.\n\nWhile marketing is for the long-term, meaning it aims to boost the value of a company and its products in the customer's eyes, advertising focuses on the short-term. Any advertisement that a company runs on various media is for a limited period only. Advertising is also done with a particular aim in mind.\n\nSuppose the company wants to convey information about the sale. It will advertise the same on various media to get the desired response from the public, so the message will reach the maximum number of persons possible. Marketing focuses on creating a market for the product and building a reputation, whereas advertising focuses on seeking public attention.\n\nWhile marketing facilitates the creation of awareness among consumers, advertising ensures the generation of sales for the company's products. Ultimately, the marketing process begins long before production of the product. It does not end with the conclusion of the sale but, rather, it works on making customers feel satisfied. Advertising is a slice of the pie, while marketing is the whole pie. Moreover, if advertising is all you are doing to market your business, you are missing out on opportunities (or slices of pie) to drive sales for your business. Until we meet again, fill your life with memories rather than regrets. Enjoy life and stay on top of your game.\n\n* NB: Columnist welcomes feedback at deedee21bastian@gmail.com\n\nABOUT COLUMNIST: Deidre M.

                    "title": "Top Most Key Techniques Of Digital Marketing That Every Fresher Should Know!",
                    "body": "Digital marketing promotes goods and services via online platforms like social media, search engine optimization (SEO), e-mail, and mobile apps. Digital marketing is any advertising that uses electronic media.\n\nIt can be done offline and online; a comprehensive digital marketing strategy should include both.\n\nThis brief explanation is a helpful reminder that investing in digital marketing should be based on results, not on adopting technology! Additionally, we must remember that even while digital devices are widely used for shopping, leisure, & work, users still need more money in the real world. As a result, traditional media integration is still crucial in many industries. To learn more techniques get a Digital Marketing Course in Chennai and get into practice.\n\nDigital marketing, in practice, focuses on managing various online firm presences, including company websites, mobile apps, & social media company pages, along with different online communication strategies that will be covered later in this explainer. Search engine optimization, social media marketing, content marketing, online advertising, e-mail marketing, and collaborations with other websites are a few of these.\n\nIn the last fifteen years, Smart Analytics has focused on teaching marketers how to approach digital marketing in a more organised, strategic, and data-driven manner.\n\nInternet marketing & digital marketing are both equal terms for online marketing. Most professionals in the field would view it in this way.\n\nHowever, as it refers to digital media, including the web, e-mail, and wireless media, in addition to the administration of digital consumer data & electronic customer relationship management, digital marketing is frequently thought to have a greater reach than online marketing (E-CRM systems).\n\nMarketers must decide which online communication strategies to include in their communication plan. When including the identification of always-on and campaign investments, marketers most frequently refer to six distinct digital media channels rather than the more general terms paid, owned, and earned media.\n\nWe advise considering the six social networking channels or communications tools, paid, owned, and earned, that are available to streamline the prioritisation process. This combination results in 18 digital communications approaches that firms can use. Companies with a tight media budget should concentrate on their Own and Earn strategies.\n\ngaining exposure in google to attract users who type a particular keyword phrase to visit a website. Paid listings using pay-per-click through Google Ads or Bing and listings within organic or natural rankings using search engine optimization (SEO), where no fee is charged for search engine hits, are two crucial search marketing approaches.\n\nA significant area of digital marketing is social media marketing, which involves promoting consumer interaction on a business's website, via social networks like Facebook or Twitter, or on specialised publisher sites, blogs, and forums. It can be used as an alternative for conventional broadcast media; for instance, businesses also use Facebook and Twitter to communicate with partners or consumers who've already signed in.\n\nDisplay advertising is comparable to sponsorship in that both involve paying for a brand's identity to be linked with an author or event over the long term.\n\nIn programmatic display, target audiences and media are chosen through trading or competitive bidding with other advertisers. Instead of using a banner ad, native advertising entails investing in publishing content that appears on a media website. It's comparable to when businesses pay for advertisements on newspaper covers.\n\nE-mail marketing, which remains a popular digital medium since it is affordable, has historically been the main emphasis of digital communications to subscribers. Younger audiences are more inclined to register for mobile message alerts from websites and apps and use e-mail less frequently.\n\nDigital messaging alternatives include co-marketing strategies employing the newsletters of other businesses, placing advertisements in final e-newsletters (paid media), or, most frequently, using an internal list for client activation & retaining (owned media). Privacy prohibits purchasing or renting e-mail address lists, as mentioned above because it is seen as a spamming technique.\n\nThe multimedia interactions depicted in the first image are a potent new marketing strategy now popularly recognised for inbound marketing, a phrase that HubSpot also supports. When a customer is actively looking for information to meet their needs & interactions between brands being attracted through content, search, and social media marketing, this is referred to as inbound marketing.\n\nBecause there are free or low-cost organic methods like natural social media campaigns and search engine optimization, inbound marketing is effective. Since we may target particular people while they are actively seeking out products and are self-selecting, advertising waste is decreased. This is a limitation because marketers could have little or no control, unlike in traditional communications, from which the content is pushed out to a specific audience and might aid in creating demand and awareness.\n\nOutstanding, captivating content is essential for permission marketing success. The terms \"content marketing\" and \"content strategy\" denote best-practice methods for interacting with viewers and achieving business objectives through content. This emphasises the significance of content creation to obtaining consent, promoting sharing, and maintaining interaction via websites and social media. There are now many more ways to interact with information bits through content in a rich range of formats, such as web pages, digital download guides, social posts, blog posts, videos, podcasts, & interactive product selectors, and quizzes. Previously, the content was bounded by the cost of distributing and printing brochures or direct mail.\n\n72% of online marketers describe content creation as their most effective SEO tactic. [1]\n\nThere were few opportunities for brands to communicate directly with audiences through traditional \"push\" media. Due to the difficulty in capturing and holding audiences' attention throughout today's fragmented media environment, the idea of client engagement has emerged as a significant issue that digital marketers are becoming increasingly concerned with.\n\nSince the term is frequently used informally to characterise audiences' brief interactions with a client, such as when a customer interacts with a single homepage, e-mail, or social media update, we must define engagement correctly.\n\nTherefore, digital marketing is using digital technologies to accomplish marketing goals. Digital doesn't necessarily need to operate independently from the marketing division because their goals are the same. Nevertheless, it is still relevant today because using digital technology efficiently necessitates specialised knowledge.\n\nBecause digital marketing has psychological effects on your customers, its potential future applications must be noticed. Compared to other marketing strategies, this gives you an edge over your competition.\n\nSince most firms have just recently entered the online market, they are still learning to use various techniques to achieve their goals. You, as an expert, and the company both stand to gain significantly from your keen insight and conviction in your ability to execute digital campaigns for enterprises. It may present opportunities for you as a recent graduate to work and demonstrate your abilities as a digital marketer.\n\nhttps://wpforms.com/digital-marketing-statistics/ [1]",

                    "body": "Over the last few years, marketing automation has quickly become a critical tool within organizations' tech stacks -- including small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- to grow sales pipelines, enhance customer support and increase revenue. In fact, in a 2022 Act! customer relationship management study, SMB owners stated that implementing marketing software and other innovative tech, like CRM, led to increased sales and business productivity, customer satisfaction and retention, marketing outreach and company growth and revenue. With marketing automation applications unlocking untapped markets and growth for businesses worldwide, it is no surprise that the global marketing automation market has reached new highs in 2022 ($5.2 billion), according to Markets and Markets.\n\nThe ability to simplify and streamline numerous marketing efforts, including email marketing, content marketing and SEO, enabled SMB owners to remain competitive amid the unprecedented challenges of years prior due to global shutdowns, depleted employee markets and ongoing inflation. With that, 2023 is the year for SMB owners to further embrace marketing automation, learning to better optimize their technology and business processes to not only remain competitive but to stand out and outpace the competition.\n\nHere are four marketing automation trends for SMBs to implement to make a splash in 2023.\n\nRelated: Use These Two Tactics to Make Your Customer Experience Stand Out in 2023\n\nToday's customers don't just want a personalized experience, they expect it. A recent McKinsey study found that 71% of consumers expect companies to deliver personalized interactions. Personalized customer experiences have long been an area of opportunity for SMBs, and the explosion of digital channels and the migration of consumers online shouldn't change that. In 2023, it simply will not be enough to add a customer's name to an email subject line or trigger discount emails on their birthday. But, with the right marketing automation tools, marketers can gain the knowledge and tools to adequately cater to the right audiences.\n\nBy tracking customers' website and email engagement -- as well as other content assets -- with marketing automation, SMBs can determine different customers' pain points and needs. This helps marketers understand what content engages what audiences, and enables them to adjust copy, images or frequency of different marketing channels to improve engagement metrics. And, employees can use sales and customer support engagement data to gain an even deeper understanding of customer needs.\n\nWith this knowledge, SMBs can better segment different audiences and scale different automated email workflows with relevant content and formats that is proven to engage that specific audience. Then, with the right marketing automation software, teams can create triggered responses that automatically send additional funnel-optimized content based on how the prospect interacts with that email. Through automation, SMBs can quickly funnel relevant content in the form of on-demand webinars, whitepapers, video content or schedule follow-up phone calls and meetings. This enables small, resource-constrained marketing teams to guide prospects through an entire sales journey in a fraction of the time.\n\nThe appeal of marketing automation software for SMBs began because of the tech's ability to improve marketing reach. However, SMBs must now look to better understand and utilize the wealth of information gathered from their marketing software. With the reach finding that data-driven organizations are three times more likely to improve in strategic decision-making, the ability to capture and capitalize on valuable data will be top of mind for SMB owners in 2023.\n\nThrough marketing automation, SMBs can easily track the activity on different communications channels. This enables teams to not only gather intel on customer behaviors but monitor how different marketing campaigns and messages are performing with audiences. And, powerful marketing automation platforms come with testing tools, like a/b testing, that allow marketers to adjust and fine-tune email and web messaging and campaign designs. With marketing automation's data tracking and testing, SMBs can simplify data analysis and improve decision-making through knowledge-based findings.\n\nRelated: The Big Risks You Need to Avoid When Using Marketing Automation\n\nEffective lead generation and nurturing are critical aspects of sales and business growth. Lead nurturing -- once a labor-intensive endeavor -- has become a simplified and streamlined process thanks to marketing automation.\n\nWith automated tools, SMBs can continue to eliminate repetitive, time-consuming manual tasks on all fronts -- especially within the sales funnel. With intuitive marketing automation platforms, even a novice designer can easily create engaging, high-converting and on-brand landing pages equipped with lead capture forms to collect customer email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nSMBs looking to take lead capturing to the next level can integrate their marketing automation with their customer relationship management (CRM) software.

                    "title": "How Small Businesses Can Work And Leverage Influencer Marketing In 2023",
                    "body": "It's time that small and medium-sized businesses harness the prowess of influencer marketing, and the proof is in the pudding.\n\nAccording to an Inc. report published last year, around 46% of surveyed consumers claim to have bought a product or service that was promoted or affiliated by an influencer. An even higher percentage, around 62% of respondents said that they have engaged with sponsored posts on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nInfluencers are bringing the products and services consumers want directly to them, and they have the audience numbers to prove their success. Another survey by proprietary eCommerce platform giant, Shopify, shows that 61% of consumers trust influencers' recommendations.\n\nBut why are influencers so successful, and what's their secret?\n\nFor starters, influencers have spent years garnering a loyal band of online and social media followers, and these consumers trust their recommendations and opinions once they partner with a specific brand.\n\nInfluencers have become online and digital friends who suggest a specific product or item, only for you to fully trust their authority, reach out to the company and purchase it. 69% of consumers in a recent poll were likely to trust a friend, family member, or influencer over the information they receive from them.\n\nAnd companies are cashing in big time. Figures from 2018 suggest that businesses and companies generate at least $6.50 for every $1.00 they spend or invest in influencer marketing.\n\nIt's not just a marketing gimmick anymore, and putting a trusted, and authoritative figure next to your line of products and services can almost certainly guarantee a return on capital investment. That is if you know what you're doing and how to work with influencers.\n\nDespite the positivity surrounding influencer marketing, it's nothing new to mainstream digital marketing strategies, and corporate brands have for years been leveraging these tactics to increase brand awareness and boost revenue through sales.\n\nIn the United States, around three-quarters of marketers will use some sort of influencer marketing tactic this year, with experts suggesting these figures to increase even more in the years to come.\n\nWhether we want to admit it or not, influencer marketing works, and it's helping companies reach more potential buyers, and putting their products right in front of them.\n\nIn the past, corporate brands and companies utilized celebrities for marketing campaigns, and while this worked, for some time, the rapid rise of social media and online platforms quickly replaced them with trendy influencers who have amassed thousands of followers.\n\nToday, social media influencers are everywhere online, and companies, both big and small are seeing improved engagement, better sales, and more brand awareness with the aid of their expertise on both the product and how to sell it to their followers.\n\nAsk any business owner or entrepreneur, and they'll tell you how difficult it is to get their products and services to the right people. Luckily with the internet, and widespread social media adoption, companies now can reach audiences that are within and outside of their locale.\n\nThe digital economy now thrives on the internet, and using influencer marketing alongside existing digital marketing strategies can help any small or medium-scale business build up the recognition it requires.\n\nStarting a new campaign, and with the help of an influencer is no easy caveat, and there's a lot to consider. Here's a rundown of what you as a business owner or entrepreneur can do to better leverage influencers and influencer marketing this year.\n\nTo start, understand the product or service you're selling, and who your target market is. If you're looking to reach a younger consumer market, it's best to look for influencers that typically have a more youthful following.\n\nYour product needs to be something consumers want to purchase, more so, it should answer a specific need or desire. If it's simply another type of energy drink or coffee brand, which there are countless of, then you're going to have to rethink your branding and marketing strategy to align with your business goals.\n\nConsider how your product or service will answer the needs of your targeted audience, and align this with a specific influencer that resonates well with your brand.\n\nCollaborating with influencers is never an easy task. For starters, these individuals have spent years building a personal brand and online presence that has allowed them to become an authoritative figure within the social ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding what influencers want and what their requirements mean that you as a business owner or entrepreneur will need to work with individuals that resonate with your brand, and share the same vision you might have.\n\nYou want to ensure that the people who market and sell your products are those that have experience and knowledge of your industry.\n\nIt would almost be meaningless to sell a self-charging electric car with the help of a fashion influencer or food blogger. Make sure that you understand who their followers are and whether this meets your target audience goals.\n\nAdditionally, you want to make sure that the content you share or use is meaningful and can drive engagement.\n\nWhile you may be collaborating with an influencer, it would seem meaningless if your content strategy is not effective enough to drive the results you're looking for.\n\nDuring the onboarding process, or while you're still looking for an influencer to work with, it's best to consider how your current content will fit the brand of the influencer and your business. In line with this, you will need to consider how the product or service you're trying to sell can be marketed in a way that will drive more traffic to your website or online shop.\n\nInfluencers typically have a content or marketing strategy they use to market certain products, and during the planning process, make sure to have a collaborative vision that combines both your strategy and that of the influencers you're looking to work with.\n\nDue to the ongoing success of influencer marketing, companies have continued increasing their marketing budgets over the years, with the majority stake being allocated to influencer marketing.\n\nResearch from 2021 suggests that marketers borrowed more than 80% of the overall marketing budget, at the expense of other marketing channels to fund influencer marketing campaigns.\n\nSimilarly to this, more than 61% of marketers said they were planning to raise marketing or influencer marketing budgets in 2021 after witnessing growing success and high rates of following engagement online.\n\nWhile it's hard to calculate how much businesses end up spending running influencer marketing campaigns, it's essential to know that this sort of marketing strategy will cost a pretty penny, so it's well worth your time to budget accordingly.\n\nThe price will typically be influenced by several factors, including influencer demand, following, audience reach and engagement, exclusivity, and brand awareness. This will give you a better idea of how much you're going to spend on influencer marketing.\n\nAnd remember, just because someone has a lot of followers, doesn't mean they have high levels of follower engagement.\n\nKnown as the three important components of influence - relevance, reach, and resonance - as a business owner it's important to build a strategy that encapsulates all three of these areas.\n\nThe first, relevance, requires you to deliver a marketing strategy that is both relevant to your business and the industry. Additionally, it should be relevant to your target audience, and the influencer you're looking to collaborate with.\n\nSecondly, it's important to look at who you could potentially reach through an influencer's followers. A small audience may be effective, but it will need to deliver the engagement results you're looking for and the possible return on investment.\n\nThe third component - resonance - sees the level of engagement an influencer will have with their followers when using your product or service. The better an influencer resonates with a particular brand, the easier it will be for their following to engage with potential buyers.\n\nInfluencer marketing can be complicated at first, and there are a lot of challenges that you as a business owner will first need to resolve before you can successfully run an influencer marketing campaign.\n\nAside from the known challenges, it's best to constantly monitor the rate of success, to ensure you are gaining the exposure you desire, and that your marketing budget is being spent to boost interaction and drive traffic to your company.\n\nIt's never easy to fully understand how to handle influencers or how to work with them, but if you know your product and your brand, it almost becomes a lot easier to know exactly the type of people you want representing your brand online.\n\nPublished First on ValueWalk.

                    "body": "Here are some tips to ensure your company stays afloat with marketing strategies during a possible recession in 2023,\n\n1) Focus on your target market: During the recession, focusing on your core customer base is important which means identifying your most profitable customers and tailoring your marketing efforts to reach them specifically, said Amitek Sinha, COO & Co-Founder, ET Medialabs. \"Consider offering promotions or discounts to loyal customers to encourage them to continue doing business with you.\"\n\n2) Invest in digital marketing: Sinha said that it is an end-to-end measurable and cost-effective way to reach a wide audience. \"Use social media, performance marketing, branding, email marketing, and other digital channels to communicate with your customers and promote your products or services.\"\n\n\"As more people spend time online during a recession, companies should invest in digital marketing which includes SEO, PPC advertising, social media advertising, and other digital tactics,\" said Vipin Vindal, CEO, Quarks Technosoft.\n\n3) Leverage partnerships and collaborations: \"Partnering with other businesses can help you reach new audiences and expand your customer base. Consider collaborating with other businesses in your industry or adjacent industries to offer bundled products or services,\" ET Medialabs cofounder said.\n\n4) Build brand awareness: During a recession, consumers may be more hesitant to make purchases from unfamiliar brands, so it's important for companies to build brand awareness. This can be done through social media, content marketing, influencer marketing, and other tactics that help get the word out about the company, said Quarks Technosoft CEO.\n\n5) Invest in customer delight: \"In a recession, customers are more likely to be discerning with their spending. By investing in exceptional customer delight, you can create a positive experience for your customers and encourage them to continue doing business with you,\" Sinha suggested.\n\n6) Offer discounts and promotions: Consumers are more likely to be looking for deals and promotions at the time of recession, so companies should consider offering them. This can be done through email marketing, social media, and other channels, Vindal recommended.\n\n7) Focus on the value proposition: \"Consumers tend to be more price-sensitive, so companies should focus on highlighting their value proposition. This means emphasizing the benefits and features of their products or services that make them a better value than competitors,\" the Quarks Technosoft CEO added.\n\n8) Leverage customer reviews and referrals: Word-of-mouth marketing is one of the most effective forms of marketing, especially during a recession. Companies can encourage their customers to leave reviews on third-party websites like Yelp or Google Reviews, and offer incentives for referrals, Vindal said.\n\n9) Focus on customer priorities: First and foremost, companies must be agile and should have the ability to pivot their products and services offered to align with the changing priorities due to recessionary pressure. The message one communicates to prospects or customers through marketing must be aligned with customers' priorities, said Prabir Chetia, Executive Vice President - Growth Advisory, Aranca.\n\n\"Messages must reflect the value accrued - enhanced quality or getting more from less - and clearly articulate the benefits aligned with priorities. In the case of a loyal customer, one has to go the extra mile to demonstrate value to ensure they don't switch.\"\n\n10) Build brand awareness: Consumers may be more hesitant to make purchases from unfamiliar brands, so it's important for companies to build brand awareness. This can be done through social media, content marketing, influencer marketing, and other tactics that help get the word out about the company, according to Vipin Vindal.",

                    "body": "Upon evaluation of the current state of performance marketing, it is evident that consumer brands are on a mission to maximize their digital footprint and increase conversions through innovative and efficient marketing strategies.\n\nIn addition, the economy hasn't been fair; so, with a tight grip on budgets, brands are shifting their focus to quantification and marketing analytics, utilizing AI tools to demonstrate the financial impact of their investments.\n\nAs performance marketing converges with brand marketing, we can expect to see a new level of creativity and innovation in these spaces. The future looks bright, and the possibilities are endless. Here, we discuss the major trends driving performance marketing in 2023.\n\nThe growing number of digital touchpoints and channels that consumers use to interact with brands has increased the need for consumer brands to maximize conversions across each touchpoint. It seems like every other day, a new social media app is going viral, each of which presents an opportunity to engage audiences dynamically.\n\nIn addition, consumers may start their purchasing journey on one channel and then switch to another before making a purchase, so it's crucial for brands to ensure that their marketing efforts are optimized for each touchpoint to drive conversions.\n\nBecause performance marketing focuses on driving specific, measurable results, such as conversions, sales, or leads, it is an ideal approach for consumer brands looking to maximize conversions across multiple digital touchpoints.\n\nIn the aftermath of COVID-19, Gartner reports that marketing budgets seem to be making a rebound, having risen to 9.5% of revenues in 2022. However, recovery is slow and has failed to hit pre-pandemic levels. While there is hope for more progress in 2023, many marketing executives are still in caution mode.\n\nAs a cautious approach, performance marketing provides more immediate and quantifiable results, making it a more attractive option for companies looking to maximize their return on investment in a challenging economic environment.\n\nIn this scenario, companies are more likely to allocate their limited marketing budget to tactics that have a direct impact on sales and revenue, while brand-building initiatives that may have a longer-term but delayed impact take the backseat (temporarily).\n\nThe trend toward performance marketing has created a high demand for professionals with skills in this area. As Wall Street Journal reports, more companies are hiring senior marketers and CMOs with experience in performance marketing and data analytics. In addition, according to a survey by Marketing Week, performance marketing (20.2%) is among the top four roles with over 20% increase in hiring.\n\nAs a performance marketer, one must have a deep understanding of digital marketing channels, such as search engines, social media, and email, and be able to use analytics and tracking tools to measure the impact of their campaigns.\n\nBecause companies are now acknowledging that performance marketing is a key driver of success in the digital age, they are looking for people who can effectively leverage performance-driven approaches to achieve business goals.\n\nThe demand for performance marketers also reflects the increasing need for data-driven predictions and decision-making in marketing. Performance marketing relies heavily on data and analytics, and brands are looking for marketers and leaders who can use this data to make informed decisions and continuously optimize their campaigns. On the other hand, brand marketing, while it may have measurable reports, is geared towards more qualitative results, such as reputation management, awareness, credibility, public relations, and so on.\n\nAI-powered tools can help companies track, analyze, and optimize their marketing efforts in real-time, providing valuable insights into consumer behavior and campaign performance. Also, AI and marketing analytics tools are now available to companies of all sizes today. Any business can automate manual processes and track performance metrics in no time. In fact, statistics show that 95% of companies now use integrate AI-powered analytics into their marketing strategy.\n\nIn recent years, brand marketing has been the dominant approach in the marketing industry, with a focus on building brand awareness and image. Even now, there remains a consistent emphasis on marketing your brand. However, with the rise of digital marketing and the increasing focus on quantifiable results, performance marketing seems to be on a path of convergence with brand marketing, rather than taking over the game entirely.\n\nThis convergence is happening as companies realize that building a strong brand is not enough on its own to drive sales and meet business objectives. On the other hand, focusing on conversion metrics to the detriment of long-term brand sustenance is not healthy.\n\nAccording to Jeff Weiser, a former marketing executive at Shopify Inc., \"brands won't succeed if they \"try to turn marketing exclusively into ones and zeros.\" Combining the benefits of brand marketing with the data-driven approach of performance marketing creates a more holistic and effective marketing strategy.\n\nIn the end, companies must always be willing to take calculated risks and think outside the box to stay ahead of the competition. This could mean embracing emerging technologies, exploring new marketing channels, or developing unique content strategies. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver a seamless, integrated customer experience that drives results and gives customers a reason to come back.",

                    "body": "An unpopular Chinese proverb goes thus: \"If you want one year of prosperity, grow grain. If you want 10 years of prosperity, grow trees. If you want 100 years of prosperity, grow people.\"\n\nA sustainable business cannot focus on making money alone without creating a community of customers. Time and resources must be invested to build a community that will keep the business waxing strong especially when global economies fail. Email marketing is the fastest way to develop such a community.\n\nAs a developer myself, I have come to appreciate the returns on email marketing and when I share these statistics with friends, business owners and marketers, they find it quite difficult to believe. Yet, one of the oldest communication tools in the world still provides better results than social media and any other digital marketing strategy.\n\nEmail marketing is simply sending emails to create awareness for a product or service to a targeted audience. At least 306 billion emails are sent and received each day as of the year 2021. By 2024, the numbers would naturally have increased.\n\nEmail marketing is still the most popular and effective strategy for marketers to reach their audiences. A survey conducted by Hubspot revealed that 47.5 percent of marketers said their email marketing strategy was more effective toward reaching their business goals.\n\nBefore we go further into the technical aspect of email marketing, I will highlight some of its benefits. A single email from a business can be sent to over a thousand people and read by more than 60 percent of that number due to open and click rates being higher than social media or other marketing strategies.\n\nHow does this happen? It's quite simple. Emails are more personal and targeted to a specific audience than social media posts and other affordable means of communication and marketing. There are no issues about a platform's algorithm because the email list will always belong to the business.\n\nSo, all one needs to do is create a list, verify these leads through Tribearc's mail platform, engage and nurture one's customers by writing simple emails sent directly to their inboxes through email automation. Applying useful APIs, webhooks, even using a free email marketing copy can help make the email more interesting to read.\n\nEmail marketing is not just sending a creative newsletter to an email list of subscribers. It goes further into subscriber segmentation. As soon as you begin to study the analysis from the tool, you can easily identify what works better for your customer, how they can easily scale through the sales funnel and directly increase your revenue.\n\nI will be hosting business experts, developers, communicators and tech enthusiasts to a webinar on email marketing to educate people on leveraging artificial intelligence to write powerful emails, email segmentation and deliverability, email marketing campaign measurement amongst other important tips.",

                    "title": "How embracing 'Be all you can be' resurrected Army marketing",
                    "body": "CHICAGO -- After the Great Fire ravaged this city in 1871, the phoenix became an unofficial symbol of its rebirth and swift rebuilding.\n\nThe immortal mythological bird, which regenerates by bursting into flames and rising anew from its own ashes, featured prominently on tickets to the 1893 World's Fair held here.\n\nIn a nondescript federal building downtown -- on a block that burned 152 years ago -- the Army Enterprise Marketing Office rose anew from the ashes of its predecessors in an office suite with the Constitution laser-etched into its windows by an unknown previous tenant.\n\nAfter announcing the enterprise office in 2019, the Army invested millions to establish and equip it in a major marketing city, started a new high-dollar contract with a new leading advertising agency and developed new career paths for officers to \"translate\" the Army to the advertising community and American public.\n\nAnd the recent rollout of a \"reinvented\" classic recruiting slogan -- \"Be all you can be\" -- marks a milestone that officials argued proves the concepts underpinning the Chicago office. The slogan proved so successful that the Army used it from 1981 through 2001.\n\nAnd despite the resurgence of mullets and mustaches among Gen Z youth, officials insist the vintage tagline won't be a nostalgia tour. They say its victory in a long-planned research and testing process reflects the possibilities it embodies rather than warm feelings from a bygone era.\n\nThe rebrand is the latest move in a series of service-wide efforts that may reduce recent years' recruiting struggles, which reached a new nadir in fiscal 2022 when the Army missed its active-duty recruiting goal by 15,000 troops.\n\nTo retrace the rebirth of the service's marketing, Army Times visited the enterprise office in Chicago in mid-February ahead of the rebrand rollout. Army Times also interviewed current and former marketing officials, reviewed audit reports and records associated with the office's doomed predecessors and obtained other documents on Army marketing strategy and practice.\n\nBut will it burn again?\n\nThe enterprise marketing office emerged in 2019 from the wreckage of the Army Marketing Research Group, a Pentagon-based predecessor that collapsed amid scandal that year.\n\nThe research group formed to assume the Army's marketing responsibilities months before the inactivation of Accessions Command, home to the service's existing marketing efforts, in 2012.\n\nBut the effort was seemingly -- or at least symbolically -- ill-fated from the start.\n\nA transition planning meeting between Accessions Command personnel, the service's various advertising and marketing contractors, and top officials for the new marketing research office took place on a high floor of the aging Hoffman Towers in Alexandria, Virginia, on August 23, 2011.\n\n\"Ten minutes into the meeting, the room started shaking -- knocking pictures off the wall,\" recounted Bruce Jasurda, then chief marketing officer for Accessions Command. \"So we all ended up evacuating and stood in the parking lot for an hour and a half.\"\n\nAlthough the cracks that day's magnitude 5.8 earthquake left in the Washington Monument were quickly noticed, the marketing research office's struggles burst onto the scene starting in late 2017 as three advertising conglomerates competed for the service's lucrative advertising contract, valued between $1 and $4 billion.\n\nA series of stories in the advertising industry magazine Adweek revealed that a director in the marketing research group danced with and kissed an executive from McCann Worldgroup, then the contract-holder, at a concert following an October 2017 strategy meeting where Army officials purportedly gave inside information to McCann staffers to boost their bidding process. The Army relieved the official, marketing director James Ortiz, who later retired. The McCann executive resigned.\n\nThen the Army's internal accountants sounded the alarm: the marketing research group was, \"ineffective,\" they said, and a draft audit obtained by Adweek in January 2018 questioned more than $930 million in marketing spending that \"potentially didn't provide the best value to support Army recruiting.\"\n\nCongress intervened via the fiscal 2019 defense policy bill, blocking half of the service's marketing funds until the Army finished a plan to fix the problems.\n\nAnd after advertising heavyweight Omnicom's DDB agency won the new marketing contract, the Army shuttered the marketing research group in 2019.\n\nThat's also when the service announced the new enterprise marketing agency, which installed a uniformed chief marketer -- Maj. Gen. Alex Fink.\n\nFink, an Army Reserve officer with civilian marketing experience, spoke with Army Times in a series of phone interviews. He described the first phase of his task as \"catching up\" Army marketing \"with where the industry is and what you can do in marketing.\"\n\nThe Army first needed him to set up the new Chicago office, which the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted and turned into a daunting task. The pandemic may have forced the rest of the Army to embrace collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams that keep the Chicago-based team in touch with stakeholders in the Pentagon, Army Recruiting Command and beyond.\n\nBut Fink believes their proximity to their advertising agency, which is also based in Chicago, outweighs any difficulties that arose from their relative isolation.\n\nCol. John Horning, the office's marketing strategy director, embodies another major effort that Fink and officials from West Point's Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis spearheaded -- creating a marketing career functional area for officers and finding untapped talent hiding in the service's ranks.\n\nBetween December 2019 and October 2022, nearly 80 mid-career officers were hired for the field out of 750 applicants, according to a document obtained by Army Times. Of the selected officers, more than eight in ten have in-residence graduate degrees. The functional area's entry guidelines call for a top master's of business administration or graduate education in behavioral economics or similar social science. Those who don't yet have such degrees submit scores on graduate entry tests and selectees go to school on the Army's dime.\n\nOfficers with substantial civilian marketing experience are also eligible. Enter Horning.\n\nThe former armor officer followed an unconventional path to Chicago. Commissioned via West Point in the 1990s, Horning left after his five-year service commitment and worked in brand advertising first for multinational corporation Procter & Gamble and then a German beer company. But after the Sept. 11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq, Horning wanted to serve again, so he joined the National Guard.\n\nFollowing a Guard combat deployment, Horning transferred back to the active-duty force and commanded a cavalry squadron. In mid-2019, he learned about the enterprise marketing office but wanted to finish his tour as an observer/controller trainer at Fort Polk, Louisiana. When he learned about the new career field a few months later, he applied and soon found himself in Chicago at the enterprise office.\n\nFink, Horning and the career field's architects argue that soldier-led marketing efforts were -- and will be -- key to the new office getting results for the Army. Its officers are expected to draw upon their military experience and leverage their civilian education or background to act as interpreters.\n\nThey said having officers steeped in civilian marketing best practices sets the enterprise office apart from its predecessors and laid the foundation for the brand refresh.\n\nJasurda, the former top marketer in Accessions Command, agrees.\n\n\"I think it's such a fantastic concept to hire trained marketing professionals [to work] hand-in-hand and close by their agency partners to reemphasize all of the attributed that made 'Be all you can be' successful,\" the former Army officer, who worked in a marketing role in the 1980s before returning in 2008 as a civilian, said.\n\nFink added that through their roles as contracting officer representatives, marketing officers directly participate in translating the Army's needs into contract requirements for the agency, and they also help Army leaders understand how advertising and marketing work.\n\nThe general said involving such officers in the contract planning process has reduced the need for time-consuming and inefficient volumes of task orders, which are individualized work requests to contractors. Auditors faulted the legacy marketing research group for an overreliance on task orders.\n\nAuditors, lawmakers and Army leaders also directed the enterprise office to improve its ability to trace recruiting leads back to specific marketing efforts.\n\n\"We had 0% attribution when [the enterprise office] started,\" explained Horning. \"We didn't have the ability to tell you anything, and there was nothing handed over.\" Now the office can trace around 30% of leads registered on GoArmy.com thanks to quick surveys and industry-standard advances in advertising tracking technology.\n\nHe acknowledged that perfect attribution is impossible, nor is it an exact science. That's where the enterprise marketing office's marketing officers, its Army civilian data scientists and the agency's experts come into play.\n\nOne tool is their marketing mix model, which helps the office make quarterly adjustments to where it advertises and markets. The statistical model analyzes attributed leads against advertising and marketing costs to help the office find those that are punching above their weight and reduce those that aren't.\n\n\"We've gotten our overall [marketing] cost-per-contract from [$36,000] when we took over...[down] to now roughly around $12,000 just by being able to look at the actual performance of those media channels,\" Horning said, hailing efficiency improvements.\n\nAsked for examples, he said the reviews led the service to reduce its investment in online banner advertisements and instead double down on sponsored search results.\n\nHorning said building quantitative expertise and embracing a data-centric culture also helped the enterprise office develop a more nuanced understanding of the audience segments that make up the office's targets.\n\nAudience segment research, an industry-wide tactic, groups portions of the population into demographic subgroups -- defined through combinations of age, class, race, gender and geography, among other data points -- and identifies what marketing or advertising approach and message is best for reaching them.\n\nThe enterprise office's research identified and profiled 11 unique segments of age-eligible Americans, the colonel added. Factors such as segment size, preferred messaging mode and the marketing mix model come into play when figuring out how to reach them, but the goal is the same for each -- \"getting the right message to the right person, but also making sure that of those right persons, there's enough of them.\"\n\nThis capability exists at an unprecedented scale within the enterprise office compared to its predecessor, Fink said, meaning the Army is better positioned to understand and control the contractor's capabilities. \"They didn't necessarily have people in their organization that really could drive this...I don't think data performance was a thing, quite frankly, for the last organization.\"\n\nNow armed with its data infrastructure, the enterprise office is undertaking its most ambitious project yet: reimagining the Army's entire brand.\n\nOfficials said a brand refresh was always in the office's plans, but it took time and repetitions with the interim \"What's Your Warrior\" campaign and other efforts like \"The Calling,\" widely attacked by conservative pundits, to help calibrate their tactics and understanding of how stakeholders would react to different projects.\n\n\"What's Your Warrior,\" which aimed to showcase the Army's myriad career fields, turned some prospects off with its martial tone, Horning said. But \"The Calling,\" an animated series that featured individual troops' enlistment stories, came under right-wing attack for a spot featuring a corporal who grew up with two mothers.\n\n\"Even with the Calling, we found that there was a prospect audience that absolutely identified [with it], but we're all very aware that it struck a nerve,\" Horning said. \"Some other people didn't identify with what we were trying to do, and it became a distraction.\"\n\nSo when it came time to start researching the Army's next tagline and foundation for a brand refresh, \"we were adamant about making sure that the work we're doing...resonated with each of the stakeholder communities and was going to be something that everyone can get behind,\" Horning said.\n\nBoth Maj. David Huffman, the officer who oversaw much of the \"Be all you can be\" reinvention, and Fink told Army Times that the enterprise office started with \"over 200'' taglines before narrowing the list down to around 20 semifinalists that proceeded to audience testing.\n\nThe process surveyed 14,000 people across five stakeholder groups, Huffman explained. \"The Army brand is bigger than just prospects and influencers... [it] belongs to prospects, influencers, the soldiers who wear the uniform, veterans [and] the American people.\"\n\nThe testing went beyond cursory surveys and A/B tests and included fully-developed logos and other mock products for each tagline that \"went back to the original brand research that identified some of the brand opportunities,\" the major said.\n\nAfter testing, Fink's team presented three top-scoring finalists to the service's senior leaders in spring 2021. \"Be all you can be\" was the clear winner, he said, thanks to its open-ended applicability to prospects' individual lives and historical resonance with veterans and current soldiers.\n\nBut it's not about nostalgia, he cautioned. The general described the launch as a \"reinvention\" of the classic tagline.\n\nFink argued that in the 1980s, the tagline reflected \"a time of a lot of optimism\" within the Army and the general public. Now, \"Be all you can be\" (emphasis his), seeks to cut through the anxiety and uncertainty of the post-pandemic era and show young Americans the possibilities the service offers.\n\nThe first round of advertising hits the airwaves this week, and experiential marketing events will also feature at the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament in Houston at the end of March.\n\nHuffman described the tagline as a foundation or vehicle chassis that, once established, offers a base for the Army to customize future campaigns targeting different audience segments.\n\n\"Upcoming campaigns that we have currently in the works will build on that foundation and start to get into some of those key messages in the world,\" Huffman said. \"Some of the creative [advertising content] will start to dive into individual segmentation-focused messaging.\"\n\nAll hands involved realize that the brand relaunch is not the culmination of the Army's enterprise marketing rebirth, but rather the beginning of a new phase.\n\n\"I think that the organization has the opportunity to really reenter what has been basically a 10-year hiatus of talking to prospects in the way they want to be talked to, with the people they want to talk to, in the mediums they want to be talked to in,\" Jasurda, the former top marketer for now-defunct Accessions Command said. \"And that's a hard job, even for somebody like Fink.\"\n\nFink agreed though he won't be there to see it through. After nearly three years at the helm, he retires this summer.\n\n\"This is a career-culminating experience,\" he said in reflection. \"I'm just really grateful for the opportunity to lead this team of Army marketers at this point in time in the Army's history. I could have never planned this in my career.\"\n\nIt's not clear yet who his successor will be, but his staff is ready to keep the momentum going.\n\nHorning said the office is hard at work on the campaign that will follow the relaunch of \"Be all you can be,\" estimating that it will arrive in August.\n\nBut he'll take a moment to enjoy the first rounds of the rebrand first.\n\n\"I'm particularly happy with the initial pieces of creative that I have seen,\" said the colonel. He said audiences should look closely for an \"Easter egg...that honors the original 'Be all you can be.'\"",

                    "body": "Alice Sharma, Associate Director - Brand Solutions, ARM Worldwide\n\nIn recent years, Indian women have been at the forefront of marketing, breaking barriers and shattering stereotypes along the way. What was earlier considered a male-dominated industry is now equally grown by both men and women, with a rise of 36% in women leaders in the marketing industry. Drawing on their creative and technological strengths, women like Ritu Nazir, Priya Nair, Rajashree R., and more have inspired other women in the marketing sector to make valuable contributions.\n\nFemale representation in the marketing sector has become strong in the past few years. Recent reports highlight that around 27% of women are seeking roles in the marketing and social media domain, 18% in PR and communications, and around 14% in account management.\n\nIn the marketing industry, it is key for a person to have creative skills. According to a study, it was revealed that women tend to have stronger marketing skills as compared to men. Hence, that is one of the reasons why women are opting for marketing as their choice of career. They are now unleashing their potential by setting foot in an industry that demands creativity.\n\nFocusing just on targets with a narrow vision in marketing products and services is a thing of the past. With a drastic shift in the industry, the domain demands enterprising, and that is where women are getting the edge. Women tend to be more enterprising and reliable as compared to men. Women tend to bring skills like compassion, respect, and ethics that shift the workplace culture.\n\nMarketing jobs are projected to continually increase, with companies looking at different ways to establish and grow their presence both online as well as offline. Since the marketing profession is continually growing, women professionals with a degree in marketing would always be in high demand.\n\nTalking about India, women have been making significant strides in the marketing industry, with many of them taking on predominant leadership roles. There are numerous Indian women in the marketing industry from whom we can get inspired each day, like Sunita Bangard (CMO of Hutchison Essar South Ltd.), Deepa Harris (Deputy of Marketing at Amazon India), Pooja Johari (CEO of The Glitch), Tanya Dubash (Chief Brand Officer of Godrej Group) among others.",

                    "body": "This blog is a part of a series highlighting the perspectives of partner marketing executives across the globe. You'll hear our guest writers' experiences facing challenges in the partner ecosystem and their insights from their years of experience.\n\nWhen I tell people that I work in partner marketing, I am often met with looks of confusion, particularly in general social settings. But we're partner marketers and we know what it means, right? I tell people to think about it like this: I help all the great companies that work with mine sell more products and services. We play a critical role within the partner ecosystem and partners regularly look to us to be the expert when it comes to our company's products and how to market them.\n\nPartner marketing can take many shapes and forms - whether that be building and driving bespoke 1:1 strategies and plans in conjunction with a select group of larger strategic partners, or providing a scalable model for smaller, local partners that are sometimes managed by distributors.\n\nSo, how do you take a partner marketing strategy from good to great?\n\nIt all starts with a strong team that should focus on providing partners with simple, self-service and co-brandable content on your partner portal. Simpler is always better, especially since most smaller partners have limited resources and sometimes are comprised of interns, a single marketing manager or even a sales leader who moonlights as a marketer on the side. They don't have time to run big marketing campaigns.\n\nWhen looking to build a 1:1 bespoke campaign, make sure that partner marketing has a seat at the table from the start. It's incredibly important to be \"in the room\" when partners are building their go-to-market strategy with your company. There should be a team that includes Partner Sales, Marketing and technical resources from both companies. When Marketing is included from the start, it allows us to build a plan that aligns to the goals of the relationship and ensures that set targets and objectives are met.\n\nOnce the strategy is in place, you can attack the funnel from every which way, whether that be the top, bottom or middle. Our job is not just to build the pipeline, but also to help accelerate and close it. There are many different tactics that can be implemented depending on the goals of the partnership.\n\nIf you're starting a new relationship with a partner, you need to ask yourself: \"What do you know?\" Build a key messaging document that identifies your target audiences, including personas, industries, business size and more. Look to answer questions like: What problems are you solving for the customer? and How do you differentiate your messaging from your competition? The messaging you create is key and nothing beats a customer testimonial - hands down. Make sure your sales team is working on getting that commitment from customers from the start. You may want to have an account map planning session and with that you can create some account-based marketing (ABM) campaigns targeting those identified accounts. This is where digital marketing is a great tactic to implement. You can reach a broader audience at a lower cost to build the top of your marketing funnel.\n\nOnce you are further along in your strategy and have a solid pipeline, now is the time to accelerate that pipeline. You need to help create those \"collision points\" in the field. These are opportunities for your customer pipeline to meet with your sales teams, other customers, third-party influencers and executives. This can happen by hosting an event on your own or looking for industry events, such as tradeshows, where you know both parties will be in attendance. This can be a great stage - both literally and figuratively - in the marketing funnel to share evidence as to why your company is the best to work with. When possible, include proof points from analyst papers and customer references. Always remember, it's not about selling the product, but selling the value the customer will receive from the solution.\n\nFinally, while you can enjoy the event (and I always do), don't forget about the close! Smaller, more intimate C-level events are the most influential event you can hold. Make sure you have a satisfied customer in attendance at these events. Customers are usually more comfortable once they hear from a peer about a successful launch of a new product or solution and the benefits they saw when using it. This creates an environment for potential customers to open up and ask questions and feel comfortable with the answers.\n\nAs marketers, we know that all these tactics must be happening at the same time to keep the pipeline flowing and are not implemented as one-off activities. When budget, headcount or time is constrained, make sure your team understands the impact this will have on the pipeline. Speaking of pipeline, all of these activities should and will drive pipeline - and showing pipeline is the value our team brings. Make sure you are always tracking and reporting the ROI - and communicate this consistently. When done correctly, it can even get you more headcount and budget.\n\nIf you walk away with only one nugget here, know that marketing must have a seat at the table from the start and communicating the value we can bring is priceless. At the end of the day, we want sales teams to view Marketing as a valuable tool (or secret weapon) that they rely on and think of their partner marketing manager as their dedicated CMO.",

                    "body": "This blog is a part of a series highlighting the perspectives of partner marketing executives across the globe. You'll hear our guest writers' experiences facing challenges in the partner ecosystem and their insights from their years of experience.\n\nDramatic performances used to be nowhere but on a stage in front of a live audience. Then, advancement led to technology so audiences could experience entertainment through movies and movie theaters. Over time, movies were accessible in the comfort of your home, through home video. Video stores arrived and viewers could rent new and hard-to-find movies. Today, it's available at our fingertips, delivered to the device of our choosing.\n\nThe user experience went from exclusively in-person performances to a myriad of options.\n\nMany of us live this every day. The internet, online shopping, mobile technologies and public/private/hybrid cloud computing have changed the world. Artificial intelligence, blockchain and edge technologies appear to be the next foundations for innovation.\n\nThat's innovation: taking a capability, not settling for what it is, but being purposeful about what it could be. It fuels progress. It pushes our boundaries and improves our experience. With all this innovation around us, why are we in strategic alliance marketing so quick to revert to standard marketing approaches for new and innovative alliances?\n\nBusiness is changing, technology is changing, customers are changing - it's time for strategic alliance marketing to adapt.\n\nIf you're not innovating in how you market with your strategic alliances, you're only seeing a fraction of the benefits and return your marketing efforts could yield. Settling for status quo in alliance marketing is, more-often-than-not, settling for mediocrity in business returns.\n\nRaise your hand if you've ever been in this situation: A new strategic alliance has been negotiated. Engineers engage each other, sellers get connected in field - there's excitement in the air! Marketing plans are created and executives are briefed ... all capped off by an amazing launch!\n\nAnd yet, results are flat, which is followed by email after email and meeting after meeting to discuss where the problem areas are and how to adjust.\n\nBeing fully aware that numerous factors drive the success of a new alliance, let's turn our attention to the marketing part of the equation. If an idea is revolutionary to the market, doesn't it stand to reason that markets will move with new approaches to marketing?\n\nWhen it comes to success in strategic alliances, there are some important basics - the first of which is to build to a structure, similar in some ways to roadmap or revenue plan.\n\nCollaboration between strategic alliances is key at this stage. Agreeing on metrics, abiding by a strategy and consenting to pivots are critical to achieving the results that you agreed upon.\n\nNow that you have a plan defined, documented and agreed upon, it's important to understand a key tenet: Innovating in any partner marketing means partnering to innovate in marketing.\n\nTangible strategic alliance impact comes through: 1) the power of your combined strengths and 2) the additive power of your individual strengths.\n\nThink of a pianist playing a piece on the piano. With one hand, they play a moving melody on the high notes and with the other, they play an inspiring rhythm on the low notes. Separately, what each hand is playing could stand on its own - but when played together the song is elevated to a masterpiece.\n\nWhen executing your joint strategic alliance marketing plan, plan for co-marketing, but make room for each alliance partner to bring their strengths to the plan, as an active participant. Each alliance partner has a portion of the plan - leveraging their marketing superpowers, communicating to their market and speaking in their voice.\n\nThus, together you are reinforcing your value to both markets, while reaching new markets.\n\nThis is one of the most taxing, yet critical parts of enacting a strategic alliance marketing plan. It entails ongoing observation, data tracking, fine tuning and pivoting as needed. This means day-to-day practitioners are regularly communicating outcomes to the working teams. It means leaders are conferring on what results mean and quickly taking steps to drive results.\n\nFortunately, technology is our friend here. Web data, digital marketing information and win/loss stats can fuel your marketing plan evolution. Embracing data that tells you your hypothesis was off the mark is a tremendous outcome - you've heard from your market, so you adjust. Make data driven decisions and then take fast action.\n\nHere's what's next: start now. Look at what's in front of you and develop a structured plan, leverage strengths from both partners and plan to \"execute, measure and adjust.\" You may be surprised at the results.",

                    "body": "Baxter: \"I can't wait to watch the team bring 24HR Marketing Plan to life\"\n\n24HR Business Plan, a business growth consultancy, has launched a new product offering - the 24HR Marketing Plan - to further drive client growth opportunities.\n\nJarther Taylor will lead 24HR Marketing Plan (24HRMP), joined by renowned global marketing leaders David Rebetzke and Bronwyn Powell as the senior advisory team.\n\nAimed primarily at small to medium size business enterprises or larger companies with small marketing teams, 24HRMP builds on the successful principles of the 24HR Business Plan and will help organisations bridge the gap between business and marketing strategies.\n\nAndrew Baxter, founder and senior advisor, 24HR Business Plan said the new offering enables companies to access highly experienced CMO's to lead their marketing planning process.\n\nIt will equip companies with the ability to find market opportunities for their businesses and create a marketing strategy and actionable plan for growth and sales success.\n\nBaxter said: \"A massive 83 per cent of CEOs say marketing can be a major driver of growth yet it is estimated that 90 per cent of marketers never develop an integrated marketing strategy aligned to their business plan. 24HRMP is a working model based on the successes of 24HR Business Plan and works in partnership with clients to deliver brand and marketing-led growth strategies and most importantly a clear route to implement the plan.\"\n\n24HRMP's team of senior advisors, comprising Taylor, Rebetzke and Powell, bring a combined 60+ years of experience leading long-term marketing growth strategies across a wealth of iconic local and global brands, to the program.\n\nThe program offers clients unprecedented access to the senior advisory team and covers every aspect of a brand and its products in market; from understanding the market context, to co-creating a clear strategy and ultimately developing an actionable marketing plan needed to drive sustainable market growth.\n\nTaylor said: \"I am excited to bring the proposition to market and have the opportunity to create something terrific and grow with it. And the best part of this opportunity is we bring the incredible skills and capabilities of our Senior Advisory team and make them accessible to our clients.\n\n\"The scale and breadth of our senior advisors' experience is unrivalled. Collectively we have distilled the best lessons learned from decades of marketing & business leadership into 24HRMP, so we can offer clients marketing skills and capabilities that are genuinely unique and brilliantly powerful.\n\n\"The program is targeted to businesses looking to lift their marketing capability by having access to experts with high level CMO credentials and a raft of international and local marketing experience.\n\nBronwyn Powell and Jarther Taylor\n\nOver a total of 24 hours the program combines several collaborative workshops and strategic development focussed on marketing's core 4P's to deliver a winning marketing strategy and executional plan.\n\nLinda Apostolidis, managing director, NewyTechPeople, said: \"We have grown incredibly quickly over 2 years and our brand has grown organically. Everything was in our head and we executed on the fly.\n\n\"Having external advice to help build an overarching marketing strategy and roadmap, that we can execute on, works well for the size of our business. It forced us to stop and consider where we were going, and we changed direction on a couple of our previous brand decisions. We have a much clearer road ahead.\n\n\"The team are so knowledgeable and experts getting to the core of your brand essence and messaging. We are super excited to execute on our marketing strategy and be ready for the next phase of our growth,\" she concluded.\n\nTaylor continued: \"Our mission is simple: help clients deliver actionable marketing plans based on a deep understanding of how marketing can lead their business' growth agenda.\n\n\"We help teams understand where their business is currently positioned and with the right marketing tools in-hand, where it can go. We then work with the client to understand strategies for product, price, place and promotion specific to their brand and then empower them to create a real and actionable marketing plan for growth.\n\n\"We are excited to bring our proposition to market. We believe this is a really fresh approach - a bespoke marketing program - backed by some of the best marketing minds in Australia and accessible to all levels of business,\" concluded Taylor.\n\nBaxter concluded: \"Collectively, the team's deep local and global knowledge and hands-on marketing experience, has created a dream team to take this product to market. I can't wait to watch the team bring 24HR Marketing Plan to life, and influence the way clients create marketing plans to drive business growth.\"\n\n-\n\nTop image: Andrew Baxter and David Rebetzke\n\nRelated Items:",

However, in 2012, the team had no established brand story or marketing team. Enter Dustin Godsey, the first marketing hire at the organization.\n\nIn this episode of the Speed of Culture podcast, Suzy founder and CEO Matt Britton sits down with Godsey, chief marketing officer at the Milwaukee Bucks to discuss how the Milwaukee Bucks built a championship culture and mentality that led the team to the 2021 NBA triumph and helped develop a successful, global brand.\n\nWhen you think about what we are as a brand, we're a championship culture.\n\nOriginally, Godsey wanted to be an NBA player but decided to study journalism at the University of Iowa. His marketing experience began in minor-league baseball with the Cedar Rapids Kernels and the Iowa Cubs. In 2008, Godsey took on the role of regional marketing director at Global Spectrum (now Spectra), shifting to Comcast Spectacor as the director of marketing.\n\nGodsey was hired in 2012 as the director of marketing services at the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming the team's first marketing employee. He was promoted to vice president of marketing, then chief marketing officer. As a result, Godsey has become a successful manager and leader of an ever-growing and changing team of marketing and PR professionals. He was also named Business Insider's 2022 Innovative CMO of the Year.\n\nLearn more about the Milwaukee Bucks' brand story and journey to becoming NBA champions by checking out the key takeaways of this episode below.",

Save 50% with early-bird passes.\n\nAfter winning the 2021 NBA championship, the Milwaukee Bucks became a basketball sensation with its leading star, Giannis Antetokounmpo. However, in 2012, the team had no established brand story or marketing team. Enter Dustin Godsey, the first marketing hire at the organization.\n\nIn this episode of the Speed of Culture podcast, Suzy founder and CEO Matt Britton sits down with Godsey, chief marketing officer at the Milwaukee Bucks to discuss how the Milwaukee Bucks built a championship culture and mentality that led the team to the 2021 NBA triumph and helped develop a successful, global brand.\n\nWhen you think about what we are as a brand, we're a championship culture.\n\nOriginally, Godsey wanted to be an NBA player but decided to study journalism at the University of Iowa. His marketing experience began in minor-league baseball with the Cedar Rapids Kernels and the Iowa Cubs. In 2008, Godsey took on the role of regional marketing director at Global Spectrum (now Spectra), shifting to Comcast Spectacor as the director of marketing.\n\nGodsey was hired in 2012 as the director of marketing services at the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming the team's first marketing employee. He was promoted to vice president of marketing, then chief marketing officer. As a result, Godsey has become a successful manager and leader of an ever-growing and changing team of marketing and PR professionals. He was also named Business Insider's 2022 Innovative CMO of the Year.\n\nLearn more about the Milwaukee Bucks' brand story and journey to becoming NBA champions by checking out the key takeaways of this episode below.",

Each one provides us with unique insights into how we can better connect with our current and future patients. We're proud of the ongoing launch of our new Intermountain Health brand. It's not just a marketing project, but an organizationwide effort to better respond to the needs of those we serve and position ourselves for the future of healthcare delivery.\n\nQ: What are the top trends in hospital/health system marketing nowadays?\n\nTS: If the last 12 months taught us anything, it's that the days of general, mass marketing are coming to a close, and developing an informed and trusted relationship with our current and future patients is imperative.\n\nQ: What have you found to be the most effective digital methods/strategies for marketing Intermountain?\n\nTS: We have been fortunate to utilize and optimize several digital strategies to help connect patients with the care they need.

It is our responsibility to make the best investments in marketing that allow our organization to grow.\n\nQ: How does the size and structure of Intermountain affect your marketing strategy?\n\nTS: Intermountain Health is fortunate to have a large and integrated team serving several diverse markets. As an integrated team, we are allowed to trial and test different approaches, then standardize best practices across our system. Our size allows us to be innovative and integration allows us to be responsive.\n\nQ: Where do you see hospital/health system marketing going next?\n\nTS: Marketing will continue to prioritize the digital experience as a focal connection point with patients and consumers.",

                    "body": "Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nAntonella Pisani is the CEO of Eyeful Media, a leading digital marketing agency that is one of the fastest-growing businesses in the US.\n\nThe decision for CMOs and business leaders to identify the best digital marketing agency for their company's needs can feel overwhelming. But it doesn't have to be. In many cases, a good area for your business to start is to do due diligence on whether your needs and expectations would be a better fit for a boutique marketing agency or a \"big shop.\" In this article, I'll focus on some considerations for working with a boutique agency specifically, based on my experience of running one.\n\nBoutique marketing agencies are smaller than the well-known \"big shops.\" This organizational structure typically helps the account team be more flexible, agile and customized to your needs.\n\nBoutique agencies also tend to be more specialized, often serving a specific vertical, company size and scope of work -- from digital marketing and creative to web development and public relations.\n\nKeep reading below for more details on how boutique marketing agencies could help support your business goals -- and what to consider when selecting a boutique agency partner.\n\nA more customized approach leads to better alignment with digital marketing strategies and client goals. Make sure you're not being led by templated digital marketing strategies designed to scale internal efficiencies that are often found at large corporate agencies.\n\nBoutique agencies are generally structured to deliver personalized attention to each client. Smaller agencies also have fewer client accounts to manage. In my experience, account leads and subject matter experts at boutique agencies typically work with two to five clients each. This leads to a more personalized approach to driving success.\n\nLarge marketing agencies typically rely on routine processes and systems that have proven to work over time. They develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) and playbooks so junior employees (typically those handling client accounts) have prescriptive marketing procedures to follow. Boutique marketing agencies generally don't have the same rigid protocols for marketing campaigns.\n\nNo matter what type of agency you choose, just make sure there's room for creative problem-solving and out-of-the-box solutions that can be explicitly tailored to your individual needs and goals.\n\nThis type of working environment often leads to more innovation and growth. Collaborating with a boutique agency that prioritizes these things can give your team more opportunities to engage, ask questions and provide context that will lead to innovative ideas and strategies for growth.\n\nA strong agency culture often leads to better teamwork and engagement on projects. While I can't speak for the big shops, I know for a fact that most (if not all) boutique agencies rely on culture to find their people. Employees at boutique firms are attracted to the nature of the work, their colleagues and company values, which typically translates to happy and passionate marketers dedicated to serving their clients.\n\nThe culture at boutique marketing agencies tends to attract unique and passionate talent -- people who are comfortable taking risks and doing things differently. This approach to agency structure creates a company culture that is charitable, service-minded and built on dedication.\n\nWhen looking for a marketing agency to work with, do not overlook the benefits of integrating a culture of teamwork that challenges the marketing status quo. These digital marketing leaders should also help create synergies and integration with your team to maximize productivity and create efficiencies.\n\nThe best agencies are led by senior-level marketing with years of valuable experience and insights. These digital marketing leaders can provide the fresh, creative new talent your company needs. They also can combine marketing strategy with clear and actionable next steps for implementation.\n\nA working relationship with a boutique agency should provide more access for your marketing team to experienced, senior-level talent. It is common, for example, to have a direct line of communication with your agency's CEO or vice presidents in an engagement with a boutique marketing company. Top-level leadership has more bandwidth to oversee day-to-day operations. As a result, this marketing partnership can also help with creative brainstorming and guides marketers to continually test, evolve and grow. Subject matter experts for boutique agencies can also help coach your team on best practices for sustaining growth.\n\nSelecting an agency is an important decision, so I hope this article helps you choose the one that is the best fit for your company. Remember that at the end of the day, it comes down to the specific team assigned to your account, whether the agency is large or small.\n\nForbes Agency Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies.

                    "body": "When the global pandemic hit many companies decided to reduce marketing budgets. Most times when a company faces uncertainties or financial constraints, the first on the firing line of budget cuts is the marketing department.\n\nOne would assume the opposite is true. Unfortunately, it is not always the case. After full two years of battling the hard lockdown of Covid-19 pandemic, the world started opening up. But, the damage or the impact of the pandemic remains.\n\nThe beginning of the third quarter of 2022 saw the global economies slipping into a recession and further putting pressure on companies to hold back on marketing spending.\n\nEven though, there are still clear signs that the road to recovery is still long. Some global markets are now showing good signs of returning to pre covid. In most developing and emerging markets, it seems as though there are still many more mountains to climb before actually witnessing any bounce back. These are high costs of food, fuel, load-shedding etc.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, companies and brands continue to be penny-pinching with budget allocations. Even though some of the budgets have been redirected from mass communication, marketing and advertising to a digital marketing approach only. As digital marketing has proved to be cost-efficient and, effective in delivering and reaching consumers. Thus, digital marketing has become the best bet for marketers and advertisers during this time of financial constraints. However, as the old adage says, \"with power comes great responsibility\", It is now time to demonstrate the value of digital marketing through Return-on Advertising Spend (ROAS).\n\nThis year marketers and brand managers will have to show the value and ROAS for their digital marketing spend. In the past, some advertisers and marketers have gotten away with lackluster demonstrations of these elements to postulate measuring and evaluating digital marketing campaigns and KPIs. And this has created an impression that spending money on digital marketing is wasteful compared to other mediums. Understanding digital marketing campaign KPIs and measurement would be critical at this stage. Providing brand reports littered with sentiment without data matching each rand spent will not cut anymore.\n\nOver the years, digital marketing has entrenched itself in the mainstream as an integral part of the integrated marketing and communication strategy approach.\n\nThus, it's important to take companies and brands into confidence. By demonstrating the true value of digital marketing during these difficult economic times, where budgets for marketing and advertising seem to be going down year-on-year.",
