USA TODAY Sports\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. - In so many ways, this has been the greatest year of Demaryius Thomas' life.\n\nHe received a $70 million contract from the Denver Broncos, a well-earned pay raise after three Pro Bowl seasons in his first five years in the NFL, and the life-changing news that came in July, when his mother, Katina Smith, was released after more than 15 years in prison.\n\nBut such great joys weren't without their pitfalls.\n\nThe huge contract came with massive expectations, even as the Broncos transformed from a pass-heavy offense to a run-first scheme that would take a toll on his stats. And his mother's return home for the first time since Thomas was 11 meant major responsibilities for her now-grown son, even if he could not travel to Georgia to see her.\n\nSmith went from a Tallahassee, Fla., prison to a Georgia halfway house in July. Then in November, she was released to live fully on her own for the first time since 1999. She needed Thomas' help with getting settled and adjusted, and he grew accustomed to talking to her multiple times a day.\n\nBut the hardest part for Thomas was knowing that even though Smith was no longer incarcerated, he was still so far away from her, because of his rigorous NFL schedule and rules that barred her from traveling until after the New Year.\n\n\"That was the biggest thing, just not seeing her,\" Thomas said Tuesday. \"That bothered me a little bit.\"\n\nThey finally reunited for the Broncos' divisional playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers last month. Smith flew to Denver and watched her son play in person for the first time. She wore a personalized No. 88 jersey and sat in a suite. She watched the AFC Championship Game from home in Georgia, but she'll be in Santa Clara on Sunday for the Super Bowl, Thomas said.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAll signs point to Brock Osweiler as Broncos' starting quarterback for 2016\n\nHe insists it's not a distraction, nor is it any extra motivation. It's just exciting, he said, to know that she'll be there, and that she'll be so happy.\n\nAnd he's happy now, too, and seemingly relieved that the pressure of his mother's first trip is over. Perhaps that will be a good sign as he heads into Super Bowl 50 against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nThe off-field stress he was dealing with in November and December coincided with a rough stretch of games, with just one game with double-digit catches and one with more than 100 yards over the Broncos' final 10 regular-season contests. He struggled with drops - he had at least nine this season - and finished the year with 1,304 receiving yards and six touchdowns, both significant decreases from his 2014 output.\n\nHe had just two catches for 12 yards in the AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBrennan: What will be Peyton Manning's legacy after Super Bowl 50?\n\n\"He does get a lot of criticism about the drops, but it's not fair. Everybody forgets he had 1,300 yards this year. It's like come on, man. He got 1,300; leave the man alone,\" wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders said. \"OK, he might have eight drops, but ask any organization in the National Football League if they'll take Demaryius Thomas and they'll say yes, bring him over here. I'm just happy to be a part of it, happy to be his teammate.\"\n\nBut Thomas played well in the Broncos' previous Super Bowl appearance. He may have been the only Broncos offensive player to have a good game against the Seattle Seahawks two years ago, with a Super Bowl record 13 catches for 118 yards and a touchdown in the 43-8 loss.\n\nMatching those numbers against the Panthers could prove difficult if Thomas draws the matchup against Carolina's No. 1 cornerback Josh Norman. But Thomas might have advantages that other receivers who have struggled against Norman this year do not. He's quiet on the field, with a low-key demeanor that should prevent Norman from getting into his head like happened with the Giants' Odell Beckham Jr., and he's got a standout receiver opposite him in Sanders.\n\nSeveral times this year, including in the AFC Championship Game, Sanders has been the one who has drawn the top opposing cornerback.\n\n\"I think that a lot of teams put their No. 1 corner on me and then put the No. 2 on Demaryius and give that No. 1 help over the top. Which is smart, but sometimes I end up beating that No. 1 corner,\" Sanders said, laughing. \"Norman is a great corner, but Demaryius and I have been facing great corners all year.\"\n\n***\n\nFollow Lindsay H.

                    "body": "Online sportsbook Bovada.lv has once again compiled a list of amausing Super Bowl specials. Here are the most notable ones along with our expert analysis. If you're in a place where betting on the Super Bowl is illegal, this is all purely theoretical, of course ...\n\n1. Will Peyton Manning announce his retirement in the postgame interview?\n\nYes +500 (5/1)\n\nNo -1000 (1/10)\n\nVerdict: YES. He probably won't, but it would be such a glorious way to go out.\n\n2. Will Peyton Manning be seen crying at any point during the entire Broadcast?\n\nYes +600 (6/1)\n\nNo -1200 (1/12)\n\nVerdict: YES. Let the tears flow, Peyton.\n\n3. How many times will \"dab\" or \"dabbing\" be said by the announcers during the Broadcast?\n\nOver 2 (EVEN, 1/1)\n\nUnder 2 (-140, 5/7)\n\nVerdict: UNDER. Over two dabs just seems a bit repetitive, doesn't it?\n\n4. How many times will Cam Newton do the Open Shirt Superman motion during the game?\n\nOver 2.5 (EVEN, 1/1)\n\nUnder 2.5 (-140, 5/7)\n\nVerdict: OVER. It's predicated on the Panthers winning, but come on: it's his signature.\n\n5. If Steph Curry is shown on TV during the Broadcast what will he be wearing?\n\nPersonalized Carolina Steph Curry Jersey 1/1\n\nNo Jersey 2/1\n\nCam Newton Jersey 3/1\n\nAny Other Carolina Jersey 5/1\n\nVerdict: PERSONALIZED JERSEY. Too easy.\n\n6. Will Mike Carey be wrong about a challenge?\n\nYes +110 (11/10)\n\nNo -150 (2/3)\n\nVerdict: NO. Mike Carey isn't actually that bad.\n\n7. Will there be an earthquake during the game?\n\nYes 10/1\n\nVerdict: NO. Don't give yourself a reason to root for earthquakes.\n\n8. Will the Panthers player who scores their first TD give the football to a Boy or Girl?\n\nBoy -200 (1/2)\n\nGirl +150 (3/2)\n\nVerdict: BOY. The safe bet because there'll probably be more of them there.\n\n9. How many times will the Golden Gate Bridge be shown during the Broadcast?\n\nOver 0.5 -300 (1/3)\n\nUnder 0.5 +200 (2/1)\n\nVerdict: OVER. Free (theoretical) money.\n\n10. How many times will \"John Fox\" be said during the Broadcast?\n\nOver 1 (-140, 5/7)\n\nUnder 1 (EVEN, 1/1)\n\nVerdict: OVER. Potential payoff of the under doesn't make that bet worth it.\n\n11. How many times will Archie Manning be shown on TV during the Broadcast?\n\nOver 1.5 EVEN (1/1)\n\nUnder 1.5 -140 (5/7)\n\nVerdict: OVER. Once is a lock, it's the extra .5 that makes it a swing vote.\n\n(Derick E. Hingle / USA TODAY Sports)\n\n12. How many times will John Elway be shown on TV during broadcast?\n\nOver 2.5 EVEN (1/1)\n\nUnder 2.5 -140 (5/7)\n\nVerdict: UNDER. Three is a lot, especially if the Broncos get behind early and go on to lose.\n\n13. Will the announcers mention that Kubiak was Elway's backup during the broadcast?\n\nYes +120 (6/5)\n\nNo -160 (5/8)\n\nVerdict: YES. That little snippet of information is too tempting.\n\n14. What color will the liquid be that is poured on the winning coach?\n\nOrange 5/4\n\nBlue 3/1\n\nClear 4/1\n\nYellow 4/1\n\nRed 6/1\n\nGreen 10/1\n\nPurple 10/1\n\nVerdict: BLUE. Decent value here. Blue Gatorade was dumped on Belichick last year, and both teams play in blue.\n\n15. Who will the Super Bowl MVP mention first?\n\nGod 2/1\n\nTeam 2/1\n\nCity/Fans 6/1\n\nCoach 15/2\n\nFamily 15/1\n\nDoes not Mention Anyone above 9/4\n\nVerdict: FAMILY. Say Cam wins, his son was just born -- 15/1 is a big price in those circumstances.\n\n16. Which song will Coldplay play first during the Halftime show?\n\nAdventure of a Lifetime 2/1\n\nFix You 7/2\n\nA Sky Full of Stars 9/2\n\nViva la Vida 5/1\n\nClocks 15/2\n\nSpeed of Sound 9/1\n\nHead Full of Dreams 10/1\n\nParadise 10/1\n\nVerdict: FIX YOU. \"I'm banging Fix You hard; that's free money at 7/2,\" - FTW Culture Editor Nate Scott.\n\n17. What color will Beyonce's footwear be when she comes on stage for the Halftime show?\n\nBlack 3/2\n\nGold/Brown 5/2\n\nWhite 11/4\n\nSilver/Grey 19/4\n\nAny Other Color 7/1\n\nVerdict: GOLD/BROWN. That was the predominant color in the music video for Beyonce's recent collaboration with Coldplay.\n\n18. Will \"Left Shark\" Make an appearance on stage during the Super Bowl Halftime Show?\n\nYes 15/1\n\nVerdict: NO. Doing that would require the NFL to have a decent sense of humor.\n\n19. How many million viewers will Super Bowl 50 have?\n\nOver/Under 117 million\n\nVerdict: OVER. Was north of a 120 million last year, and now we have Cam vs. Peyton.\n\n20. What will the Nielsen Rating be for Super Bowl 50?\n\nOver/Under 48.5\n\nVerdict: OVER. Did 49.7 last year; let's throw caution to the wind and be bullish.\n\n21. Which Region will have a higher Nielsen Rating?\n\nDenver -140 (5/7)\n\nCharlotte EVEN (1/1)\n\nVerdict: DENVER. This could be Peyton's last chance!?\n\n22. How many wings will Buffalo Wild Wings Sell on Super Bowl Day?\n\nOver/Under 12 million\n\nVerdict: UNDER. Didn't hit that number last year, and it's an awful lot of chicken.\n\n23. Coin Toss\n\nHeads -105 (20/21)\n\nTails -105 (20/21)\n\nVerdict: TAILS. Tails never fails, obviously.\n\n24. Will the referee redo the Coin Toss?\n\nYes 20/1\n\nVerdict: NO. Don't be cheeky.\n\n25. Will the team that chooses Heads or Tails in the coin toss be correct?\n\nYes -105 (20/21)\n\nNo -105 (20/21)\n\nVerdict: YES. I mean, I don't know. It's literally betting on a coin flip.\n\n26. Team to win the coin toss\n\nCarolina Panthers -105 (20/21)\n\nDenver Broncos -105 (20/21)\n\nVerdict: PANTHERS. Again, it's a coin flip.\n\n27. Will the team that wins the coin toss win the game?\n\nYes -105 (20/21)\n\nNo -105 (20/21)\n\nVerdict: YES. Why not?\n\n28. Will there be a penalty for excessive celebration?\n\nYes +250 (5/2)\n\nNo -400 (1/4)\n\nVerdict: NO. It's the Super Bowl, they'll let it slide.\n\n29. Will either backup QB take a snap in the game?\n\nYes +200 (2/1)\n\nNo -300 (1/3)\n\nVerdict: NO. It all comes down to Peyton, and I think he'll make it through the game.\n\n30. Cross Sport Props - What will be higher?\n\nTrump % Points in the New Hampshire Primary -200 (1/2)\n\nTotal Points scored by the winning Super Bowl team +150 (3/2)\n\nVerdict: TRUMP. He's hovering in the high 30s right now. Even if turnout suffers and his oppoents eat into his lead, not sure either team could catch him.\n\n31. Cross Sport Props - Exact Outcome\n\nCarolina wins Super Bowl - Trump Wins 2016 Presidential Election 13/4\n\nCarolina wins Super Bowl - Cinton Wins 2016 Presidential Election 7/4\n\nCarolina wins Super Bowl - Sanders Wins 2016 Presidential Election 5/1\n\nDenver wins Super Bowl - Trump Wins 2016 Presidential Election 7/1\n\nDenver wins Super Bowl - Clinton Wins 2016 Presidential Election 9/2\n\nDenver wins Super Bowl - Sanders Wins 2016 Presidential Election 10/1\n\nVerdict: CAROLINA-CLINTON. Pundits think Trump and Sanders will struggle to overcome the Republican and Democratic establishments. That leaves Clinton, and if you haven't deduced it by now, I'm picking Carolina to beat Denver.\n\n32. Cross Sport Props - What are the odds the Carolina Panthers win the 2016 Super Bowl and the Golden State Warriors win the 2015-2016 NBA Title?\n\nYes 2/1\n\nVerdict: YES. It's going to be a good year for Steph Curry.\n\n33. Will Denver win Super Bowl, Peyton Manning Retires, San Antonio wins NBA Championship, Tim Duncan Retires?\n\nYes 20/1\n\nVerdict: NO. I'm only voting \"no\" for the sake of consistency; this would be a fun bet to pull for.\n\n34. Cross Sport Props - What will be higher?\n\nDeMarcus Cousins Points and Rebounds Feb. 7th\n\nCam Newton Rushing Yards\n\nVerdict: COUSINS. Cousins has averaged 27 points with 11 rebounds so far this season, and had 16 points with seven rebounds the last time he played the Celtics (his Feb 7th opponent). Let's say Cousins gets 32-ish combined points/rebounds this time; Cam has been held to under 32 yards seven times this season, and I like Denver's stout rush defence to do it again.\n\n35. Cross Sport Props - What will be higher?\n\nTotal Goals in the Montreal vs Carolina NHL game on Feb. 7th\n\nTotal Receptions by Greg Olsen\n\nVerdict: OLSEN. Olsen is averaging more than seven receptions a game so far this season and seven on the number this postseason. That'd require a high-scoring game between Montreal and Carolina, who are each averaging about two goals per game so far this season.\n\n36. Cross Sport Props - What will be higher?\n\nTiger Woods 1st Round score at 2016 Masters\n\nEmmanuel Sanders Receiving Yards\n\nVerdict: SANDERS. This is a joke, right? Tiger almost definitely won't hit a shot at the 2016 Masters because he's injured, so even if Sanders has just one receiving yard, he'll still win.\n\n37. Cross Sport Props - What will be higher?\n\nArsenal Total Goals on Feb. 7th\n\nPeyton Manning TD Passes\n\nVerdict: ARSENAL. Arsenal will probably win 2-1, but against a smaller team like Bournemouth could score three or four. Can't really see Manning throwing more than two, at the most, touchdown passes.\n\nThat's where we stand. Good luck, and may fortune be ever in your favor.\n\nFeb 1, 2016; San Jose, CA, USA; Denver Broncos fan Rocky the Colorado Leprechaun reacts before Super Bowl 50 Opening Night media day at SAP Center.

                    "body": "5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- The ritual is always the same. Before C.J. Anderson pulls on his cleats Sunday and prepares to step into the fray of Super Bowl 50, he will spend a moment in silent contemplation of a fallen friend.\n\nFor the Denver Broncos running back, returning to the Bay Area means coming home. Anderson grew up in the troubled city of Vallejo, just outside Oakland, and attended Jesse Bethel High School.\n\nThat is where he stood watching on the sideline Nov.7, 2004, when his friend and hero Mike Pennerman prepared to hold for an extra point. It was the last play Pennerman, a freakishly talented junior receiver seemingly destined for a big college career and possibly more, would ever make.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSuper Bowl 50 matchups: Broncos RB C.J. Anderson vs. Panthers' front seven\n\n\"I remember how great he was. It was unbelievable the skill he had for a high school player,\" Anderson said. \"I know he would have made it. He would have been great in college and made it to the NFL, I'm sure of it. Everyone in the area tries to live in his honor. He is never forgotten.\"\n\nThe snap on that PAT went over Pennerman's head, and he scrambled to collect it, before being piled on by a pack of players from Rodriguez High School. After walking to the sideline, Pennerman, a cousin of 1994 Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam, complained of feeling \"heavy,\" collapsed and died in hospital the following day as a result of brain injuries.\n\nHis death stunned the local community and had a profound impact on Anderson, who was then a freshman and preparing for his own standout high school career.\n\n\"I think it shows even now in C.J.,\" his former high school teammate, Patrick Little, said in a telephone conversation with USA TODAY Sports.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n49 memorable moments, fun facts from every Super Bowl\n\nLittle is now offensive coordinator at Bethel.\n\n\"It made him realize that you must take every moment as if it is your last,\" added Little. \"That's why his intensity and drive are so strong. He has seen someone have everything one day and then suddenly they are gone.\"\n\nAnderson rushed for 720 yards and five TDs in 15 games during the regular season, and his ability to generate yardage on the ground will likely be critical for the Broncos against the Carolina Panthers' stingy defense. The 24-year-old, who played his college ball at Cal, said that playing a Super Bowl so close to home is the \"icing on the cake.\"\n\nVallejo is a blue-collar city that has endured serious difficulty. Property prices are roughly a quarter of those in San Francisco, just 28 miles away. The mid-1990s closure of a major shipyard resulted in thousands of job losses, and Vallejo declared bankruptcy in 2008.\n\nWith an overstretched school system, high crime rate and severe cuts in policing services, Vallejo's reputation has dipped compared to more affluent Bay Area neighborhoods. For Anderson, however, it is home -- and very much where the heart is.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n'Bittersweet' Super Bowl experience continues for Broncos LT Ryan Clady\n\n\"Before and after games, I think about where I came from and the people there,\" he said. \"It is the easiest thing in the world to forget where you came from, but that is not an option for me. It made me who I am.\n\n\"It is an area that has had some difficult times, but it brings everyone close together. I know that they're behind me in whatever I do. ... I represent them every time I'm on the field.\"\n\nAnderson's career was a struggle in itself. He spent two years at junior college to boost his academics before joining the Bears, where he wore jersey No. 9 in Pennerman's honor.\n\nDespite going undrafted, he has become one of the cornerstones of the Broncos offense, with the run game more vital than ever due to Peyton Manning's waning powers.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWade Phillips: 'Quit Twittering me' for spot on Broncos\n\nJeff Turner, who has coached at Bethel for 17 years, says Anderson's links to his old school are far more than just lip service.\n\n\"C.J. comes back in the summertime to talk to the kids or to work out,\" Turner said. \"You can tell he still feels this strong connection and feels that it is a part of him and his journey.\n\n\"He is a great figure of inspiration for us to use when we talk to the kids. He is a guy who didn't have it the easiest, but he fought through.\n\n\"And look at him now.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Broncos' road to Super Bowl 50\n\nRoad to Super Bowl 50: One great photo from each Broncos game Fullscreen The AFC champion Denver Broncos, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning, are headed to Super Bowl 50 after a 12-4 regular season and pair of narrow wins in the playoffs.

USA TODAY Sports\n\n91 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Bittersweet describes Ryan Clady's Super Bowl experience.\n\nFor the second time in three years, his Denver Broncos are in the Super Bowl. And for the second time, the perennial Pro Bowl left tackle is missing the game with a season-ending injury.\n\nClady, the Broncos' longest tenured player, suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament during a practice in May. In 2013, he spent most of the season on injured reserve after suffering a Lisfranc fracture.\n\n\"It's definitely bittersweet. I've played in this league eight years now, and the two times we go to the Super Bowl, I'm not out there,\" Clady told USA TODAY Sports. \"I'm happy for my teammates, and I'm happy to be here this week. And I'm happy New England's not here, to be honest with you.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPeyton Manning found comeback aide in Jordan Taylor\n\nClady's injury forced major changes to the offensive line and also put his future with the team in doubt. He is set to make $9.5 million in 2016 and $10 million in 2017 -- figures that might be too high for a guy with his recent injury history and a team that has many pressing contract issues to deal with.\n\n\"I would restructure,\" Clady said. \"I would like to (stay). I've had a lot of teammates that left, so I've heard about what it's like around the league. I would like to stay here. I'm comfortable here. I like the city, and the fans are awesome.\"\n\nThe Broncos drafted a left tackle, Ty Sambrailo, in the second round last spring. But he, too, spent most of the year on injured reserve after suffering a shoulder injury in September.\n\nThe Broncos wound up playing most of the season with journeyman Ryan Harris at left tackle and second-year player Michael Schofield on the right side. Over the course of 18 games, Denver played four different line combinations with center Matt Paradis the only lineman to start every game.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBroncos GM John Elway's Super Bowl advice to Peyton Manning: 'Stay in the moment'\n\nAnd the turmoil often showed.\n\nPeyton Manning was sacked 16 times in his first nine starts. Backup Brock Osweiler took 23 sacks in his seven starts, including five by Khalil Mack in the second half of a loss to the Oakland Raiders in December. Though Osweiler is more mobile and better able to escape the pocket than Manning, his tendency to hold the ball longer led to several sacks.\n\nIt's hard not to wonder then what the Broncos might have looked like with Clady and Sambrailo in the lineup. Yet it's difficult to picture because they barely even practiced together. But both stayed involved by going through their rehab processes in Denver, and they were both frequent visitors in the offensive line meetings. They've been at most home games and are here for Super Bowl week.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSuper Bowl 50 preview: How Panthers, Broncos stack up\n\nClady was among the injured players left behind during the week leading up to the Super Bowl in New Jersey two years ago.\n\n\"That's one of my best friends. To have him out here, to have this experience, to share it with one of my best friends has been awesome,\" Harris told USA TODAY Sports. \"No one who knows him wanted him to go through what he's been through. But also, injuries are a part of the game.\n\n\"He's doing a great job. He's got his knee rehabbed, and he'll be continuing to play in the NFL.\"\n\n***\n\nFollow Lindsay H.

                    "body": "A 43-8 blowout loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII where the Denver Broncos were physically manhandled prompted general manager and executive vice-president of football operations John Elway to reconfigure his roster despite having one of the most prolific offenses in NFL history. The 2013 Broncos scored an NFL record 606 points while carrying a defense that ranked 19th in total defense and 22nd in scoring defense.\n\nElway left the lopsided defeat convinced that the Broncos needed to more resemble the teams of the final two years of his career which won back-to-back Super Bowls. In 1997 and 1998, he no longer had to carry the franchise because those victorious Super Bowl teams relied on a strong running game and a good defense.\n\nThe salary cap being designed to prevent teams from keeping all of their talented players has aided Elway in the transformation. Only six players (three from each side of the ball) who started in Super Bowl XLVIII remain on the Broncos. It would be more but a couple of defensive starters, including All-Pro outside linebacker Von Miller, were lost to season-ending injuries in 2013. There are just 21 players still on the Broncos that were a part of the Super Bowl XLVIII squad.\n\nThe Broncos have been aggressive in free agency by acquiring key defensive pieces to offset the loss of valuable offensive players in the open market. Most notably, Elway signed three defensive players, cornerback Aqib Talib, safety T.J. Ward and defensive end/outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, to contracts worth $109.5 million during the first 24 hours of free agency in 2014. Defense has also been emphasized early in the NFL draft. Denver's first selection in each of last five drafts has been a defensive player.\n\nElway replaced John Fox as head coach despite a 49-22 overall record with his former backup Gary Kubiak to help implement his vision. Kubiak's most important coaching hire has been former Broncos head coach Wade Phillips, who was out of coaching last season, as defensive coordinator. Phillips employing his trademark 3-4 scheme has turned the Broncos into the NFL's best defense. The Broncos are tops in several categories, including total defense (283.1 yards per game) and sacks (52).\n\nHere's a position-by-position look at how the Broncos went from an offensive juggernaut to a defensive powerhouse in two short years.\n\nRoster\n\nQuarterback: Peyton Manning's battle with Father Time is now going about as badly as Super Bowl XLVIII did for the Broncos. It was hard to imagine that Manning wouldn't finish the five-year, $96 million contract he signed in 2012 after throwing for the most passing yards (5,477) and touchdowns (55) ever in a season in 2013.\n\nManning is in the midst of his worst and arguably most challenging professional season after taking a $4 million pay cut in the offseason to lower his salary to $15 million. He made $2 million of the $4 million back by Denver getting to the Super Bowl. Manning will earn the other $2 million with a Super Bowl win where he plays at least 70 percent of Denver's offensive snaps.\n\nThe five-time NFL MVP was sidelined for six games because of a plantar fascia tear near his left heel and only reclaimed his starting job from Brock Osweiler, an impending unrestricted free agent, after a relief appearance in the regular season finale against the San Diego Chargers. Manning threw more interceptions (17) than touchdown passes (nine) for the first time since his rookie year in 1998. The 39-year-old had a career low 67.9 passing rating. Manning's 59.8 completion percentage was his first under 65 percent since 2001 and the second-lowest of his career.\n\nA Super Bowl 50 victory will give Manning a chance for the same storybook ending to his career that Elway had when he made Super Bowl XXXIII his final game at 38 years old. The consensus opinion is Manning should and will hang up his cleats regardless of the Super Bowl's outcome.\n\nRunning Back: The running game hasn't been as productive as Elway envisioned. Denver is still a middle-of-the-road rushing team, like in 2013, ranking 17th with 107.4 yards per game but without a lethal passing attack. Leading rusher Ronnie Hillman was in the doghouse and inactive for the Super Bowl two years ago. Second leading rusher C.J. Anderson was a bit player as well during his rookie campaign.\n\nKnowshon Moreno surprisingly became Denver's feature back because of Hillman's inability to hold onto the football and 2014 second-round pick Montee Ball's trouble with pass protection. Ball was waived this preseason. Moreno topped the 1,000-yard rushing mark for the first time in his career, was fifth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage (1,586 yards) and had 13 touchdowns in 2013. After the expiration of his rookie contract following Super Bowl XLVIII, Moreno signed a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins worth $3 million. Moreno hasn't played in the NFL since tearing the ACL in his right knee during his third game with the Dolphins.\n\nWide Receiver: Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker were both on rookie contracts for Super Bowl XLVIII. Decker was in the final year of a four-year rookie contract paying him $1.323 million in 2013. Thomas had yet to enter the last year of the five-year, $12,155,500 deal he received as the 22nd overall pick in the 2010 draft.\n\nThe Broncos were comfortable letting Decker leave because he was considered as the beneficiary of playing with Manning and a talented receiving corps. Decker signed a five-year, $36.25 million (with $15 million guaranteed) contract with the New York Jets. Emmanuel Sanders is capably filling Decker's shoes on his three-year, $15 million deal (worth a maximum of $18 million through salary escalators). Thomas received a five-year, $70 million contract (with $43.5 million in guarantees) last July as Denver's franchise player.\n\nThe emphasis on the running game under Kubiak has meant that a high-priced slot wide receiver, like Wes Welker ($12 million for two years), wasn't necessary anymore. Jordan Norwood has taken over the role this season for $795,000, which is less than 15 percent of Welker's 2014 salary.\n\nTight End: The Broncos turned to Kubiak favorite Owen Daniels when the Jacksonville Jaguars made Julius Thomas the NFL's second highest-paid tight end with a five-year, $46 million deal containing $24 million in guarantees. Daniels played under Kubiak for eight years with the Houston Texans and joined the Baltimore Ravens in 2014 for the Denver head coach's lone season as offensive coordinator in 2014. Virgil Green, whose role has dramatically increased since Super Bowl XLVIII, and Daniels received three-year contracts for $8.4 million and $12.5 million respectively. Their combined deals don't quite equal the $21 million Thomas had fully guaranteed at signing. The Broncos gave 2016 and 2017 sixth-round picks to San Francisco 49ers for Vernon Davis, who has an expiring contract, and a 2016 seventh-round pick at the trading deadline because Daniels and Green were struggling to make up for the loss of Thomas. Davis hasn't made much of impact since the trade.\n\nOffensive Line: Right guard Louis Vasquez and five-time Pro Bowl left tackle Ryan Clady are the only lineman left from Denver's last Super Bowl trip. Clady is missing his second-straight Super Bowl after an offseason ACL tear. He missed a majority of the 2013 season with a Lisfranc foot injury.\n\nGuards Zane Beadles and Orlando Franklin left via free agency to sign with the Jaguars and Chargers in 2014 and 2015 respectively for five-year deals at $30 million and $36.5 million. Pro Bowl left guard Evan Mathis was a preseason pickup for a one-year deal worth $4 million after the Philadelphia Eagles released him in June because of a contract dispute. Center Manny Ramirez and tackle Chris Clark, the other two Super Bowl starters, were traded after last season.\n\nElway has primarily used the draft to rebuild the line. Tackle Michael Schofield and center Matt Paradis were 2014 draft picks. Tackle Ty Sambrailo was taken in 2015's second round. He was limited to three games because of a shoulder injury. His injury and Clady's have hindered the line's cohesion and effectiveness.\n\nDefensive Line: Defensive end Malik Jackson and nose tackle Sylvester Williams, a 2013 first-round pick, will be starting their second Super Bowl. Jackson's start came courtesy of Derek Wolfe being lost late in the season because of a seizure related to a preseason spinal cord injury. These three anchor Denver's defensive line. Williams has aptly replaced Terrance Knighton, who signed a one-year, $4 million deal, in controlling the line of scrimmage against the run. Depth is provided by veterans Antonio Smith and Vance Walker, who are on modest short-term deals averaging $2 million.\n\nLinebackers: The Super Bowl XLVIII linebackers aren't comparable to the current group. Danny Trevathan, a 2012 sixth-round pick, is the holdover starter from the game as Wesley Woodyard and Nate Irving have moved on in free agency.\n\nMiller was at a career crossroads two years ago because of the six-game suspension he served to start the 2013 season for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and the ACL tear he suffered later in the year. His troubles are behind him as he has been dismissed from the league's drug program after staying clean for two years and regained his pre-injury form. He has the same status as someone who has never failed a drug test.\n\nWare was originally signed to bolster the pass rush as a defense end replacing Shaun Phillips, who made $1.8 million in his only year with Denver, before the switch to a 3-4 this year. He received a three-year, $30 million deal where $16.5 million was fully guaranteed upon execution. It's interesting that Ware's contract is 66.7 percent more than the $18 million over three years the Broncos offered Elvis Dumervil after he was released because of a paperwork snafu on his renegotiated contract that was going to reduce his 2013 salary from $12 million to $8 million.\n\nBrandon Marshall, who landed on Denver's practice squad in 2013 after the Jacksonville Jaguars released him, unexpectedly turned in a Pro Bowl caliber 2014 season when being pressed into service because of an injury to Trevathan. Marshall has successfully shifted to inside linebacker under Phillips. He is an exclusive rights player making his $585,000 minimum salary this season. Shane Ray, the 23rd overall pick in 2015's draft and Shaquil Barrett, who spent the 2014 season on the practice squad, provide pass-rushing depth.\n\nSecondary: Wholesale changes have been made to secondary. At cornerback, Champ Bailey, who had an injury-plagued 2013 season, was only starting because Chris Harris suffered an ACL tear against the Chargers in the divisional playoff round. The Broncos picked up $10 million of much-needed 2014 salary cap space by parting ways with Bailey, who has since retired. Aqib Talib was given a six-year, $57 million contract containing $25.5 million in guarantees instead of re-signing Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, who took a five-year, $35 million contract (worth a maximum of $39 million through salary escalators) from the New York Giants after negotiations with the Broncos stalled.\n\nThe Broncos are getting a tremendous value from Chris Harris because he took a hometown discount with the five-year, $42.5 million contract extension (worth up to $49 million with salary escalators) he signed late in the 2014 season. Bradley Roby, who serves as the third cornerback, was a 2014 first-round pick.\n\nT.J. Ward brings a physicality at strong safety that was missing with Duke Ihenacho. He's been well worth the four-year, $22.5 million contract he received. Mike Adams, who has since moved on to the Indianapolis Colts in free agency, was filling in for Rahim Moore at free safety after he underwent emergency surgery on his left lower leg for compartment syndrome during the second half of the season. Darian Stewart, who was with Kubiak in Baltimore last season, received a two-year, $4.25 million contract (with a maximum value of $6 million through performance bonuses) has been an upgrade over Moore. Moore went to the Texans on a three-year, $12 million deal in free agency.\n\nSpecial Teams: The only significant change is Brandon McManus replacing Matt Prater at kicker. McManus was acquired from the Giants in a trade after Prater received a four suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse drug policy. Prater, who was one of the league's highest-paid kickers at $3.25 million per year, eventually lost his job because of the suspension. Connor Barth was brought in when McManus faltered last season but couldn't win a kicking competition between the two in the preseason. McManus is making $510,000 this season.",

He is involved in the process of setting and adjusting the spread. The line is not based on the idea that the Panthers will beat the Broncos by six points. Rather, it is set based on what will get the most even amount of money bet on the game. If 50 percent of the money is on the Panthers and 50 percent is on the Broncos, then the house is guaranteed to win because of their cut of all wagers.\n\nThis year, money is rolling in like crazy on the Panthers. Even though Denver has a strong defense, the betting public has bought into the Panthers in a big way. Here is what Kevin had to say about Super Bowl 50:",

                    "title": "Broncos, Panthers Nearly Even On Defense, But Denver Holds Slight Edge",
                    "body": "If you want to drive yourself crazy, you should pore over the Denver Broncos' and Carolina Panthers' defensive statistics and try to decide which team has the better unit going into Super Bowl 50.\n\nBut we did it for you instead.\n\nThe thing is, you have to almost look past the statistics when it comes to comparing the Broncos' D against the Panthers' because they're that close. You can have a look for yourself, if you don't believe us.\n\nBased on those very basic numbers, you might put your money on the Broncos for their pass defense. Denver finished the regular season with the best passing defense in the NFL and the third-best rushing defense compared to Carolina's 11th- and fourth-place units, respectively. But that would completely ignore what kind of a team the Panthers are.\n\nPanthers quarterback Cam Newton can run, and for that reason, he doesn't pass the ball as much as other teams do. Carolina had the sixth fewest passing attempts (501) in the league in 2015 but had the most rushing attempts (526). The Broncos' pass defense likely won't be tested as much because of the Panthers' run-heavy offense.\n\nBut despite that, the Broncos still look sharper in this matchup. Because their pass defense is so good, Pro Bowl cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Chris Harris Jr. should have no problem shutting down the likes of Carolina wideouts Ted Ginn, Jr., Devin Funchess and Philly Brown. Tight end Greg Olsen might cause some problems, but Denver has the manpower to handle them, even with free safety Darian Stewart playing on a sprained knee.\n\nSo, basically, Super Bowl 50 likely will come down to which team can stop the run better, and that's where it gets tough.\n\nBroncos running backs C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman are good, but they're not Newton or Carolina running back Jonathan Stewart. However, they get a boost in the fact that Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis will be playing with a broken arm, if he even plays at all. That injury likely could be what sets these two units apart.\n\nDenver also has the edge when it comes to turnovers. The Panthers have more interceptions, but the Broncos' make theirs count. Carolina scored four touchdowns with 301 yards on 24 interceptions, but the Broncos needed just 14 to gain 321 yards and four touchdowns of their own. When Denver's defense is able to take the ball away, it often becomes deadly. The Panthers also could have a hard time taking the ball from Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning while he has wide receivers Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders and tight end Owen Daniels going up against a Carolina secondary whose one real star is cornerback Josh Norman.\n\nNewton will have his work cut out for him when he has to face the Broncos come Sunday. Of course, there's always a possibility that playoff Peyton Manning will show up and make Carolina's defense look like the 1985 Chicago Bears. But either way, you can be assured that Manning's elite defense will be there to bail him out, win or lose.",

The Dez Bryant-Calvin Johnson rule receives the greatest scrutiny yet it is only a sliver of the NFL's ever-growing, somewhat subjectively applied rule book that is often met with disdain by those inside and outside the league.\n\nNo rules will be changed in the lead-up to Super Bowl 50, but we asked the biggest stars from the Panthers and Broncos to pick out the one rule they would most like to see altered in the future.\n\nPeyton Manning, Broncos QB: \"I don't understand if you're on the one-yard line about to score and we jump offsides, we go back five yards. On the very next play, I draw them off and we only go half the distance. Why don't we get to go back all five yards? That would be a good rule to change.\"\n\nChris Harris Jr., Broncos CB: \"Pass interference, every day. As a cornerback, of course you would take that out.\"\n\nT.J. Ward, Broncos S: \"I'd say the uniform rules because I like to be stylish and be an individual.\"\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nOwen Daniels, Broncos TE: \"The celebration rule.

You can celebrate by yourself, but not as a team.\"\n\nAqib Talib, Broncos CB: \"Pass interference.

                    "body": "Throughout the regular season, each Monday morning, I would call one of my buddies and we would create our own NFL Power Rankings. This list would only be 7-10 teams long. It would usually go something like this:\n\nRemember, through week 5, most of these teams were undefeated. Yes, including Atlanta. A few positions in our ranking were consistent week in and week out. We would always agree that New England was #1, because they had the best record, they were the defending champions, and yes, they get the benefit of the doubt. As a Carolina fan, I would always suggest that we rank Carolina the lowest of the undefeated teams in our hierarchy, because well, they get the opposite treatment of New England. The Panthers DO NOT get the benefit of the doubt... and they did play some weaker teams in the first few weeks. Also, I'm an \"objective\" Panthers fan. I wasn't going to rank them higher than other undefeated teams until they PROVED they were better. OK... I also didn't want to jinx them... of course.\n\nThe other team we would agree on each week was Denver. We would always rank them as the worst \"good team.\" They consistently looked AWFUL while winning games. They kept sneaking by and found a way to win games with their defense. Now here we are in February and lo and behold the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers are in the Super Bowl. All year I was complaining about how Carolina got no respect and was consistently being described as the worst undefeated team in NFL history. In fact, most people didn't give the Panthers the credit that they deserved until after Carolina knocked out the NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks AND the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nThat being said, the only team in the NFL that has been doubted MORE than Carolina is the Denver Broncos. How did they get here again? How did they somehow get past surging Kansas City, a dangerous Pittsburgh team, a talented and balanced Cincinnati Bengals team, and the class of the NFL... the New England Patriots? What are we to make of the Denver Broncos? I have no idea. Let's find out.\n\nAfter mining through data for hours, I found that there were very few pieces of evidence that support any theory of \"how to beat Denver\" or \"how they lose.\" Why? Well, for starters, they ran two different offenses (the Gary Kubiak play-action offense and the Peyton Manning \"OMAHAAAAA\" offense), and they played with two different quarterbacks. Additionally, they have one of the best defenses in the league, which covered up a lot of deficiencies. They also got healthy towards the end of the season while the rest of AFC got banged up.\n\nNew England lost Julian Edelman until the post-season. Gronk was in and out. And the New England offensive line... good God, the offensive line...\n\nCincinnati looked like the most balanced team in the AFC all year. They could have absolutely been in the Super Bowl, but Andy Dalton got injured and the team resorted to acting like, well... the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nPittsburgh lost Le'Veon Bell early on, but Deangelo Williams stepped in and stepped up. Then he got hurt too. Big Ben separated his shoulder and Antonio Brown got \"Vontaze Burficted.\" Down goes Pittsburgh.\n\nSo, Denver somehow snagged the #1 seed in the AFC, got a bye, got some rest, beat a decimated Pittsburgh team, and BARELY beat the worst New England team we've seen in years. So THAT is how they got here. They got a little bit healthier and the AFC crumbled around them.\n\nWhen the Opposition Runs the Ball Well Against Denver\n\nThat being said, I still wanted to see if I could find any pattern to how teams succeed against Denver. We know that Denver has an excellent defense, supposedly the best in the league. We certainly know that they have the best pass rush in the league based on their league-leading 52 sacks. Naturally, one would think that the Carolina Panthers have the perfect kryptonite for an opposing team's pass rush. Carolina has the best running game in the NFL. I took a look at Denver's regular season to see how they fared against teams who ran the ball for over 100 yards. Denver went 12-4 in the regular season. When the opposing team ran for over 100 yards, Denver went 5-2. They went 7-2 when the opposition ran for less than 100 yards. So, that isn't telling us too much.\n\nWe know that Denver has a less than impressive passing offense and a quarterback who physically has difficulty throwing the ball. It would be logical to assume that they play better when they have a good day running the ball. When Denver ran the ball for over 100 yards they went 8-1. When Denver ran for LESS than 100 yards, Denver went 3-4. This is one of the most consistent statistics that I can find when it relates to Denver losses. If Carolina wants to win this game, they can't let Denver have a good day running.\n\nThis is the most telling statistic of the lot. Denver threw a league-high 17 interceptions. They were -4 in turnover differential during the regular season, tied for 19th in the league, YET they only lost the turnover battle in 6 games out of 18 (regular season & post-season games combined). In those 6 games, they went 3-3. When Denver has won the turnover battle, they went 7-0. When they \"pushed\" in the turnover battle, they went 4-1. I think you see the pattern. Carolina needs to win the turnover battle to increase their chances to win this game. Interestingly enough, Peyton Manning has not thrown an interception in the postseason. He did have one fumble, technically, when he threw a backwards pass to RB Ronnie Hillman which was incomplete, challenged, and ruled a fumble. Nonetheless, it looks like they've gone out of their way to protect the ball and rely on their defense. If Carolina gets some points on the board early, this could force Denver to come out of their defensive shell and lead to opportunities for the Carolina defense.\n\nAlthough the inconsistencies in the Denver offense make it difficult to determine exactly how they lose, we can see some evidence of how the opposition has been successful against them in the past. Running the ball well against Denver will certainly go a long way towards slowing down the Broncos pass rush. However, it seems it is more important for Carolina to slow down Denver's rushing offense. This has been a better predictor of the outcomes of games. Lastly, it is imperative that Carolina win the turnover battle. If they don't, this game could be a lot closer than we would like it to be.\n\nDo I think Carolina can lose the turnover battle and still beat the Denver Broncos? Yes. But, we would be the first team to do so this year.",

                    "body": "Denver Broncos outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, right, celebrates a fumble recovery with outside linebacker Von Miller, left, during the NFL football divisional playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, Jan. 17, 2016. (Joe Mahoney/AP)\n\nTime was, the team with Peyton Manning under centre would be the unstoppable offensive juggernaut, and it would be up to its opponent to open up the bag of tricks to try to keep pace with a high-powered offence. Time was, Manning's margin for error would be wide, with a mere two-minute drill often all that was required to drop a quick six points on an overmatched defence, then hand the ball back to his counterpart with a \"Top that!\" smirk.\n\nThat time was... at least a year ago. That time is gone forever. But all is not lost.\n\nThe Denver Broncos that face the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 will have an ancient quarterback, the popgun-iest (if you'll pardon the phrase) offence the Super Bowl has seen in a decade and a razor-thin margin for error. Not much can go wrong for the Broncos and still leave them with a chance at an upset.\n\nBut hey -- that was the prevailing wisdom going into the AFC championship game, too, and Denver managed to gut that one out.\n\nSo here we go, a five-step plan that gives the Broncos a win and a bunch of lucky gamblers a nice payday. But please, I'm not a football coach, just a guy looking at some stats and news reports -- and I definitely wouldn't go betting the house on Denver.\n\n1. Start fast.\n\nThe Panthers have crushed their way through these playoffs by burying teams early. Both Seattle and Arizona found themselves forced into desperation mode before halftime. Denver's offence does not have a desperation mode, because they are just desperately trying to move the football at all. It's hard enough for them with no deficit and they're not going to be in a good place if they're trying to catch up against the Carolina defence.\n\nAll that makes an early touchdown or two not just an objective, but a necessity. Despite the assumption he would be little more than a game manager, Manning actually looked downfield early in the AFC title game, racking up both his touchdowns and 124 of his 176 passing yards before halftime, and the Broncos were rewarded with a lead they could defend. That lead forced the Patriots to attempt deeper throws and created time and opportunity for Denver's dominant pass rush and secondary.\n\n2. Get Von Miller into great matchups.\n\nCarolina has a solid offensive line, sure, but it's not as dominant as it looked against Arizona in the NFC title game. Newton can be disrupted, and pressured, and sacked. And the most likely man to do it is Miller, who caused havoc against the Patriots and is benefiting from DeMarcus Ware's return, which forces defences to key on both rushing linebackers. Per Pro Football Focus, Miller rushes from the left side of the line 73 percent of the time, and his 70 pressures from that side are more than anyone else in the NFL.\n\nDefending Newton on that side will be right tackle Mike Remmers, one of the league's worst O-linemen in pass protection. If Miller can make Remmers into a turnstile, he'll be in Cam's kitchen all day, and those deep balls to Ted Ginn and Corey Brown won't have time to develop. Which is good, because Denver simply can't keep up in a game of long passes.\n\n3. Win the turnover battle.\n\nTechnically this is a key to every single game of football, but it's even more pronounced on Sunday. Despite having the league's best defence, the Broncos finished minus-four in turnovers, 20th in the NFL. The Panthers? First, with a plus-20 number. So on that count, it seems hopeless -- but wait! Much of the Broncos' negative number was rung up during the first nine weeks of the season, when Manning was playing both a) hurt and b) absolutely horrendously, racking up an NFL-leading 17 interceptions. While his arm strength hasn't magically returned after his seven-week rehab, Manning has certainly been much more careful with the football since re-taking the starting job.\n\nIf Manning can avoid throwing the ball to his opponents (not an easy task, as the Panthers defenders' 24 total picks led the league by a wide margin), that takes a huge chunk out of what looks like a major deficit on paper. It's a big 'if,' sure, but this whole game is a big 'if' for Denver. Don't cough up the football, make the Panthers work for field position, see what happens.\n\n4. Don't be fooled in the run game.\n\nCarolina throws more strange rushing plays at their opponents than any team in recent memory. The Broncos were the third-best in the NFL during the season at defending the run, but they didn't really face many multi-faceted rushing units -- Denver's two division games against Alex Smith were the only times they faced a QB who rushed with any frequency.\n\nNewton and the Panthers -- who often use the three-headed monster of Cam, Jonathan Stewart and Mike Tolbert in the backfield as a triple option -- represent a whole different ballgame. Carolina has been successful when its opponents get suckered into charging upfield to stop a Stewart run, only to realize Newton, or Tolbert, has the ball. Denver has an excellent D-line, as well as fast linebackers who tackle well, and if they can be patient they are capable of neutralizing the Panthers' tricks. But only if -- there's that word again -- they don't get ahead of themselves.\n\n5. Get big plays from big players.\n\nSure, sure -- another key that would be a key to any game. But the difference is that Denver hasn't had much of this at all from any of its truly big guns. Emmanuel Sanders had a highlight-reel catch against the Patriots and CJ Anderson broke off one long run, but other than that Denver's big-money guys have gone missing. Demaryius Thomas: Two catches for 12 yards against New England. Take away Anderson's 30-yard run and he carried 15 times for 42 yards, or just under three per tote. Hillman was even worse, with 11 carries for 16 yards, and Sanders had just four grabs for 28 yards outside of his 34-yard beauty.\n\nThis bookends our first point nicely: Denver needs to be aggressive, because it's likely going to take at least 27 or 30 points to win this Super Bowl, and probably more. In order for Denver to be aggressive, some of its offensive weapons need to win one-on-one battles. If they don't, well, Carolina's overall depth will probably overwhelm them.",

Individual glory manifests fantasy football championships, but the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos made Super Bowl 50 due to team-wide domination.\n\nSome of the best stat lines ever didn't procure titles for Peyton Manning, but the legendary quarterback can end the worst season of his storied career on top. It's possible Denver prevails. Just don't expect a fairy-tale ending of the 39-year-old suddenly turning back the clock and churning out one last memorable outing.\n\nCounting two impressive playoff performances, Cam Newton has collected 50 total touchdowns through 18 games. Yet, Carolina is not buoyed by a star-studded cast of skill players. Instead, it is fueled by a menacing offensive line and defense whose accomplishments shouldn't get discredited when juxtaposed against Denver's top-ranked unit.\n\nNeither side will light up the scoreboard, but the Panthers won't need another 49-point display to beat Manning's Broncos.\n\nSuper Bowl Preview and Prediction Date Time (ET) Matchup TV Prediction Sun., Feb. 7 6:30 p.m. Carolina Panthers vs. Denver Broncos CBS 24-16 CAR\n\nAuthor's Prediction\n\nPanthers\n\nPanthers' Box-Score Predictions Player Predictions QB Cam Newton 16-27, 220 YD, 1 TD, 45 Rush YD, 1 TD RB Jonathan Stewart 20 Rush, 78 YD, 1 TD WR Ted Ginn Jr. 5 TAR, 1 REC, 25 YD WR Corey Brown 6 TAR, 4 REC, 60 YD WR Devin Funchess 3 TAR, 2 REC, 20 YD TE Greg Olsen 11 TAR, 7 REC, 90 YD, 1 TD DT Kawann Short 3 TCK, 1 Sack LB Luke Kuechly 8 TCK, 1 INT LB Thomas Davis 7 TCK, 1 Sack FS Kurt Coleman 6 TCK, 1 PD, 1 INT\n\nAuthor's predictions\n\nIt turns out Denver's defense is really good. During the season, it allowed a league-low 6.2 yards per pass attempt and 3.3 yards per rush, leading to an NFL-best 283.1 yards relinquished per game. Although the Broncos dodged a bullet by facing an injured Ben Roethlisberger without DeAngelo Williams and Antonio Brown, the New England Patriots had no such excuse.\n\nSo how does Carolina handle a defense that established permanent residency in Tom Brady's pocket? Probably better than the Pats did.\n\nShare Tweet Embed\n\nNo defense can match the Broncos, who boast both a ferocious front seven and two lockdown cornerbacks in Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib. Yet, the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals weren't exactly the New Orleans Saints in terms of stopping offenses. Against the season's No. 2 and 5 defenses, respectively, the Panthers established an effective, balanced attack.\n\nNewton carried over his late-season surge versus elite competition. The quarterback completed 70 percent of his passes, averaging 9.92 yards per pass. His MVP case was faulty midway through the regular season, but the 26-year-old has since earned every bit of praise directed his way:\n\nCam Newton's Last 10 Games CMP % PASS YPG YPA PASS TD INT RUSH YD RUSH TD 71.3 2,513 9.01 24 2 343 7\n\nESPN.com\n\nNewton also enjoys a luxury unavailable to Russell Wilson or Carson Palmer. He doesn't have Larry Fitzgerald or even Doug Baldwin at wideout, but Greg Olsen provides a true difference-maker at tight end. The Broncos aren't necessarily vulnerable to the position, but they're slightly less unstoppable.\n\nPer Football Outsiders, they yielded 61.7 yards per game to tight ends during the season, not counting Rob Gronkowski's 144 yards during the AFC Championship Game. No. 1 wide receivers gained one fewer yard per contest, not that Carolina carries a true top wideout anyway. Maybe Ted Ginn Jr. lands one huge play, but he's also just as likely to not catch a single pass.\n\nOlsen, meanwhile, is a steady presence. After entering the playoffs with a team-high 77 receptions and 1,104 yards, he compiled consecutive six-catch games against Seattle and Arizona. As noted by ESPN Stats & Info, it's rare but not unprecedented for a tight end to headline a championship passing attack:\n\nGreg Olsen could become 4th TE ever to lead a Super Bowl-winning team in rec and rec yards (Shannon Sharpe, Mark Bavaro, Todd Christensen) -- ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo)\n\nJanuary 26, 2016\n\nMeanwhile, the running backs left standing on Pittsburgh and New England make Jonathan Stewart look like Emmitt Smith. Refreshed from a month off, the veteran running back registered 189 yards on 38 postseason handoffs, creating a threat for Denver's defense to assess.\n\nHe won't carve out gaping holes on the ground, but Carolina won't need him to. Unlike New England's offensive line, Carolina's blockers will give Newton a fighting chance to make enough plays with his arm and legs. If the Panthers push past 20 points -- below their usual baseline -- they'll engineer enough scoring to prevail.\n\nBroncos\n\nBroncos' Box-Score Predictions Player Predictions QB Peyton Manning 19-33, 205 YD, 1 TD, 2 INT RB C.J.

They have now won eight of Manning's 12 starts by seven points or less, averaging 22.7 points per contest. In order for them to hoist the Lombardi Trophy, they will need to win ugly one more time.\n\nFiveThirtyEight.com's Neil Paine gave Denver fans goods news and bad news. First, the bad: Although he's arguably the greatest of all time, Peyton's current Super Bowl form is on par with that of Rex Grossman leading the Chicago Bears to the 2007 title game, which they lost to Manning's Indianapolis Colts back when he was still Manning. Paine's study labeled Manning's per-play performance this season as the worst ever by a Super Bowl quarterback.\n\nOn the bright side, Paine doesn't believe that's enough to disqualify the Broncos:\n\nWhether you look at total or per-attempt measures of value, there's essentially zero correlation between the disparity in regular-season QB performance for the Super Bowl opponents and the eventual point margin of the game itself. This makes sense, as the equilibrium of a successful team will account for poor play from any given position (even QB) if the rest of the team is strong enough.\n\nIt certainly is reason to worry, though. Relentless ball hawks, the Panthers have recorded 30 interceptions in 18 games. Manning, meanwhile, didn't go a full game without donating a pick before doing it twice this postseason. If he dares to challenge Josh Norman, the star cornerback at least plans to honor the legend, as he relayed to ESPN.com's Jeremy Fowler:\n\nHe's 'The Sheriff,' man. I've admired him since I grew up. I have a lot of respect for that guy. ... Even though he's got some age on him, he's 'The Sheriff.' If I even get the ball from him, if he throws an interception or something and the guy allows me to be there for it, I'm probably going to bow to him. That's how much I really think about a guy.\n\nWhether it's Norman, Kurt Coleman, Luke Kuechly or someone else, don't be surprised if Carolina alters the game with a key turnover or two.\n\nGiven Manning's limitations, a strong ground game is crucial to Denver's success. Per Pro Football Focus, the veteran quarterback is at his best when springing off the rushing attack:\n\nWhen using play action Peyton Manning's passer rating jumps 25 points (62.8 to 87.8) + YPA soars from 6.1 to 9.4. #Broncos need the run game -- Pro Football Focus (@PFF)\n\nFebruary 1, 2016\n\nHey there, Gary Kubiak. If you happen to be reading this, you might want to go ahead and stop splitting carries between C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman. While the former recorded two straight 72-yard outings out of the timeshare, the latter turned 11 handoffs into 16 yards against New England.\n\nThe Cardinals' high-octane passing offense seemed like the perfect candidate to exploit Carolina, but their three top wideouts (Larry Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd and John Brown) combined for 90 yards on nine catches. Norman should monitor No. 1 receiver Demaryius Thomas, and linebackers Kuechly and Thomas Davis won't let tight end Owen Daniels snag another two scores. Look for Manning to target Emmanuel Sanders heavily but not with enough success downfield to muster an upset.",

                    "title": "Comment on Sights and sounds from Super Bowl 50 media day by floki",
                    "body": "The NFL would like us to call it \"Opening Night.\" That's the official name now, but everyone who's ever covered the Super Bowl, still calls it \"media day.\"\n\nThe new name does seem appropriate, however, as there are some undeniable truths that come along with the new moniker. First, \"Opening\" seems about right, since this event generally seems to kick off Super Bowl week. Second, it's no longer done during the day; now it's done at night (see what they did there?). And lastly, and perhaps most importantly...\n\n...this event is hardly intended for media.\n\nAnd that brings me to my list: 10 observations - the sights and sounds - from media day, err, \"Opening Night.\"\n\nNo. 1: Media has been redefined. Sure, there are media members - writers, reporters, television folk - in attendance. But let's be honest, this is a circus. I'm not sure how credentials are awarded, but having journalistic qualities, or any intention of reporting on football, are clearly not mandatory criteria. That might sound stuffy - although it's not meant to - but it's really true. The zanier the better. Costumes, themes, silly questions about anything and everything other than football, and Miss Universe, Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach, who was hired by \"Inside Edition\" - all of that and then some. Hey, I've got no problem with it, but again, omitting the word \"media\" is definitely appropriate.\n\nNo. 2: Phil Simms doesn't hate Denver. In truth, I learned this before departing for \"Opening Night.\" I found Simms to not only be engaging and insightful, but also kind and generous with his time. Simms was even asked if he didn't like certain places - like Denver, for example - and he basically said he valued his job too much to sway too far from \"unbiased.\" In a side conversation, CBS sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson alluded to the fact that every city believes that her co-worker hates them too. Why does Phil Simms hate Denver? He doesn't; he just has an amazing, unintentional ability to make every fan think that he hates them, their team and their city. Call it a rare quality.\n\nNo. 3: Like everyone else, Mike Carey, has trouble with NFL rules. Yesterday, CBS trotted out its full lineup of talent, which includes former official Mike Carey. His job, as we hear during practically every big game on CBS, is to interpret an on-field ruling or try to predict whether or not a challenge will be overruled. Carey seems like a real nice fellow, but he was under fire yesterday, being peppered with questions about the rules. He did his best to answer them, and I suppose he did so proficiently, but it's pretty obvious that America has some questions about how the game is governed these days. Don't shoot the messenger though (i.e. don't be mad at Carey). It's not his fault the game's rules are so convoluted that zero armchair quarterbacks understand them. Someone asked Cam Newton what rule he would change, if any. He told them he'd change the rule that dictated the kind (and color) of cleats players could wear. Really? I'm with him (let's make it fun, Roger), but my guess is that Cam doesn't understand the \"real\" rules any more than you or me or Mike Carey.\n\nNo. 4: Peyton Manning is a cool dude. No, really. Not in the sense that \"Von Miller is cool in his sweet glasses\" cool, but - like - really cool. How do I know this? Because of what Jordan Taylor told Mile High Sports reporter Robin Carlin Monday. If you don't know Taylor, he's Manning's \"favorite\" receiver; it was Taylor, a member of the Broncos practice squad, who worked out with Manning while he was recovering from a foot injury this season. Anyway, Taylor supposedly asked Manning if he happened to have an \"old\" suit he might borrow, because, you know, the Super Bowl is kind of a big deal, so he wanted to look sharper than his salary might allow. Well, Manning did him one better. He had Taylor measured for a custom suit, had it made and picked up the tab. (Pretty damn cool, right?) Taylor never played a down for the Broncos during the regular season, but perhaps his contributions during Manning's time of need will make the difference in the old man riding off into the sunset with a new ring. Hey, that'd be worth a new slick, custom, grey suit.\n\nNo. 5: That said, Nick Kasa is \"the most popular practice squad player in the history of the Super Bowl.\" And that's a quote - from him. The Legacy High School and University of Colorado product was joking of course, but there's some truth to this claim. He's got a great story - from being a fan at the AFC Championship Game to getting a call from the Broncos requesting his presence at the Super Bowl. The media picked up on that storyline and Kasa became somewhat of a media day darling. But let's get something straight: Kasa is no charity case. The Denver defense wanted someone who could closely resemble Panthers tight end Greg Olsen - one of the game's very best - so they called Kasa. He's big and he's fast and he looks like he hasn't taken a snap off since 6th grade. Kasa has overcome a lot in his career - a serious knee injury at CU, switching from defensive end (he was recruited as one of the very best pass-rushing preps in the country) to tight end, then sitting out the entire 2014 season after tearing his ACL in camp with the Cowboys. Personally, I think Owen Daniels should buy him a suit.\n\nNo. 6: Oh, and speaking of tight ends, former Chief and Falcon Tony Gonzalez dissed the Denver tight ends (sort of). When asked about the matchup of tight ends, Gonzalez told Carlin, \"There's only one,\" referring of course, to Greg Olsen. Sure, Olsen is the one of the best tight ends in the game (we wouldn't argue with Gonzalez there), but \"only one?\" I guess Gonzalez missed Owen Daniels - the human highlight reel himself - in the AFC Championship Game. Daniels was pretty damn good, good enough to draw a comparison to Olsen. Our guy is just \"different\" - like our offense, he's not as flashy, but he's very effective. Broncos fans can live with that. As we learned in Super Bowl XLVIII, \"flash\" is overrated.\n\nNo. 7: The Panthers are likeable. I hate to say it - I'd so much rather not like them (see Seattle) - but it's true. If the Broncos weren't in the Super Bowl, us folk from Denver might very well be rooting for Carolina. They've got likable veterans like Thomas Davis and Ryan Kalil, and a fun quarterback in Cam Newton. Their coach has an intriguing story (he was nearly canned not that long ago). And players talk about ownership much like the Broncos talk about Mr. Bowlen. So, today's mission? Find a Panther who's a total jerk; that way we have someone to root against.\n\nNo. 8: Jerry Rice is still the GOAT. The crowd on hand at the SAP Center in San Jose made a lot of noise, but the loudest arrived when former 49er (and Bronco... remember that?) swiped a throwback 'Niners jersey from a fan and ran around like a crazy man pumping up the crowd. Think about it this way, Denver: Rice is their Elway. The guy is gold and still beloved like the days when he ruled Candlestick. And, like the aforementioned Kasa, Rice - at age 53 - also looks like he hasn't missed a beat. I'd bet $5 he can still run a post route that would juke most safeties, and I'd bet my life he hasn't had to pay for dinner in San Francisco since he retired.\n\nNo. 9: Denver won the bling game. Is bling still a thing? Someone on the bus ride home said the Broncos were \"icier.\" That works, too. Tom Shane might need to get back to Antwerp, because it would appear the Broncos raided him of all his diamonds and gold before departing. From thick gold chains (\"Cuban Links\" if you'd rather) to boulder-sized rock studs, Denver was blinged out - far more than the Panthers. There was so much jewelry on hand, that Wade Phillips donned Aqib Talib's gold chain for a bit; the only thing shinier on Phillips was his silver hair.\n\nNo. 10: And that brings me to my most important observation: The Broncos are far more \"loose\" than they were in New York. And that's a good thing. One of my most vivid memories of covering Super Bowl 48 was how out of sorts the Denver Broncos were. They seemed tighter than a fiddle string. That team was built on perfection. They shattered a bevy of NFL offensive records behind a quarterback that was the tightest of them all. But this year, it looks like even Manning is having fun. He's joking around and keeping things light. He looks like the guy in the Nationwide commercials, not like a guy who's queasy from either having to answer questions about retiring after the greatest statistical season ever or from having to answer them on a boat. Manning is getting the \"retirement\" question as expected, but oddly, that's not much of a story this time around. Manning dismisses it and gets back to being his fun-loving self. And it looks as if that's rubbing off on his team. The Broncos are a team that looks as if it has a sincere appreciation for being here this time around. Oddly, the roles have been reversed from Super Bowl 48. Denver comes in as the underdog (no pressure, they're not supposed to win, right?) behind a physical defense with plenty of swagger. Sounds like the 2013 Seahawks to me. And we all know what the Seahawks went on to do.",

                    "body": "Denver Broncos' Vernon Davis was interviewed during Opening Night for Super Bowl 50, Monday, in San Jose, Calif.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. \" Vernon Davis got to sleep at home for a night in the Bay Area, stay in the same hotel where he lived during 49ers training camp last summer, and the equipment staff even promised him his old locker at Levi's Stadium this weekend.\n\nNo matter that he might play a bit part in this Super Bowl for the Denver Broncos, Davis is back where he has made a home for more than a decade and ready to win a championship ring after coming up just short three years ago with San Francisco.\n\nIt just so happened he arrived Sunday for Super Bowl week on his 32nd birthday, too.\n\n\"It hasn't been that long since I left here, so it kind of seems like I was just here,\" said Davis, who was traded from the 49ers to the Broncos on Nov. 2. \"I'll look around a little bit and get a gauge on things and I'll come to the realization that I'm actually playing in the Super Bowl at Levi's Stadium.\"\n\nThe veteran tight end has had discussions with many a teammate already on the importance that they \"just stay together, just stay in this moment, and don't get caught up on the outside because the moment you do there's a lot of risk.\"\n\nDavis didn't even have plans to stop by the Jamba Juice store he owns.\n\nHe would love nothing more than to leave his mark on this Super Bowl, somehow. Even if he has played all of 11 snaps this postseason with one target and no catches.\n\n\"You haven't seen me but there's a chance that you could see me,\" he said. \"I don't know. I'm all about faith, anything could happen just like that. The moment it does, I have to take advantage of my opportunities. They will come. ... I'm a patient guy and I'm ready whenever the opportunity presents itself.\"\n\nDavis' short time in the offense -- and playing with two different quarterbacks in Peyton Manning and backup Brock Osweiler -- made for a challenging transition to his new team.\n\nAccording to Football Perspective, Davis is one of just four players to have competed in home games on the Super Bowl field during the regular season then return for the championship game with a different team.\n\nFor Davis, that three-point loss to Baltimore in the Super Bowl following the 2012 season has stuck with him -- just as it has for many of his former 49ers teammates.\n\n\"It just weighs heavy on you when you make it to the Super Bowl and you can't pull off the victory,\" Davis said. \"It's not a good feeling at all. I stressed that to some of my teammates, I wanted to make them aware of what it can feel like if things didn't go our way -- just give them that fire and that motivation.\"\n\nHe has watched Manning so intently the past couple of months to learn whatever he can from the five-time NFL MVP, noting, \"I even picked the seat beside him in the team meeting room just to get his energy.\"\n\nDavis matched his career high with 13 touchdown receptions in 2013, and believes he can still be that dominant again. He has had tough stretches before when he didn't get as many chances as he'd like.\n\nWhen someone suggested that Sunday might be his final game, Davis chuckled, \"Oh, come on, man, no way, no way.\"\n\n\"As long as I can run a 4.3 or a 4.4 I'm going to continue to play the game. When that leaves, then I'll stop playing,\" said Davis, who is still running a 4.3-second 40-yard dash. \"I'm leaving on my own terms, most definitely.\"\n\nDavis' experience in big games and athleticism is a big reason Denver acquired him.\n\n\"He's brought that,\" general manager John Elway said. \"Obviously, the play time's been up and down, but he's made some big catches for us. He came in in a short window, too, so trying to get him comfortable with the offense, what we're doing, and also it was right around the time that Brock started and came in. He's always there, he's always a threat and the defense always has to worry about him.\"\n\nDavis has been providing his share of insight already about how it felt to come so close and lose on the NFL's biggest stage. His versatility also has allowed the Broncos to run more two- and three-tight end sets.\n\n\"Vernon's a heck of a player. We came in together '06 class, so 10 years in the game for him,\" Broncos tight end Owen Daniels said. \"A ton of playoff experience, Super Bowl experience, that can't be overlooked in terms of being able to relay that to guys and kind of alert us to what might be going on during the week. He lives around the corner from here. He's great for this week specifically. He's been a great addition to our team.\"",

This is like a younger team.\n\n\"The team that I left, it was a lot of older guys with families, but these guys are younger guys.\n\n\"When I first got into the locker room, I said, 'They joke a lot. They play around a lot.' I am always serious, but I had to sort of let my guard down a little bit.\n\n\"But that's where the closeness came. When you think about the team and getting to know the guys off the field and doing the little small things, that's what matters.\"\n\nWare is regarded as one of the best linebackers of his generation - but has been forced to wait for his first taste of the Super Bowl and is determined to make the most of it.",

                    "body": "SAN JOSE, California -- Vernon Davis got to sleep at home for a night in the Bay Area, stay in the same hotel where he lived during 49ers training camp last summer, and the equipment staff even promised him his old locker at Levi's Stadium this weekend.\n\nNo matter that he might play a bit part in this Super Bowl for the Denver Broncos, Davis is back where he has made a home for more than a decade and ready to win a championship ring after coming up just short three years ago with San Francisco.\n\nIt just so happened he arrived Sunday for Super Bowl week on his 32nd birthday, too.\n\n\"It hasn't been that long since I left here, so it kind of seems like I was just here,\" said Davis, who was traded from the 49ers to the Broncos on Nov. 2. \"I'll look around a little bit and get a gauge on things and I'll come to the realization that I'm actually playing in the Super Bowl at Levi's Stadium.\"\n\nThe veteran tight end has had discussions with many a teammate already on the importance that they \"just stay together, just stay in this moment, and don't get caught up on the outside because the moment you do there's a lot of risk.\"\n\nDavis didn't even have plans to stop by the Jamba Juice store he owns.\n\nHe would love nothing more than to leave his mark on this Super Bowl, somehow. Even if he has played all of 11 snaps this postseason with one target and no catches.\n\n\"You haven't seen me but there's a chance that you could see me,\" he said. \"I don't know. I'm all about faith, anything could happen just like that. The moment it does, I have to take advantage of my opportunities. They will come. ... I'm a patient guy and I'm ready whenever the opportunity presents itself.\"\n\nDavis' short time in the offense -- and playing with two different quarterbacks in Peyton Manning and backup Brock Osweiler -- made for a challenging transition to his new team.\n\nAccording to Football Perspective, Davis is one of just four players to have competed in home games on the Super Bowl field during the regular season then return for the championship game with a different team.\n\nFor Davis, that three-point loss to Baltimore in the Super Bowl following the 2012 season has stuck with him -- just as it has for many of his former 49ers teammates.\n\n\"It just weighs heavy on you when you make it to the Super Bowl and you can't pull off the victory,\" Davis said. \"It's not a good feeling at all. I stressed that to some of my teammates, I wanted to make them aware of what it can feel like if things didn't go our way -- just give them that fire and that motivation.\"\n\nHe has watched Manning so intently the past couple of months to learn whatever he can from the five-time NFL MVP, noting, \"I even picked the seat beside him in the team meeting room just to get his energy.\"\n\nDavis matched his career high with 13 touchdown receptions in 2013, and believes he can still be that dominant again. He has had tough stretches before when he didn't get as many chances as he'd like.\n\nWhen someone suggested that Sunday might be his final game, Davis chuckled, \"Oh, come on, man, no way, no way.\"\n\n\"As long as I can run a 4.3 or a 4.4 I'm going to continue to play the game. When that leaves, then I'll stop playing,\" said Davis, who is still running a 4.3-second 40-yard dash. \"I'm leaving on my own terms, most definitely.\"\n\nDavis' experience in big games and athleticism is a big reason Denver acquired him.\n\n\"He's brought that,\" general manager John Elway said. \"Obviously, the play time's been up and down, but he's made some big catches for us. He came in in a short window, too, so trying to get him comfortable with the offense, what we're doing, and also it was right around the time that Brock started and came in. He's always there, he's always a threat and the defense always has to worry about him.\"\n\nDavis has been providing his share of insight already about how it felt to come so close and lose on the NFL's biggest stage. His versatility also has allowed the Broncos to run more two- and three-tight end sets.\n\n\"Vernon's a heck of a player. We came in together '06 class, so 10 years in the game for him,\" Broncos tight end Owen Daniels said. \"A ton of playoff experience, Super Bowl experience, that can't be overlooked in terms of being able to relay that to guys and kind of alert us to what might be going on during the week. He lives around the corner from here. He's great for this week specifically. He's been a great addition to our team.\"",

USA TODAY Sports\n\n10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. - Sorry, Demaryius. Move over Emmanuel.\n\nPeyton Manning might have a new favorite wide receiver, and it's a player you likely have never heard of.\n\nIt's possible that no one on the Denver Broncos roster caught more passes from Manning this year or was more important to Manning's late-season return from a torn plantar fascia in his left foot than Jordan Taylor, a rookie from Rice and member of the practice squad.\n\nWhen Manning needed a throwing partner for his early morning workouts in early December, when the rest of the team was practicing without him, he'd text Taylor, who would show up hours early for work to run through any route the quarterback wanted. It meant the equivalent of almost two full practices a day for Taylor.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBroncos GM John Elway's Super Bowl advice to Peyton Manning: 'Stay in the moment'\n\nWhen Manning put himself through a long pregame workout before the Week 17 season finale against the San Diego Chargers, the first game of Manning's NFL career in which he suited up as a backup, it was Taylor running through a series of different routes.\n\n\"I feel bad because I was running him into the ground and he hadn't even started practice yet,\" Manning said. \"I have a bad habit of saying, just one more, and one more can turn into 10 more. I don't think I could have gotten though my rehab and gotten back if he had not been for him. I am very grateful for his help.\"\n\nOn Sunday, before Super Bowl 50, it will be Taylor on the field several hours before the game going through pregame warmups with Manning.\n\n\"It's a nice reminder of kind of where we've been this season, earlier in the year. I look forward to that,\" Manning said.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWade Phillips: 'Quit Twittering me' for spot on Broncos\n\nThat will be Taylor's big Super Bowl moment, running routes on the field at Levi's Stadium hours before any of the television cameras turn on and the fans fill the stands. But it's already been a memorable week, one that started with his packing dilemma before the team left Denver.\n\nIt was Taylor's first road trip of the season, because practice squad players don't travel, and he realized he didn't own a suit suitable for the team's charter flight to San Jose.\n\nSo he texted Manning.\n\n\"Do you have any old suits?\" Taylor asked.\n\nBoth Manning and Taylor are 6-foot-5, and though Manning is 20 pounds heavier, Taylor figured he could make do with a hand-me-down.\n\n\"He texts me back and all he said was, 'I'll get you set up,'\" Taylor told USA TODAY Sports. \"I didn't know what that meant.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n49 memorable moments, fun facts from every Super Bowl\n\nWhat it meant was Taylor was about to receive his first custom suit. Manning's suit guy showed up at the team facility in Englewood, Colo. the next day and took all of Taylor's measurements. The suit and a pair of shirts and ties arrived in time for the team's Sunday departure, and Taylor proudly wore the fitted gray suit - complete with an orange-and-blue tie and blue-and-white pocket square - on the team flight.\n\n\"He may have been one of the best dressed players on the team coming out here,\" Manning said. \"I just appreciate his help, and I'm excited about his career. He's a tall receiver, maybe the Eddie McCaffrey, Eric Decker-type mold, and I really think he's got a bright future ahead of him.\"\n\nAt Super Bowl 50's Opening Night on Monday, Taylor milled around the floor at the SAP Center in San Jose in his league-issued white pullover, his long curly blond hair pulled into a ponytail and tucked under a ball cap.\n\nHe kept gazing around the area, and up at the big screen to watch Broncos stars such as Manning and pass rusher DeMarcus Ware at their podiums.\n\nIt was just another surreal moment in what has been a unique rookie year, thanks in large part to Manning.\n\nThe bond between the 39-year-old future Hall of Fame quarterback and the 23-year-old undrafted wide receiver began last spring, when Manning invited Taylor to join him and some friends at a U2 concert. But it was cemented on the practice field, as Manning learned he could trust Taylor in practice nearly as much as star receivers Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders.\n\nAnd as much as Taylor helped Manning in those weeks Manning was sidelined, Taylor believes his game improved too, something that should help as he tries to make the Broncos' 53-man roster in 2016.\n\n\"While he was rehabbing and trying to get himself better, he was critiquing my routes, my technique, my knowledge of the offense,\" Taylor said. \"He definitely helped me out.\"\n\nFollow Lindsay H.

                    "body": "Are the Carolina Panthers really going to win the Super Bowl with Ted Ginn Jr as their number one wide receiver?\n\nThe Panthers have been the least heralded 17-1 team in NFL history, largely because nobody has believed in their skill position players.\n\nGreg Olsen is a monster, but outside of his star tight end, Cam Newton has mainly succeeded with scraps to work with on offence.\n\nJonathan Stewart is fine but unexceptional at running back, a 5'10 ground and pounder who has topped 1000 yards just once in his career. Ginn is a journeyman cast-off who has changed teams four times, Devin Funchess is a rookie, and Jerricho Cotchery featured in Madden '04.\n\nDenver's strongest hope for victory will come from the belief that their defence is so good and Carolina's offence is so dependent on Newton, with only Olsen talented enough to bail him out, that they'll be able to prevent the Panthers from putting up points.\n\nThe Broncos defence is the league's best by a significant margin, whether you're going by DVOA ranking or the eyeballs of any person who watched the AFC Championship game. Their offence is garbage that occasionally gets set on fire though, with the pungent fumes sailing through the air much faster than Peyton Manning's tragic floating passes that die on the road to nowhere.\n\nThe Broncos finished the year with the league's 25th ranked offence in DVOA, a ranking inflated by Brock Osweiler, who for all intents and purposes is a better quarterback than Manning in 2016. Before the five-time MVP was mercifully replaced by Osweiler against the Chiefs in Week 10, the Broncos had the league's worst offence.\n\nDenver isn't going to be able to score against Carolina's second-ranked defence. If they put up more than 14 points it will be a minor miracle. They couldn't get anything going on the ground against the Patriots and it's hard to see them having any more success against the Panthers. They'll have to hope that the brilliance of Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders and Owen Daniels can keep the chains moving and Manning has a couple of pearlers in him like last week's immaculately delivered second touchdown pass to Daniels.\n\nBut if Denver wins, it's not going to be because Manning found the fountain of youth. He is what he is at this stage, which statistically is the worst starting quarterback in the NFL. Sunday in San Francisco will represent the biggest gap in quality between starting quarterbacks at the big dance since Manning himself went up against Rex Grossman in 2006.\n\nWe have over a year's evidence to suggest that Manning has nothing left, but Denver just needs him to feign competence for one more week, as he did against Pittsburgh and New England. Denver needs to eke out 13 to 20 points against Carolina and then hope that its defence isn't just the best in the league, but one of the greatest of all time.\n\nWhat makes this Super Bowl fascinating is that after last week's performance, it's not unreasonable to think that Denver's D might just have all-time greatness in them.\n\nThere have been some legendary defensive performances in the playoffs in the 21st century. These Broncos know that all too well, having been obliterated by Seattle's ferocious defensive unit two years ago. The Ravens have had their share of transcendent defences, bludgeoning the Giants in 2000 and the Patriots in 2013. Wade Phillips' Denver defence seems to be in that calibre. While the Broncos might only have 13 points in them, they might be able to hold the Panthers to 10.\n\nCam Newton might be the NFL's best player, but that means little after the nightmare the Broncos defence put arguably the game's best ever quarterback through last week. Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware lived in the New England backfield all day, treating the Patriot offensive linemen like turnstiles. It wasn't entirely surprising - the Patriots have a bad offensive line, ranking 18th in the league for pass protection. Worryingly for Carolina, the Panthers are even worse, ranking 21st.\n\nPlaying in the putrid NFC South, Carolina had an easy schedule but they've still come up against a top-ten defence five times this season. The results: 31 and 27 points against Seattle, 49 against Arizona, 37 against Green Bay and 24 against Houston. Aside from their lone loss, a 20-13 defeat against Atlanta where Carolina had nothing tangible to play for, the Panthers haven't been kept below 20 points all season. That doesn't bode well for the Broncos, who will have few discernible avenues to 20 on Sunday.\n\nDenver will have to hope that its defence is historically great to the point of being the outlier that can contain Carolina. They should be confident in stopping Stewart on the ground, and if they can restrict Olsen then Newton will have few other places to turn. Denver got inside Brady's head with their ferocious pressure last week and they should be even more confident getting inside Newton's, playing in his first ever Super Bowl.\n\nIf Denver's defensive line can dominate Carolina's O-Line, the stellar secondary wraps a tight blanket over Carolina's limited receivers, and the pressure and lack of open men rattles Newton, then Denver can win. They have a slight edge in special teams, ranking 14th in DVOA against Carolina's 23rd ranked unit, and they'll need that edge to manifest in favourable field position.\n\nAll these things are eminently possible. Denver's defence is that good. They have karma on their side with the Manning fairytale narrative combined with the ugly stories about Carolina's players attacking Odell Beckham Jr with a slew of anti-gay slurs. Thomas Davis will likely be playing at half strength if he plays at all, and Denver has experience on their side.\n\nManning has played in more big games than anyone aside from the guy his team just knocked out, and Denver has Super Bowl experience from just two years ago. They were embarrassed that day, but that could be liberating this time around. They have nothing to lose and they won't be afraid. Carolina might be, and they have everything to lose.\n\nAnd in saying all this...\n\nPanthers by 10.",

USA TODAY Sports\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nIn the week leading up to Super Bowl 50, USA TODAY Sports will highlight five matchups that could help decide whether the Carolina Panthers or Denver Broncos prevail. In our third installment, we highlight the Panthers offensive line against the Broncos defensive line.\n\nConstant control at the line of scrimmage has given the Carolina offense the leeway it needed to flourish into one of the NFL's most intimidating attacks as well as the highest-scoring team in the NFL.\n\nIronically, the Panthers offensive line was expected to be a vulnerable area entering this season, as the team once again bypassed making a splashy signing or using the draft to acquire a high-profile left tackle to protect Cam Newton's blind side -- which veteran Michael Oher has nicely guarded in a bounce-back campaign. Overall, the front five has helped a team that ranks just 24th in the league in passing average more than 32 points, including postseason.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSuper Bowl 50 matchups: Broncos RB C.J. Anderson vs. Panthers' front seven\n\nImproved protection for Newton, who took just three hits in two playoff games, has helped keep the passing attack afloat. And even with Carolina's struggles at wide receiver after losing Kelvin Benjamin to a torn knee ligament in training camp, the offense trails only the Arizona Cardinals in percentage of passing attempts that yielded a first down.\n\nCarolina's line has also paved the way for Newton and Jonathan Stewart to engineer the NFL's second-ranked rushing attack and a league-high 19 touchdowns on the ground. Former undrafted free agent Andrew Norwell has held his own at left guard, while center Ryan Kalil and right guard Trai Turner both earned Pro Bowl selections.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSuper Bowl 50 matchups: Panthers TE Greg Olsen vs. Broncos safeties\n\nYet they'll be up against a Denver defense that allowed the fewest yards per carry (3.3) of any team. And though linebackers Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware receive top billing for their pass rush skills, the emergent defensive line has thrown off several of the league's top offenses.\n\nDefensive end Derek Wolfe consistently disrupted Tom Brady in the AFC Championship Game and ranks as one of the league's best run stuffers. Malik Jackson's ability to slip blockers on the interior could make him one of the offseason's most sought-after free agents.\n\nNose tackle Sylvester Williams, who is stout against the run, could be a handful for Kalil. Antonio Smith and Vance Walker are seasoned veterans who will provide valuable snaps to keep the starters fresh.\n\nDenver will need both to generate pressure consistently against Newton and Co. while also trying to keep the elusive quarterback hemmed into the pocket.\n\n***\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE",

                    "body": "Guess what? A big football game is happening this Sunday. (It's being aired on CBS, CNET's parent company.)\n\nIt's the 50th Super Bowl, the final game in the NFL season that determines who wins the shiny Lombardi trophy. It's about four hours long, it has a long halftime show, and everyone you know will be talking about it on everything.\n\nLet's assume you know how football works, just a bit. Hopefully. If not, at least you can follow along with a few of these points and notes, just to catch up on what this year's game is all about. If nothing else, consider this your crib sheet between appetizers.\n\n1. It's the old \"young guy prodigy vs. fabled old guy\" game\n\nThis year's game has the greatest age gap between QBs in a Super Bowl ever...13 years. Peyton Manning, the Broncos quarterback, is 39...the oldest starting QB in Super Bowl history. Cam Newton, the Carolina Panthers' quarterback is 26. There's the span of a bar mitzvah between them. It's the Millennials vs. old guard, or whatever you want to make of it. The Super Bowl's had a lot of these matchups: Kurt Warner vs. Ben Roethlisberger. Tom Brady vs. Russell Wilson. Russell Wilson vs. Peyton Manning. And now, this. Sometimes the old vets win, sometimes the young guns do.\n\nMore Super Bowl 50 coverage CBS Sports: Complete Super Bowl 50 coverage How to watch Super Bowl 50 on nearly any device How to get your TV ready for the Super Bowl Big screens for the big game Techiest Super Bowl ever: Silicon Valley's stadium girds for the big game 2. Carolina is this year's \"surprise\" team...but they're also the favorites\n\nNo one thought the Panthers would be in the Super Bowl, but they went ahead and strung together 15 wins...while staying unbeaten until after Christmas. And they've had super-dominant performances in the playoffs: they blew the Seattle Seahawks out of the water early, and destroyed the Arizona Cardinals. Everyone thinks Carolina will win: Vegas, Madden, and plenty of pundits.\n\n3. Denver was expected, but it's their defense that's awesome\n\nDenver looked awful for a lot of this year, especially Peyton Manning. But their defense has helped them win tons of games. Their 12-4 record, and their gritty playoff wins over Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots, have been about defense. Their defense was the best in the NFL and is one of the best, statistically, of all time. So, watch for that.\n\n4. Cam Newton is the big must-see superstar personality (and show-off)\n\nIn every way, Cam Newton's this year's Super Bowl star. He's a crazily athletic quarterback. He was drafted no. 1 overall in 2011. He runs for tons of touchdowns. He's gigantic. He was the league MVP. He's known for the wildest fashion since Joe Namath and over-the-top touchdown celebrations. He also has plenty of endorsement deals, and I bet you'll see him in tons of Super Bowl commercials. Some people get annoyed by all of this. Others think it's fun. Peyton Manning, SNL appearances aside, has a pretty boring in-game personality.\n\nInside the Super Bowl tech at Levi's Stadium... 1 - 5 of 12 Next Prev 5. Peyton Manning is the old legend who's taken a beating, going for one last shot\n\nPeyton Manning is a legendary quarterback. He was the no. 1 pick in 1998. (This is the first Super Bowl between quarterbacks picked no. 1 overall in the draft, just in case you were curious.) But this season he was awful. He was pulled out midyear with an injury, and backup QB Brock Osweiler won many of Denver's key November and December games. But Manning returned for the playoffs, winning both games. Will he do just enough to win? This is Peyton Manning's fourth Super Bowl, and he's won one, lost two. Oh, and he's also being investigated for HGH use allegations. Feel free to discuss over wings.\n\n6. Denver's been to a lot of Super Bowls\n\nThe Broncos are tied for the most Super Bowl appearances ever, in fact, with eight. Others that are lucky enough to have been to eight: New England Patriots (4-4), Pittsburgh Steelers (6-2), Dallas Cowboys (5-3). Eight out of fifty is a lot. But they've only won two, and lost five (so far). The two they won: back-to-back ones in 1998 and 1999, with John Elway at quarterback. John Elway, by the way, is now the general manager of the Broncos, and you'll see his face a lot during the game.\n\n7. This is Carolina's second Super Bowl\n\nCarolina only came into existence as an expansion team in 1995, but has been to two Super Bowls since then. The first was February 1, 2004, vs. the New England Patriots. They lost. It was really close. Jake Delhomme played for the Panthers. Tom Brady, of course, was the Patriots' QB.\n\n8. A big new rule change could make kicks a lot more interesting\n\nThe spot to kick extra points has been moved back this year, to the 15-yard line. What that means is that extra point after a touchdown that you used to not really think about is no longer entirely guaranteed. Ask New England. It also means a team might try to go for two points instead of one, just to see what happens.\n\n9. Players to watch that aren't Cam Newton or Peyton Manning\n\nLooking to follow folks who could change the game with a big play in a heartbeat? Keep an eye on:\n\nVon Miller, Denver: a sack machine who strips balls away from quarterbacks.Ted Ginn Jr., Carolina: a superfast receiver and punt returner.Greg Olsen, Carolina: a tight end who's Cam Newton's biggest playmaking target.C.J. Anderson, Denver: a speedy running back who could suddenly break open for a score.Luke Kuechly, Carolina: an all-star linebacker who can intercept balls and return them for TDs.Aqib Talib, Denver: a cornerback who has been known to make big interceptions.10. This is the first Bay Area Super Bowl since January 20, 1985\n\nIt's been about 30 years since Northern California had a Super Bowl celebration: Super Bowl XIX, in Palo Alto, at Stanford Stadium. The 49ers with Joe Montana won against the Miami Dolphins, 38-16. This year's Super Bowl is actually in Santa Clara, at the San Francisco 49ers' Levis Stadium, also in the heart of Silicon Valley. There's never been a Super Bowl in San Francisco proper.\n\n11. You have time to go to the bathroom at halftime\n\nIt's 30 minutes long, twice as long as the regular 15 of a normal game. And the halftime show (featuring Coldplay) doesn't run through all of it, so you have time for a break.\n\n12. No Super Bowl's ever gone to overtime\n\nSo, you can always root for that. Quick reminder on overtime rules: the first team to score wins, unless the first team to get the ball scores a field goal...then the other team gets the ball back, and can try to score. The Super Bowl can't end in a tie.\n\n(Photos by James Martin except as noted, taken of Levi's Stadium where Super Bowl 50 will be played this Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET.)\n\nTags: Super Bowl 50Tech Culture",

                    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Vernon Davis got to sleep at home for a night in the Bay Area, stay in the same hotel where he lived during 49ers training camp last summer, and the equipment staff even promised him his old locker at Levi's Stadium this weekend.\n\nNo matter that he might play a bit part in this Super Bowl for the Denver Broncos, Davis is back where he has made a home for more than a decade and ready to win a championship ring after coming up just short three years ago with San Francisco.\n\nIt just so happened he arrived Sunday for Super Bowl week on his 32nd birthday, too.\n\n\"It hasn't been that long since I left here, so it kind of seems like I was just here,\" said Davis, who was traded from the 49ers to the Broncos on Nov. 2. \"I'll look around a little bit and get a gauge on things and I'll come to the realization that I'm actually playing in the Super Bowl at Levi's Stadium.\"\n\nThe veteran tight end has had discussions with many a teammate already on the importance that they \"just stay together, just stay in this moment, and don't get caught up on the outside because the moment you do there's a lot of risk.\"\n\nDavis didn't even have plans to stop by the Jamba Juice store he owns.\n\nHe would love nothing more than to leave his mark on this Super Bowl, somehow. Even if he has played all of 11 snaps this postseason with one target and no catches.\n\n\"You haven't seen me but there's a chance that you could see me,\" he said. \"I don't know. I'm all about faith, anything could happen just like that. The moment it does, I have to take advantage of my opportunities. They will come. ... I'm a patient guy and I'm ready whenever the opportunity presents itself.\"\n\nDavis' short time in the offense -- and playing with two different quarterbacks in Peyton Manning and backup Brock Osweiler -- made for a challenging transition to his new team.\n\nAccording to Football Perspective, Davis is one of just four players to have competed in home games on the Super Bowl field during the regular season then return for the championship game with a different team.\n\nFor Davis, that three-point loss to Baltimore in the Super Bowl following the 2012 season has stuck with him -- just as it has for many of his former 49ers teammates.\n\n\"It just weighs heavy on you when you make it to the Super Bowl and you can't pull off the victory,\" Davis said. \"It's not a good feeling at all. I stressed that to some of my teammates, I wanted to make them aware of what it can feel like if things didn't go our way -- just give them that fire and that motivation.\"\n\nHe has watched Manning so intently the past couple of months to learn whatever he can from the five-time NFL MVP, noting, \"I even picked the seat beside him in the team meeting room just to get his energy.\"\n\nDavis matched his career high with 13 touchdown receptions in 2013, and believes he can still be that dominant again. He has had tough stretches before when he didn't get as many chances as he'd like.\n\nWhen someone suggested that Sunday might be his final game, Davis chuckled, \"Oh, come on, man, no way, no way.\"\n\n\"As long as I can run a 4.3 or a 4.4 I'm going to continue to play the game. When that leaves, then I'll stop playing,\" said Davis, who is still running a 4.3-second 40-yard dash. \"I'm leaving on my own terms, most definitely.\"\n\nDavis' experience in big games and athleticism is a big reason Denver acquired him.\n\n\"He's brought that,\" general manager John Elway said. \"Obviously, the play time's been up and down, but he's made some big catches for us. He came in in a short window, too, so trying to get him comfortable with the offense, what we're doing, and also it was right around the time that Brock started and came in. He's always there, he's always a threat and the defense always has to worry about him.\"\n\nDavis has been providing his share of insight already about how it felt to come so close and lose on the NFL's biggest stage. His versatility also has allowed the Broncos to run more two- and three-tight end sets.\n\n\"Vernon's a heck of a player. We came in together '06 class, so 10 years in the game for him,\" Broncos tight end Owen Daniels said. \"A ton of playoff experience, Super Bowl experience, that can't be overlooked in terms of being able to relay that to guys and kind of alert us to what might be going on during the week. He lives around the corner from here. He's great for this week specifically. He's been a great addition to our team.\"\n\n___",

                    "title": "Denver Broncos Can Pull Super Bowl 50 Upset; Top-Ranked Defense Big Reason Why",
                    "body": "When the lines opened shortly after Carolina throttled the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, Las Vegas liked the Panthers by about 3 1/2 points over the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl. Since, the line has grown to about a touchdown, and it could be up over six or seven points by the time kickoff rolls around in California on Sunday.\n\nMost prognostications and predictions are leaning toward Carolina to win the Super Bowl. And they very well may do just that. They were the best football team all season, as evidenced by their 15-1 record. They have one of, if not the best player in the world in quarterback Cam Newton. Their defense is suffocating, headlined by legitimate defensive studs like linebacker Luke Kuechly and cornerback Josh Norman.\n\nHowever, completely dismissing the Broncos' chances in Super Bowl 50. Here's a few reasons why.\n\nDenver's defense ain't bad, either\n\nIf you want to know how much potential the Denver defense has, just ask Tom Brady. The Broncos defense was fantastic in the AFC Championship Game, abusing Brady and effectively taking away the quarterback's weapons for much of the game. The NFL's fourth-ranked scoring defense also allowed the fewest yards all season. No one allowed fewer net yards per passing attempt, and no one allowed fewer net yards per rushing attempt. The Broncos' best chance to win starts with the defense replicating its effort from the New England game. Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips could be the key to this Super Bowl. He's got two weeks to come up with something to slow down Newton and the high-octane Carolina offense, and it would be surprising if Denver came into this game without another solid defensive game plan.\n\nThe Broncos' offense has shown signs of life\n\nLook, no one's going to say the Denver offense is the greatest show on turf or anything like that. Far from it. After their first drive against New England, the Broncos did a whole lot of nothing. But there's no denying that the Broncos, in theory, have some play-makers who could make a difference. On the outside, Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders make for one of the NFL's best receiver duos. The Denver running game looks rejuvenated, too. Since Nov. 22, the Broncos are averaging 108 rushing yards per game, putting up totals like 170, 179 and 210 in that stretch. They don't necessarily need numbers like that, but they do need Carolina to respect the run game. If that happens, it should open the field for Peyton Manning. The veteran obviously can't move the ball like he used to, but he's still smart enough to find the best matchup and attempt to exploit that.\n\nUnfinished business\n\nThe Broncos were in the Super Bowl just two years ago, although they probably don't want to think about that. Denver was blown out in the Meadowlands, embarrassed by the Seattle Seahawks. Here's what everyone overlooks abou that game: Denver was missing some really, really important players. The Broncos didn't have arguably its best player, Von Miller. Chris Harris, a vital piece to the Denver secondary, didn't play. Neither did Derek Wofle. All Wolfe did against New England a couple of weeks ago was record six tackles and a sack. If you don't think those guys aren't going to be fired up to make the most of a second opportunity they almost didn't even get, you're crazy. And don't discount the impact the Manning thing has on this game, either. The Broncos surely are going to do everything they can do to not only ensure they win a Super Bowl ring for themselves but also help Manning go out on top.",

                    "body": "If Las Vegas betting is any indication of the Super Bowl outcome, the Carolina Panthers should be perfecting their end zone dance. As Super Bowl week kicks off, Las Vegas wagering experts say the money is overwhelmingly coming in on the Panthers, who are currently six point favorites to win Super Bowl 50.\n\n\"This year is really rare in that nobody is betting on the Broncos. For whatever reason, we just don't seem to see any money coming in on Denver, and floods of money coming in on the Carolina Panthers,\" said Matt Holt, sports wagering expert with the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas Race and Sports Book and CG Technology.\n\nSo, how accurate is Las Vegas in predicting a winner? Through the first 49 Super Bowls, the favorites have won the big game 33 of 49 times, or 67 percent. Not a sure thing, but not bad odds either.\n\nPrior to the season's start, Denver had a high probability of being in the Super Bowl. The Panthers, on the other hand, were considered a long shot, with 60 to 1 odds of playing in football's biggest game of the year.\n\nThe Super Bowl is a familiar road in Denver (it's the team's 8th appearance), but the Panthers have played in only one other Super Bowl, losing in 2004 in the final seconds to the New England Patriots.\n\n\"Even as the season progressed and the Panthers were 5-, 6-, 7-and-0, it took longer than expected for bettors to get on board and start believing in this Panthers team,\" said Holt.\n\nToday, the Panthers aren't only the favorites, but Panthers Quarterback Cam Newton is also topping bets to be the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player.\n\nThe Super Bowl is the most gambled upon sporting event of the year. Experts predict the state of Nevada will take in between $115 million and $130 million worth of wagers. The American Gaming Association says Americans in total will bet $4.2 billion on the Super Bowl, an 8 percent increase over last year.\n\n\"Just like football, sports betting has never been more popular than it is today,\" Jeff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association.\n\nHolt said the only event that can compare to the Super Bowl in terms of the number of tickets written and number of participants would be March Madness, which is of course many college basketball games staged over many days.\n\nAs more than 114 million fans tuned in for television's biggest day of the year last year, so-called proposition or \"prop\" bets have become increasingly popular. Fans can bet on everything from the coin flip to the color of Gatorade that will be dumped on the winning coach. Experts say prop bets now make up more than half of the total dollars wagered on the game.\n\nIn terms of match-ups, Holt said this is one of the best games imaginable from a wagering standpoint.\n\n\"Outside of the New England Patriots being in the Super Bowl, and revenge (for) deflategate, I don't think we could have gotten a better Super Bowl with the Broncos and Panthers,\" he said.",

                    "title": "QR Bonus: Keys To Beating Denver",
                    "body": "Last week in this space, we looked at Carolina's worst games this season, in search of weaknesses that Denver might be able to exploit in the Super Bowl. Not it's time to turn the tables and check out the Broncos at their worst. Which teams were able to keep Denver off-balance, and expose holes in their game?\n\nIn chronological order, here are Denver's four worst games by DVOA this year:\n\nSometimes we do this exercise and have to hunt for patterns, or look for fits in three out of four games or something. This time it's much easier. In their worst four games, the Broncos' offense was a complete disaster, averaging 4.6 yards per passing play and 3.5 yards per rush. In most statistical measures, Osweiler was clearly the better passer in these four games. Still, his high sack numbers show a clear lack of pocket presence at this stage in his game, and given the ferocious nature of the Carolina pass rush, it's not quite so cut and dry that one quarterback or the other should start.\n\nWe all know Manning is starting the Super Bowl and will likely finish it as well, so there's not much point in arguing which of the two quarterbacks gives Denver its best chance to win. That doesn't mean this table can't teach us anything, though. Take note of that right-hand column. Osweiler was much more accurate than Manning, while Manning was more elusive, but neither was able to generate many big plays. The Broncos threw 34 deep passes (balls that traveled more than 15 yards past the line of scrimmage) in these four games, completing only five of them for 153 yards. Two others resulted in DPIs for 52 more yards, but that's still a horrendous average of 6.0 yards on deep throws. (The Jets averaged 9.0 yards per deep pass in 2015, the lowest figure in the league.) And if we limit that further to passes that traveled more than 25 yards downfield, then in these four games the Broncos went 0-for-10, with one DPI for 36 yards. Neither of Denver's top two wideouts made consistent plays in these four games, either. Demaryius Thomas had a 65 percent catch rate, but averaged only 9.9 yards per catch. Sanders had that 75-yarder against Cleveland, but otherwise averaged just 8.9 yards per catch, and his catch rate was a woeful 42 percent. So this was the key to shutting down the Denver passing game in 2015: taking away the home-run ball, make them drive the length of the field, and wait for them to implode.\n\nThe other thing to note about the Denver offense in these games is how one-dimensional they were. True, they were playing catchup most of the way against Kansas City, but the other three games were all back-and-forth affairs. Yet even as the passing game floundered, Denver didn't make much of an effort to run the ball. In these four bad games, they ran the ball only 32 percent of the time; in their other 12 games, that number climbed to 40 percent. This would make sense if we were talking about the Manning of 10 or five or even two years ago, but given his obvious drawbacks now, passing on two-thirds of all plays seems ludicrous. But if that's how they want to play it, the Panthers won't need to be shy about stuffing the box and daring Manning to beat them. The Broncos have shown a tendency to kill themselves with a pass-wacky attack this year.\n\nSo all of this is the bad news for the Broncos. The good news? Even in these, their worst games of the year, their defense was still lights-out dominant. In fact, their DVOA in these four games of -34.0% was actually better than their full-season DVOA of -25.8%. Their overall decline in these four games was entirely due to offense and special teams. The defense showed a remarkable ability all year to play at its best when it was needed most.\n\nA sample of the defense's amazing numbers in Denver's four worst games overall:\n\nAt their worst this year, the Broncos became an extreme version of themselves, with the best defense on earth trying desperately to win with an offense that could barely manage to stay out of its own way. Given that their Super Bowl opponents from Carolina are also strongest on defense, it's likely that the NFL's championship game will be a low-scoring contest decided by a very small number of big plays. Carolina's offense has consistently outplayed Denver's this season, so the Panthers should definitely be favored, but there's a good chance that the game will still be up for grabs into the fourth quarter. With neither team likely to put many long drives together, or get big plays in the return game, turnovers will be even more important than usual. The team that gets more short-field scoring opportunities will likely leave Santa Clara as Super Bowl champions.",

                    "body": "Guess what? A big football game is happening this Sunday. (It's being aired on CBS, CNET's parent company.)\n\nIt's the 50th Super Bowl, the final game in the NFL season that determines who wins the shiny Lombardi trophy. It's about four hours long, it has a long halftime show, and everyone you know will be talking about it on everything.\n\nLet's assume you know how football works, just a bit. Hopefully. If not, at least you can follow along with a few of these points and notes, just to catch up on what this year's game is all about. If nothing else, consider this your crib sheet between appetizers.\n\n1. It's the old \"young guy prodigy vs. fabled old guy\" game\n\nThis year's game has the greatest age gap between QBs in a Super Bowl ever...13 years. Peyton Manning, the Broncos quarterback, is 39...the oldest starting QB in Super Bowl history. Cam Newton, the Carolina Panthers' quarterback is 26. There's the span of a bar mitzvah between them. It's the Millennials vs. old guard, or whatever you want to make of it. The Super Bowl's had a lot of these matchups: Kurt Warner vs. Ben Roethlisberger. Tom Brady vs. Russell Wilson. Russell Wilson vs. Peyton Manning. And now, this. Sometimes the old vets win, sometimes the young guns do.\n\nMore Super Bowl 50 coverage CBS Sports: Complete Super Bowl 50 coverage How to watch Super Bowl 50 on nearly any device How to get your TV ready for the Super Bowl Big screens for the big game Techiest Super Bowl ever: Silicon Valley's stadium girds for the big game 2. Carolina is this year's \"surprise\" team...but they're also the favorites\n\nNo one thought the Panthers would be in the Super Bowl, but they went ahead and strung together 15 wins...while staying unbeaten until after Christmas. And they've had super-dominant performances in the playoffs: they blew the Seattle Seahawks out of the water early, and destroyed the Arizona Cardinals. Everyone thinks Carolina will win: Vegas, Madden, and plenty of pundits.\n\n3. Denver was expected, but it's their defense that's awesome\n\nDenver looked awful for a lot of this year, especially Peyton Manning. But their defense has helped them win tons of games. Their 12-4 record, and their gritty playoff wins over Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots, have been about defense. Their defense was the best in the NFL and is one of the best, statistically, of all time. So, watch for that.\n\n4. Cam Newton is the big must-see superstar personality (and show-off)\n\nIn every way, Cam Newton's this year's Super Bowl star. He's a crazily athletic quarterback. He was drafted no. 1 overall in 2011. He runs for tons of touchdowns. He's gigantic. He was the league MVP. He's known for the wildest fashion since Joe Namath and over-the-top touchdown celebrations. He also has plenty of endorsement deals, and I bet you'll see him in tons of Super Bowl commercials. Some people get annoyed by all of this. Others think it's fun. Peyton Manning, SNL appearances aside, has a pretty boring in-game personality.\n\nInside the Super Bowl tech at Levi's Stadium... 1 - 5 of 12 Next Prev 5. Peyton Manning is the old legend who's taken a beating, going for one last shot\n\nPeyton Manning is a legendary quarterback. He was the no. 1 pick in 1998. (This is the first Super Bowl between quarterbacks picked no. 1 overall in the draft, just in case you were curious.) But this season he was awful. He was pulled out midyear with an injury, and backup QB Brock Osweiler won many of Denver's key November and December games. But Manning returned for the playoffs, winning both games. Will he do just enough to win? This is Peyton Manning's fourth Super Bowl, and he's won one, lost two. Oh, and he's also being investigated for HGH use allegations. Feel free to discuss over wings.\n\n6. Denver's been to a lot of Super Bowls\n\nThe Broncos are tied for the most Super Bowl appearances ever, in fact, with eight. Others that are lucky enough to have been to eight: New England Patriots (4-4), Pittsburgh Steelers (6-2), Dallas Cowboys (5-3). Eight out of fifty is a lot. But they've only won two, and lost five (so far). The two they won: back-to-back ones in 1998 and 1999, with John Elway at quarterback. John Elway, by the way, is now the general manager of the Broncos, and you'll see his face a lot during the game.\n\n7. This is Carolina's second Super Bowl\n\nCarolina only came into existence as an expansion team in 1995, but has been to two Super Bowls since then. The first was February 1, 2004, vs. the New England Patriots. They lost. It was really close. Jake Delhomme played for the Panthers. Tom Brady, of course, was the Patriots' QB.\n\n8. A big new rule change could make kicks a lot more interesting\n\nThe spot to kick extra points has been moved back this year, to the 15-yard line. What that means is that extra point after a touchdown that you used to not really think about is no longer entirely guaranteed. Ask New England. It also means a team might try to go for two points instead of one, just to see what happens.\n\n9. Players to watch that aren't Cam Newton or Peyton Manning\n\nLooking to follow folks who could change the game with a big play in a heartbeat? Keep an eye on:\n\nVon Miller, Denver: a sack machine who strips balls away from quarterbacks.Ted Ginn Jr., Carolina: a superfast receiver and punt returner.Greg Olsen, Carolina: a tight end who's Cam Newton's biggest playmaking target.C.J. Anderson, Denver: a speedy running back who could suddenly break open for a score.Luke Kuechly, Carolina: an all-star linebacker who can intercept balls and return them for TDs.Aqib Talib, Denver: a cornerback who has been known to make big interceptions.10. This is the first Bay Area Super Bowl since January 20, 1985\n\nIt's been about 30 years since Northern California had a Super Bowl celebration: Super Bowl XIX, in Palo Alto, at Stanford Stadium. The 49ers with Joe Montana won against the Miami Dolphins, 38-16. This year's Super Bowl is actually in Santa Clara, at the San Francisco 49ers' Levis Stadium, also in the heart of Silicon Valley. There's never been a Super Bowl in San Francisco proper.\n\n11. You have time to go to the bathroom at halftime\n\nIt's 30 minutes long, twice as long as the regular 15 of a normal game. And the halftime show (featuring Coldplay) doesn't run through all of it, so you have time for a break.\n\n12. No Super Bowl's ever gone to overtime\n\nSo, you can always root for that. Quick reminder on overtime rules: the first team to score wins, unless the first team to get the ball scores a field goal...then the other team gets the ball back, and can try to score. The Super Bowl can't end in a tie.\n\n(Photos by James Martin except as noted, taken of Levi's Stadium where Super Bowl 50 will be played this Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET.)\n\nTags: Super Bowl 50Tech Culture",

There's nobody who can really simulate Newton, but the Broncos feel the extra week to prepare will help them succeed Sunday.",

It should be a fascinating game, featuring two very good defenses, and a sure Hall of Fame quarterback on one side, with one of the best young quarterbacks in the NFL on the other side.\n\nThe fact that both of those questions are focused on Denver doesn't bode well for their chances. This is the same team that got destroyed by a mobile quarterback in the Super Bowl two years ago, after all. And Newton has been a better quarterback so far than Wilson was at the time. So hey, I'm saying the Panthers win -- leaving the Atlanta Falcons as the only Super Bowl-less team in the NFC South.",

Or will Cam Newton carry Carolina and finish the Panthers' magical season with the Lombardi Trophy?\n\nThe Sheriff vs. Superman. The Orange Rush vs. the once No-Name Secondary. Von Miller vs. Cam Newton in a dance-off.\n\nWe took these questions to Madden NFL 16. We pit the NFL's top two teams to see who would win Super Bowl 50.\n\nHere is the result:\n\nDenver's defense, the identity of this Broncos squad, opened the game -- as it often does -- forcing the Panthers to a quick three-and-out. Manning looked like 2013 Peyton on the Broncos' opening possession, driving the offense 65 yards before C.J. Anderson punched in a 1-yard touchdown midway in the first quarter.\n\nNewton responded on the next drive, marching 80 yards down the field for a score -- a 7-yard strike to full back Mike Tolbert to tie the game at the end of the first.\n\nBoth defenses stepped up in the second quarter, forcing four consecutive punts and an interception by Carolina safety Kurt Coleman. The pick set up a 34-yard field goal by Graham Gano to give the Panthers a 10-7 lead late in the second.\n\nEver the field general, Manning led the Broncos 80 yards and connected with Demaryius Thomas for an 18-yard TD to give Denver a 14-10 halftime advantage.\n\nIn the second half, the Broncos picked up where they left off, rumbling 73 yards down the field. Manning again found Thomas in the end zone for a 14-yard TD, giving Denver a strong 21-10 lead.\n\nThe Panthers, out of rhythm, were forced to punt on their next possession. As Denver looked to be marching once again, Manning was sacked by Panthers lineman Charles Johnson and fumbled the ball. Carolina couldn't capitalize as the Broncos defense forced Gano to attempt a 55-yard field goal. He missed to close the third quarter.\n\nThe Broncos' next possession was a quick three-and-out, but Britton Colquitt's punt forced Carolina back to their own 3-yard line.\n\nWith the game slipping away, Newton led the Panthers 97 yards down the field and hit Jerricho Cotchery for a 9-yard TD. Then he found Dickson for the two-point conversion, cutting Denver's lead to just three.\n\nThe Broncos tried to burn the clock on their next drive, but ultimately had to punt, giving Carolina one final chance.\n\nNewton found Cotchery for a 22-yard completion on the first play of their drive. But as they have done all season long, Denver's defense came up big. First a sack by Malik Jackson, followed by a Newton incompletion. Then with time running out, DeMarcus Ware sacked Newton again to end the game and give the Broncos a 21-18 win and, more importantly, the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nManning completed 21-of-35 passes for 245 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. Thomas, named the Super Bowl MVP, had five catches for 64 yards and two TDs.\n\nNewton was 21 of 29 for 228 yards and two TDs, and ran for another 82 yards.\n\nEA Sports unveiled its annual Madden Super Bowl simulation on Monday.

The pick set up a 34-yard field goal by Graham Gano to give the Panthers a 10-7 lead late in the second.\n\nEver the field general, Manning led the Broncos 80 yards and connected with Demaryius Thomas for an 18-yard TD to give Denver a 14-10 halftime advantage.\n\nIn the second half, the Broncos picked up where they left off, rumbling 73 yards down the field. Manning again found Thomas in the end zone for a 14-yard TD, giving Denver a strong 21-10 lead.\n\nThe Panthers, out of rhythm, were forced to punt on their next possession. As Denver looked to be marching once again, Manning was sacked by Panthers lineman Charles Johnson and fumbled the ball. Carolina couldn't capitalize as the Broncos defense forced Gano to attempt a 55-yard field goal. He missed to close the third quarter.\n\nThe Broncos' next possession was a quick three-and-out, but Britton Colquitt's punt forced Carolina back to their own 3-yard line.\n\nWith the game slipping away, Newton led the Panthers 97 yards down the field and hit Jerricho Cotchery for a 9-yard TD. Then he found Dickson for the two-point conversion, cutting Denver's lead to just three.\n\nThe Broncos tried to burn the clock on their next drive, but ultimately had to punt, giving Carolina one final chance.\n\nNewton found Cotchery for a 22-yard completion on the first play of their drive. But as they have done all season long, Denver's defense came up big. First a sack by Malik Jackson, followed by a Newton incompletion. Then with time running out, DeMarcus Ware sacked Newton again to end the game and give the Broncos a 21-18 win and, more importantly, the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nManning completed 21-of-35 passes for 245 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. Thomas, named the Super Bowl MVP, had five catches for 64 yards and two TDs.\n\nNewton was 21 of 29 for 228 yards and two TDs, and ran for another 82 yards.\n\nEA Sports unveiled its annual Madden Super Bowl simulation on Monday.

                    "body": "Super Bowl betting action is nearly as much of a story as the game itself.\n\nWith two weeks between the conference championship games and Super Bowl 50, the changing point spread has a chance to take casual bettors and wise guys on a journey as they look for the right opportunity to bet their hard-earned money (ahem) on the game.\n\nThe early action was primarily on the Carolina Panthers, who once again sit as six-point favorites in the game over the Denver Broncos, according to OddsShark. The Super Bowl line was set at 3.5 points within minutes of the Panthers' victory over the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game. It went up quickly after that, and reached six points by the middle of last week.\n\nThe line was knocked down to 5.5 points briefly, but many of the sportsbooks in Las Vegas brought the line back up to six points.\n\nThe majority of the money and individual bets that have been made have come in on the Broncos. With five days to go before Super Bowl 50, 58 percent of the bets have been on the Panthers, according to OddsShark.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 Odds Game Point Spread Over/Under Moneyline Fractional Odds Denver Broncos vs. Carolina Panthers Car. (-6) 45 Denver +127; Carolina -197 127-100; 100-197\n\nOdds Shark\n\nHowever, even though it seems the public is backing the Panthers heavily to this point, there is plenty of Denver money out there, according to VegasInsider reporter Micah Roberts' interview with Wynn sportsbook director John Avello.\n\nAvello said that as much as 80 percent of the money that comes in on the Super Bowl is bet on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nA good percentage of that money could come from Denver bettors who are hoping the point spread reaches 6.5 points or higher. The line may not reach that point, but Denver backers are apparently willing to wait.\n\nThe moneyline has also favored the Panthers, as Carolina is minus-197 to win the game straight-up, while the Broncos are plus-172. A Carolina bettor would have to risk $197 to win $100 while a Denver backer will risk $100 to win $172.\n\nThe over/under betting has been quite steady to this point. The total is sitting at 45 points and has remained at that level even though 60 percent of the money wagered has been on the over.\n\nKevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhile some handicappers are expecting an influx of cash on the Broncos, it seems unlikely that the proportions of the betting will change dramatically.\n\nThe Panthers have simply been too strong and dependable all season, and they are the more explosive offensive team by a wide margin.\n\nQuarterback Cam Newton will likely be awarded the NFL's MVP on Saturday night because he was the league's most impactful player this season with 35 touchdown passes and 10 touchdown runs. More than the numbers, Newton came through with clutch plays all season and his ability to lead his team is unquestioned at this point.\n\nPeyton Manning appears ready to head off into the sunset of retirement after this game. While nothing is official, Manning mouthed those words to New England head coach Bill Belichick when the two met at midfield following the Broncos' victory over the Patriots in the AFC title game.\n\nManning's performance has fallen dramatically, throwing just nine TD passes and 19 interceptions during the regular season. In addition to his falling stats, Manning's ability to throw the mid-range and deep pass has clearly taken a hit because his passes lack velocity and tend to wobble.\n\nThe Broncos' strengths at this point are their top-ranked defense and Manning's ability to read defenses and manage the game.\n\nDenver backers are hoping that will be enough to move the line another half-point or more before Sunday's kickoff at 6:30 p.m. ET at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.",

And once that happens, it's going to get ugly.\n\nGiven the unavoidable avalanche of hype and all the time between the conference championship games and the one that comes next at the end of every NFL season, the temptation to over-think the Super Bowl is sometimes difficult to resist.\n\nNot this time.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for Denver to score points,\" ESPN analyst and former Steelers running back Merril Hoge maintained during a recent appearance on the DVE Morning Show. \"It's going to be really, really hard for (the Broncos) to score points.\"\n\nAnd there you have it.\n\nDenver has the NFL's No. 1 defense, and the NFL's No. 1 defense in terms of yards allowed per game has traditionally done very well in this game (11-4).\n\nBut the problem for the Broncos is Peyton Manning has hung around for at least one rodeo too many. And against a Carolina defense that's no slouch in its own right that's not something the Broncos are going to be able to work around.\n\nCarolina is going to score, even against that No. 1 Broncos defense, because that's what Carolina does.\n\nThe Panthers have a running game and Cam Newton and an attacking, first-down-or-touchdown approach in the passing game that gets results sooner or later.\n\n\"That Cardinals defense is one of the best in football and they shredded them,\" Hoge said of the Panthers' 49-15 victory over Arizona in the NFC Championship Game. \"They absolutely shredded them.\"\n\nThe Broncos won their way to Super Bowl 50, as well, but they did so much more by surviving the Steelers and then the Patriots than by shredding them.\n\nShredding anyone is no longer within Manning's grasp.\n\nThe Broncos have to win by playing great defense and by Manning finding a way to manage the game, something he still does exceptionally well.\n\nBut eventually, Manning is going to have to stand and deliver this time.\n\nThe Panthers have averaged 36.1 points and 385.3 yards over their last nine games, so they're going to get to the Broncos eventually.\n\nWhen that happens, Manning is going to be forced to throw it.\n\nAnd once that happens, it's going to get ugly.\n\nMaybe the Panthers jump the Broncos early.\n\nMaybe they outlast the Broncos and gradually pull away late.\n\nBut either way it doesn't figure to be close.\n\n\"To me this is a no-brainer,\" Hoge concluded. \"Aside from throwing in injuries - that means Cam Newton goes down early and they have three turnovers - I just don't see it.\"\n\n\"No-brainer\" is often a risky description at best when applied to an NFL game, let alone a championship game.\n\nNot this time.\n\n\"If they're at their best and we're at our best, we're going to win,\" Newton has told anyone willing to listen this week.\n\nAs to what might happen if the Panthers are at their best and the Broncos are at something less, Seattle 43, Denver 8 in Super Bowl XLVIII comes to mind as an eventual outcome under such circumstances.\n\nMake it Panthers 38, Broncos 16 this time.",

                    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The overriding theme for both the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers at Super Bowl 50's opening night event was \"Hey, we're all just here to have fun.\"\n\nThe tone of the evening, of course, lends itself to that as the NFL media takes a step back to allow the entertainment media to step forward and ask all their lifestyle and off-beat questions, with the understanding the football talk will come at the news conferences at the team hotels Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nParticularly at ease as the Broncos kicked off the show was Peyton Manning, looking much like a man determined to enjoy his \"last rodeo.\"\n\nManning came across as more the TV commercial pitch man than Hall of Fame quarterback as questions came from all corners, but it was his answer to a football question that raised more than a few ears and eyebrows.\n\nAsked how strong his arm would be for the game Sunday, Manning said, \"Honestly, my arm hasn't been the same since I had the neck injury four years ago. I did some permanent damage, and I've worked really hard to get to the point where I can kind of just manage it, but my arm isn't the same.\"\n\nHaving covered Manning's four Super Bowl appearances, his frank reply was a surprise.\n\nDeMarcus Ware and Von Miller were at podiums next to each other and as animated as any Broncos at the show.\n\nWare enjoyed telling the media about his favorite cartoon characters and what it meant to him to be at the Super Bowl at this stage of his career. Miller was animated and bubbly but also surprisingly deferential to Ware.\n\nAt one point, Miller credited Ware for much of his success this season, saying, \"It's just an unbelievable blessing to play with someone like DeMarcus. He's seen every move and every trick a blocker has and he's always teaching the rest of us how to be better.\"\n\nIf either side had an edge in cockiness or bluster, it was the Panthers.\n\nCam Newton showed up in a Super Bowl towel molded into a dew rag on his head and Josh Norman in a full mask that resembled a Batman mask in Panthers blue, including the team logo.\n\nNorman avoided serious answers to any questions for the first 15 minutes or so, trying to sound more like a super hero than a football player before he finally removed the mask and began to act more normal.\n\nNewton is an extremely impressive young man with a massive smile who easily commands a crowd and seemed to be on a mission to hit all the right notes.\n\nAsked what he hoped to enjoy the most this week about the Bay Area and the Super Bowl, he talked about what a privilege it is to be in the Super Bowl, how it's going to be a business trip for him and his only goal is to win a championship.\n\nThis is the second Super Bowl for Charles \"Peanut\" Tillman, and when asked how disappointed he is to not play because of his torn ACL he said, \"Hey, my injury is what it is. I'm here to do whatever it is to help my teammates win rings.\n\n\"I'll coach 'em up on the sidelines, fetch 'em water and towels, whatever I can do to help my team win.\"\n\nThere was one revelation for me at opening night. In spite of everything we've heard, I would have bet dollars to doughnuts Thomas Davis would not be able to go Sunday with his surgically repaired arm.\n\nBut listening to Davis talk about his commitment to playing and how he has been experimenting with the trainers and doctors on how to protect the arm, I came away convinced he will play Sunday.\n\nIt was clear both teams had a lot of fun, something that doesn't always happen enough for players and coaches at the Super Bowl.\n\n*\u2009For more from Chicago Football editor Hub Arkush, visit chicagofootball.com.

                    "body": "Guess what? A big football game is happening this Sunday. (It's being aired on CBS, CNET's parent company.)\n\nIt's the 50th Super Bowl, the final game in the NFL season that determines who wins the shiny Lombardi trophy. It's about four hours long, it has a long halftime show, and everyone you know will be talking about it on everything.\n\nLet's assume you know how football works, just a bit. Hopefully. If not, at least you can follow along with a few of these points and notes, just to catch up on what this year's game is all about. If nothing else, consider this your crib sheet between appetizers.\n\n1. It's the old \"young guy prodigy vs. fabled old guy\" game\n\nThis year's game has the greatest age gap between QBs in a Super Bowl ever...13 years. Peyton Manning, the Broncos quarterback, is 39...the oldest starting QB in Super Bowl history. Cam Newton, the Carolina Panthers' quarterback is 26. There's the span of a bar mitzvah between them. It's the Millennials vs. old guard, or whatever you want to make of it. The Super Bowl's had a lot of these matchups: Kurt Warner vs Ben Roethlisberger. Tom Brady vs Russell Wilson. Russell Wilson vs Peyton Manning. And now, this. Sometimes the old vets win, sometimes the young guns do.\n\nMore Super Bowl 50 coverage CBS Sports: Complete Super Bowl 50 coverage How to watch Super Bowl 50 on nearly any device How to get your TV ready for the Super Bowl Big screens for the big game Techiest Super Bowl ever: Silicon Valley's stadium girds for the big game 2. Carolina is this year's \"surprise\" team...but they're also the favorites\n\nNo one thought the Panthers would be in the Super Bowl, but they went ahead and strung together 15 wins...while staying unbeaten until after Christmas. And they've had super-dominant performances in the playoffs: they blew the Seattle Seahawks out of the water early, and destroyed the Arizona Cardinals. Everyone thinks Carolina will win: Vegas, Madden, and plenty of pundits.\n\n3. Denver was expected, but it's their defense that's awesome\n\nDenver looked awful for a lot of this year, especially Peyton Manning. But the defense has helped them win tons of games. Their 12-4 record, and their gritty playoff wins over Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots, have been about defense. Their defense was the best in the NFL, and is one of the best, statistically, of all time. So, watch for that.\n\n4. Cam Newton's the big must-see superstar personality (and show-off)\n\nIn every way, Cam Newton's this year's Super Bowl star. He's a crazily athletic quarterback. He was drafted #1 overall in 2011. He runs for tons of touchdowns. He's gigantic. He was the league MVP. He's known for the wildest fashion since Joe Namath and over-the-top touchdown celebrations. He also has plenty of endorsement deals, and I bet you'll see him in tons of Super Bowl commercials. Some people get annoyed by all of this. Others think it's fun. Peyton Manning, SNL appearances aside, has a pretty boring in-game personality.\n\nInside the Super Bowl tech at Levi's Stadium... 1 - 5 of 12 Next Prev 5. Peyton Manning's the old legend who's taken a beating, going for one last shot\n\nPeyton Manning is a legendary quarterback. He was the #1 pick in 1998. (This is the first Super Bowl between quarterbacks picked #1 overall in the draft, just in case you were curious.) But this season he was awful. He was pulled out mid-year with an injury, and backup QB Brock Osweiler won many of Denver's key November and December games. But Manning returned for the playoffs, winning both games. Will he do just enough to win? This is Peyton Manning's fourth Super Bowl, and he's won one, lost two. Oh, and he's also being investigated for HGH use allegations. Feel free to discuss over wings.\n\n6. Denver's been to a lot of Super Bowls\n\nDenver's tied for the most Super Bowl appearances ever, in fact. Others that are lucky enough to have been to 8: New England Patriots (4-4), Pittsburgh Steelers (6-2), Dallas Cowboys (5-3). Eight out of fifty is a lot. But they've only won 2, and lost 5 (so far). The two they won: back-to-back ones in 1998 and 1999, with John Elway at quarterback. John Elway, by the way, is now the general manager of the Broncos, and you'll see his face a lot during the game.\n\n7. This is Carolina's second Super Bowl\n\nCarolina only came into existence as an expansion team in 1995, but has been to two Super Bowls since then. The first was February 1, 2004, vs the New England Patriots. They lost. It was really close. Jake Delhomme played for the Panthers. Tom Brady, of course, played for the Patriots.\n\n8. A big new rule change could make kicks a lot more interesting\n\nThe spot to kick extra points has been moved back this year, to the 15 yard line. What that means is that extra point after a touchdown that you used to not really think about is no longer entirely guaranteed. Ask New England. It also means a team might try to go for two points instead of one, just to see what happens.\n\n9. Players to watch that aren't Cam Newton or Peyton Manning\n\nLooking to follow folks who could change the game with a big play in a heartbeat? Keep an eye on:\n\nVon Miller, Denver: a sack machine who strips balls away from quarterbacks.Ted Ginn Jr., Carolina: super-fast receiver and punt returner.Greg Olsen, Carolina: a tight end who's Cam Newton's biggest playmaking target.C.J. Anderson, Denver: a speedy running back who could suddenly break open for a score.Luke Kuechly, Carolina: all-star linebacker who can intercept balls and return them for TDs.Aqib Talib, Denver: a cornerback who has been known to make big interceptions.10. This is the first Bay Area Super Bowl since January 20, 1985\n\nIt's been about 30 years since Northern California had a Super Bowl celebration: Super Bowl XIX, in Palo Alto, at Stanford Stadium. The 49ers won with Joe Montana against the Miami Dolphins, 38-16. This year's Super Bowl is actually in Santa Clara, at the San Francisco 49ers' Levis Stadium, also in the heart of Silicon Valley. There's never been a Super Bowl in San Francisco proper.\n\n11. You have time to go to the bathroom at halftime\n\nIt's 30 minutes, twice as long as the regular 15 in a normal game. And the halftime show (featuring Coldplay) doesn't run through all of it, so you have time for a break.\n\n12. No Super Bowl's ever gone to overtime\n\nSo, you can always root for that. Quick reminder on overtime rules: the first team to score wins, unless the first team to get the ball scores a field goal...then the other team gets the ball back, and can try to score. The Super Bowl can't end in a tie.\n\n(photos by James Martin, taken of Levi's Stadium where Super Bowl 50 will be played this Sunday at 6:30pm ET.)\n\nTags: Tech Culture",

                    "body": "Super bowl week is now fully underway and the anticipation is becoming unbearable. Since the Broncos and Panthers play only once every four years, and Carolina playing on the east coast, I along with many Bronco fans are relatively unfamiliar with the Panthers. They haven't been on national TV a whole lot so out here in Denver we don't see many of their games (though we started at the end of the year). I want to have some intelligent conversation about the game with perspectives from both sides and I'm hoping to learn more about Carolina. Hopefully people will discuss facts and not stuff like the broncos will win because they have a special \"look in their eye\" and \"cam celebrates too much\". Who cares about that stuff, I want to talk about football.\n\nOffensively the Broncos are a bit stale. The offensive line has been up and down (much more down) and the running game has finally started to do better. Peyton has not been able to throw deep all year even though there has been open receivers. The Broncos have great talent at receiver with Thomas and Sanders. DT has struggled in the playoffs and needs to play better this game. The big difference between Peyton at the beginning of the year and the end of the year is turnovers. Peyton started off with 9 tds to 17 interceptions but did not have an interception in the first two playoff games (just a backwards pass that Hillman didn't pick up). Carolina's defensive strength is taking the ball away so the Broncos must not turn the ball over to be successful in this game.\n\nDefensively the Broncos are for real. Wade Phillips coached this defense to be the best in the league. They only allowed more than 30 points once, against the Steelers, and have had a furious pass rush. They had 52 sacks on the year with the sacks coming from many players. Von Miller, Ware, Malik Jackson, Derek Wolfe, and Shaquill Barret at least 5 sacks this year with Shane Ray also having 4. Malik Jackson and Derek Wolfe are largely unknown players but they have taken over games with their run stopping and pass rush. The Broncos also have two very fast middle linebackers in Trevathan and Marshall. They both had over 100 tackles this year. The secondary is very good with Harris and Talib being able to line up one on one with Roby covering the third receiver. Ward and Stewart have both been very good this year but were injured against the Pats. They have both said they will play and I think them being healthy is a key to this game.\n\nFor the Broncos to win they have to stop the run which is definitely a tall task because Carolina is so good in that area. Has anyone been successful in that area against you guys this year? I think the Broncos will be able to get pressure on Cam but if they can't stop the run that will be tough. How do you guys think your offense matches up against the Broncos defense? If you guys have any questions hopefully some of us can answer them.\n\nThe closer the game the more it favors Denver as they've won 11 games by 7 points or less this year. Here's to a fun week of debate and intelligent conversation and a great game.",

                    "title": "5 things most likely to cost the Panthers the Super Bowl",
                    "body": "Even Cam Newton can have a bad game -- it just hasn't happened very often in recent weeks.\n\nThe Panthers lost only once this season, in Week 16 to the Falcons, so it's pretty tough to figure out what could undermine them with everything on the line Sunday in the Super Bowl. But every team can be undone, and Carolina is no different. Here are five things that could trip up the Panthers against the Broncos.\n\nIt seems silly to say it given that Newton is about to win the league MVP award, but he's not that far removed from a rather ordinary start to the season, when his QB rating was lower than 80 in five of the Panthers' first seven games. Those were the days when everyone thought Carolina's fast start was a fluke - largely because the Panthers seemed to let even bad opponents hang around. It wasn't until Newton started topping 100 in QB rating regularly - as he did in nine of his last 11 games, including the playoffs - that Carolina began blowing out opponents and convincing folks they were the real deal. When Newton did struggle in one late-season game - 17 of 30 for 142 yards - Atlanta pulled off the Week 16 upset. Denver's top-ranked defense has a way of making quarterbacks look bad, so it's at least worth considering that Newton might come back to earth in this game.\n\n2. Acting like they haven't been there before\n\nThe Broncos were in the Super Bowl just two years ago, so this isn't a new thing for most of them - particularly not their quarterback. This group of Panthers, however, had made it only as far as the Divisional Round of the playoffs the past two seasons. Carolina managed to weather the pressure that went with a 14-0 start just fine, so it's unlikely Ron Rivera will let his team get distracted, but the reason so many Super Bowls have been blowouts is because of a focus gap, not a talent gap. The Panthers have to make sure they are not on the wrong side of that equation.\n\n3. Not being aggressive enough against Peyton Manning\n\nNo one expected the 39-year-old Manning to make it this far after he returned from an injury-driven benching with just two quarters left in the regular season. He's not nearly what he once was, but somehow the Patriots and the Steelers before them couldn't force the five-time NFL MVP into a mistake. Given Manning's limitations in both arm strength and mobility, there simply are plays he can no longer make. The Panthers ranked sixth in the league in sacks and led the league in interceptions. They will be making a mistake if they don't draw up a highly aggressive game plan that forces Manning into the turnovers he made all season before returning from that injury. This is no time to show undue respect to a future Hall of Famer.\n\nIs it worse if Davis plays with a recently fractured arm that has about a dozen screws in it or takes the day off? The Panthers' veteran linebacker insists he'll play Sunday, but it's hard to imagine that trying to make tackles with one healthy arm won't slow down the heart and soul of the defense that is Davis and fellow linebacker Luke Kuechly. Davis' spirit is exactly what you'd expect from a player who earned his first Pro Bowl selection at age 32, but he'll need to be careful that he's not hurting more than he's helping.\n\nPanthers offensive tackles Michael Oher and Mike Remmers are solid but not spectacular, and spectacular might be what's needed against a Broncos defense that hit New England's Tom Brady an amazing 23 times in the AFC championship game. Granted, Newton can burn Denver if the Broncos get too aggressive on the edge and don't stop him from escaping up the middle, but that doesn't mean the Panthers' tackles can let the floodgates open. This will be a tough matchup for Carolina, and letting it get lopsided could leave the Panthers with the same result the Patriots got.",

                    "body": "The public loves the Carolina Panthers to win and cover the spread as solid betting favourites at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 so far, and with good reason. All the Panthers need to do is keep doing what got them to this point.\n\nThat may seem like an obvious observation, but Carolina is on the brink of becoming only the third Super Bowl champion to finish the season at 18-1. The Panthers have gone 13-5 against the spread through their first 18 games and dominated the first halves of each of their first two playoff games.\n\nAnother good start will not only put them in prime position to win their first NFL title but also get the cover no matter how high the spread goes.\n\nBehind quarterback Cam Newton, Carolina is the most dangerous team in the league both running and passing the ball. Newton accounted for an NFL-best 45 touchdowns (35 passing and 10 rushing) during the regular season and helped the team overcome the loss of running back Jonathan Stewart for three games due to a foot injury.\n\nStewart's return in the post-season has made the team even more dangerous, as he carried the ball 19 times in each game and averaged nearly 95 yards with two scores.\n\nDefensively, the Panthers are also a force to be reckoned with, and nobody personifies their character and determination more than linebacker Thomas Davis. Despite breaking his arm in a 49-15 rout of the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, Davis had surgery the next day so he could play in Super Bowl 50.\n\nDavis and fellow linebacker Luke Kuechly should help limit Denver's running game and also keep tight ends Owen Daniels and Vernon Davis from hurting them through the air.\n\nCarolina wants to make Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning try to win the game too after he threw 17 interceptions in nine starts before the playoffs. Manning has thrown multiple picks five times this season, something you can bet cornerback Josh Norman and the rest of the Panthers will look to capitalize on.\n\nThey forced Arizona quarterback Carson Palmer into six turnovers (four interceptions and two fumbles) in the NFC title game, and their ability to pressure Manning into similar mistakes could be the difference between whether or not they cover the Super Bowl betting line on Sunday.",

                    "body": "Ranking every Super Bowl that's ever been played in NFL history\n\nSuper Bowl 50 is upon us, with Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers out of the NFC set to take on a legend in Peyton Manning and his Denver Broncos representing the AFC. Between the star quarterbacks and arguably the two best defenses in the league ready to make their mark on at Levi's Stadium, this game has all the makings of a classic.\n\nWhat's most interesting is that there is a ton of history on the line. Can Manning capture one more Super Bowl victory, evening his record in the sport's biggest game? Will Newton put the first ring on his resume? Is this clash between two prolific defenses going to result in a riveting matchup or a snooze fest?\n\nThere's the potential for this game to be something special, considering what both the Panthers and the Broncos have shown that they're capable of throughout the 2015 season. The question that will eventually be asked is where Super Bowl 50 ranks among the rest of the Super Bowls in league history.\n\nThough this year's big game has yet to commence, we can look at the history of the Super Bowl and all the games that have led us to what is hopefully a classic in the 50th anniversary of the title game. Ranked from worst-to-first, these are how the first 49 Super Bowls stack up against one another.",

He talked to the Panthers about the incident before the team left Charlotte for San Francisco.\n\n\"That's the first time I heard that story. I didn't know anything about it,\" tight end Ed Dickson said, via Joseph Person of the Charlotte Observer. \"It says a lot that he would open up and say something about it. Because a lot of people would hold it in and not even talk about that moment. . . . Him being an ex-player, him being in that moment, he wanted to make sure nobody else would be that guy again. That's huge.\"\n\nRobinson declined to comment on the speech that he gave to the players, but it was smart for the Panthers to take advantage of the fact that they have a compelling in-house reminder of the pitfalls that can arise during Super Bowl week.",

                    "body": "The hype surrounding the Carolina Panthers and their participation in Super Bowl 50 is far and wide in this state.\n\nBut what about the Broncos fans in the area? Well it just so happens they're optimistic about their teams chances as well.\n\nTake Fred Emerson, for example. Emerson and his family moved to Denver in 1960, the same year the Broncos competed in their first professional football game - a 13-10 victory over the Boston Patriots in the American Football League.\n\nWith the longevity of his lore for the Broncos, Emerson is hopeful this year's team emerges on top, even though that's not necessarily a popular opinion locally.\n\n\"Given the Broncos have been winning close games all year, I think Denver will win if they can contain Cam Newton,\" Emerson said. \"If they can do what they did to Tom Brady, they can win. If they don't, I think Carolina will squeak out a close one. Carolina has a good defense. I don't think it's as good as Denver's, but it's still very good. I think it will be a good game.\"\n\nEmerson isn't alone in his displaced Broncos fandom. Alicia Chapman and her 10-year-old son, Kyle, are pulling for Peyton Manning and Denver in the championship game.\n\nNatives of western North Carolina, the Chapmans consider themselves more Peyton Manning fans than Broncos fans, as they favor the University of Tennessee for college football. That being said, don't question the youngest Chapman's dedication to the game.\n\n\"When you're from there, a lot of people pull for the University of Tennessee,\" Alicia Chapman said. \"(Kyle) developed as a fan for Peyton from being a UT fan. He can tell you anything about Peyton. He knows his states, has watched his videos, and knows his draft. He can tell you almost anything about any of the Mannings, but Peyton is his favorite.\"\n\nAsked for a prediction, the Chapmans weren't about to let the locals influence their desired outcome for the big game.\n\n\"I feel like the Panthers are strong, but I feel like this is going to be the year for Peyton,\" Alicia Chapman said. \"I would like to see Denver win for Peyton, because he's close to retirement.\"\n\nRetirement is something Joe Salemi can relate to. He and his wife relocated to the Leland area less than a year ago, after retiring from work in the Denver area.\n\nWhile they are still rooting for the Broncos on Sunday, they were sure to note how different the hospitality of a rival team is in an opponent's home.\n\n\"Panthers fans wouldn't be treated near as nice as we are here,\" Salemi said.\" We're not sorry that we don't miss all of that. It'd be nice to see some stuff, and we've been able to find some decorations, but it's been fine. When we've been around in our Broncos shirts and stuff, people have been very friendly and gracious. We haven't had anybody make a bad comment.\"\n\nWhether it'll be the Mile High Salute or the Dab to end Super Bowl 50 remains to be seen, but Denver fans in North Carolina are hopeful for a competitive contest to cap the NFL season.\n\n\"Certainly I'd like to see the Broncos win, but I root for the Panthers when they aren't playing the Broncos. I just hope that it's a good game.\"",

But the team hasn't lost sight of its ultimate goal.\n\nThe Broncos wideout told NESN's Ashley Allen at Super Bowl 50 Opening Night on Monday that \"it's a little different\" to have Peyton Manning back under center after he missed Weeks 11 through 16 with shoulder and foot injuries. But Thomas said that was less important than what happened when backup Brock Osweiler took over.\n\n\"We kept winning,\" Thomas told Allen. \"Brock came in as a big leader, ... stepped up big, and we haven't paid him back. It's our time.\"\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean Thomas doesn't want to beat the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 for Manning, too. The 28-year-old said having a relationship with any quarterback is important, and the Broncos are particularly close.\n\n\"All of our relationships are very close,\" Thomas said. \"We talk, we hang out, we have offensive bonding days, which help us out, as well. It's big, especially to have a bond with a receiver because if you're on the same page as the quarterback, most of the time you have a good day.\"\n\nAnd as for Manning's health, Thomas isn't worried at all. The 39-year-old quarterback might be on his way out of the NFL, but he's performed significantly better since getting six weeks of rest.\n\nThomas doesn't think there should be any concern about him going into Sunday's game.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Thomas said. \"I think he'll be fine. If you thought he'd get re-injured, he'd for sure not play a lot. We'd let Brock in for this big of a game. He wouldn't go out and try to hurt the team because he's injured and tried to play through it. He'll be fine.\"",

                    "title": "CJ Anderson, Ronnie Hillman can bring another title to Broncos",
                    "body": "As the Denver Broncos prepare to play in Super Bowl 50, I find myself reflecting on my own preparation for the big game 18 years ago, when I was getting ready to represent the Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII. There was a lot to prepare for, but the most important thing was, I had to have a good performance as the leader of Denver's ground game.\n\nCurrent Denver running backs C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman must feel the same way, as this year's Broncos have had the most success when leaning on the run -- consider that they're 9-0 when rushing for 105-plus yards this season (including in the playoffs). I was fortunate to experience two Super Bowl victories -- in Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII -- with my dedicated approach. Here is my advice to Anderson and Hillman as they attempt to bring yet another championship to Denver:\n\nIt's extremely hard to treat the Super Bowl like a normal game, but you have to try. For me and many others, the best way to do this is to approach all games -- in the preseason, the regular season and the playoffs -- with the same intensity, giving your best effort when you take the field. That mindset allowed me to slow things down, be comfortable and stay in the moment.\n\nThere were times when I was reminded of how big this game actually was; my heart would pound and I'd feel as if I had to change my game plan to achieve bigger gains. But knowing that I'd played football since I was a little kid, and that this game was so familiar to me, helped me zero in on my job and allowed me to play better in big moments.\n\nIn the week leading up to my first Super Bowl appearance, I put it upon myself to win the game. I visualized being announced the game's MVP and the plays I was going to make to get there. After all, if I played well enough to win that award, it meant our team would win. If I didn't play well, we probably wouldn't. It was that simple. There are players who don't want that responsibility, because it is a huge burden to put on yourself. But I embraced it, and my visualization turned into a reality -- I was named MVP of Super Bowl XXXII after running for 157 yards and three scores.\n\nAtlanta had the NFL's second-best run defense heading into Super Bowl XXXIII, and it was no secret that ours was a run-first offense. I realized teams were going to attempt to make me a non-factor, but I couldn't change my approach just because a monster defense was on the other side. My job was to try to dominate and be special when I had the ball. Even if I struggled on some plays, I had to stay consistent, because it would eventually pay off and our pass game would open up for John Elway and the rest of our offense.\n\nMy pregame routine was to take migraine medication about two hours prior to kickoff. But because I was so excited to play in my first Super Bowl, I forgot to take it before XXXII. In the first quarter against the Packers, I took a hard hit and immediately got a migraine. I had to leave the game for a period of time in the second quarter. I hated it, and I felt like I'd let my teammates down. In my visualization routine, I didn't factor in leaving the game. I got back to the field as soon as I could after halftime, though I didn't feel well for the remainder of the contest.\n\nStill, I had to welcome the challenge, because I couldn't wait for the next day -- not when the season was a few hours away from ending. I had to push through the pain and stick to my initial goal of playing well enough to win the game. Whether or not I was feeling good, I believed I could do it, and that belief boosted my play.\n\nIt goes without saying that you want to win for yourself, but there was this extra motivation to send John -- who went 0-3 in Super Bowl appearances in his first 14 seasons -- out the right way. He is someone I respect, care about and genuinely love, and he deserved to end his career on top. It's easier to let yourself down, but when you let a teammate down, it feels much worse. It was important for me to help him win because I knew what he'd gone through -- losing three previous Super Bowls -- and we, at the time, had the best team he'd probably ever been on. We had a great opportunity, and it was definitely in the back of our minds. I'm sure something similar could be said of this year's Denver team, which is angling to give Peyton Manning his second Super Bowl win in his 18th season. That was a major motivator to win. Fortunately, we helped John capture back-to-back rings in his final two seasons.\n\nI believe these five key factors helped the Denver Broncos achieve back-to-back championships in the '90s. Anderson and Hillman have what it takes to be successful in this game. They just have to channel their preparation and believe in it.",

Yesterday, though, was appointment viewing.\n\nEach of the Super Bowls' most-noticable players -- Peyton Manning, Von Miller, Cam Newton, etc. -- were introduced individually, walking out onto a bridge that overlooked the field at the SAP Center.\n\nAnd it's clear the players knew this was a little different than in year's past; they came out in style ...\n\nNow, as is the case every year, there are some good questions and there are some dumb questions. Likewise, some players give us intelligent, well-thought-out answers, while others are \"about that action, boss.\"\n\nBut, by far, the most important thing Broncos country learned on Super Bowl Opening night is that Gary Kubiak, the head coach of the Denver Broncos, does not have stadium access to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Denver Broncos arrive in San Jose for Super Bowl 50\n\nWhile Denver deals with a blizzard, the Broncos landed in sunny California with style.\n\nDonald Trump gives his support to Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos\n\nDonald Trump may not have had a good night on Monday, but at least he made sure to back the good guys in Super Bowl 50. But has Broncos Country left enough room on the bandwagon for Mr. Trump?\n\nPeyton Manning buys his favorite wide receiver a new suit\n\nNot many people may know the name of practice squad wideout Jordan \"Sunshine\" Taylor, but Peyton Manning most certainly does, and he proved it over the weekend.\n\nDenver Broncos' team bus involved in accident\n\nWell, it can only go up from here, right? The Denver Broncos team bus was in a minor accident following their first practice in Santa Clara. Luckily, nobody was injured.\n\nThree Denver Broncos you need to keep your eye on during Super Bowl week\n\nAs we settle in for all the Super Bowl festivities, here are three Denver Broncos you need to keep your eyes on.\n\nBroncos fans will help determine the Super Bowl\n\nBroncos fans have been the X-factor in stopping great offenses all year. They have one more task to help their team win a Super Bowl.\n\nPeyton Manning rocks the bling on the way out to Super Bowl 50\n\nMuch like Wade Phillips on Super Bowl Opening Night, Peyton Manning looked to up his swag with some ice around his neck.",

The Broncos will once again try to prove the prognosticators wrong with another upset win when they take on the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50.\n\nDenver is a 5.5-point betting underdog for Super Bowl Sunday according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com. In their last 11 games coming off an upset win, the Denver Broncos are 9-2 SU.\n\nThe popular breakdown for this game suggests that both the Broncos and the Panthers have excellent defenses, but only the Panthers have an excellent offense. If this sounds familiar, it should, because it was the same argument used against the Broncos when they took on the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.\n\nNew England certainly didn't look like a top-three scoring offense against this defense, scoring only 18 points and turning the ball over twice.\n\nThe Broncos' attack on Tom Brady was relentless. The league's third leading passer was pressured 19 times and sacked four times, forced into two interceptions and a completion percentage under 50 percent. Regardless of how good a quarterback is with time, facing pressure like Denver can deal out will almost always force a bad performance.\n\nAnd even if Cam Newton is able to elude some of this pressure, the Broncos will have a game plan to keep the quarterback contained.\n\nOffensively, the Broncos aren't as bad as they get criticized for. Early season struggles in the rushing game skew the numbers, but over Denver's last eight games, the team has rushed for 122.8 yards per game.\n\nPeyton Manning is healthier now than he was in the first half of the season, and it has shown this postseason with 398 passing yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions against two strong defenses.\n\nLastly, Super Bowl history shows that the betting action is usually on the wrong side. The underdog is 4-0 SU and ATS over the last four Super Bowls and 11-3-1 ATS over the last 15.\n\nDenver's defense is good enough to at least keep this game within 5.5 points, but could also wind up leading the team to an outright upset as well.",

                    "body": "Mom's journey from jail to Super Bowl delights Broncos star\n\nBy Afp\n\nPublished: 14:36 GMT, 2 February 2016 | Updated: 14:36 GMT, 2 February 2016\n\nWhen Katina Stuckey Smith settles into her seat at the billion-dollar Levi's Stadium to watch her son Demaryius Thomas play for the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 on Sunday she will be making up for lost time.\n\nTwo years ago, when Thomas scored a touchdown for the Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII despite playing almost the entire game with a separated shoulder, his mother was languishing in a federal prison cell in Florida.\n\nSmith, 42, has missed almost the entirety of her son's football career. In 1999 she was jailed with Thomas's grandmother for running a crack-cocaine operation from the family home and sentenced to 24 years in prison.\n\nDemaryius Thomas of the Denver Broncos addresses the media on February 1, 2016 in San Jose, California \u00a9Thearon W. Henderson (Getty/AFP)\n\nShe rejected a plea deal which would have seen her given a lesser sentence if she testified against her mother, who eventually received two life terms.\n\nIn fact had it not been for President Barack Obama, there is a good chance Smith may never have seen her son play.\n\nSmith was released last year after being named among 46 people serving prison time for drug offenses whose sentences were deemed unduly harsh by the Obama administration.\n\nSmith saw her son play live for the first time last month during the Broncos postseason win over the Pittsburgh Steelers -- leaving Mile High Stadium in Denver clutching a game ball that Peyton Manning had given to Thomas specifically to give to her.\n\nSunday's Super Bowl extravaganza against the Carolina Panthers will be only the second time Smith has seen Thomas play in person.\n\n\"She'll be here, she'll basically be proud because of all the ups and downs we went through and still be able to come to the Super Bowl, play in the NFL coming out of a small town, she'll be very proud,\" Thomas told reporters at a media event here.\n\n- 'It means the world' -\n\nThe star wide receiver admitted he was nervous about how his mother would cope with the occasion after so many years in relative isolation.\n\n\"She's probably nervous right now. It's her second time flying and then just being around all the people,\" Thomas said. \"She hasn't been around a lot of people, especially like it'll be right now for the Super Bowl. I think she'll be fine, but it'll be a little different.\"\n\nThomas, 28, admitted he is still pinching himself that his mother, who was arrested when he was 11, is now a free woman.\n\n\"It means a lot. It's her second time coming to see me play. It kind of means the world,\" he said.\n\n\"Loss of words because I never thought I'd be in this situation where my mom would be able to come out and see me play. Now that she can, she's just as excited.\"\n\nSmith's words of encouragement from prison after Thomas's ill-fated Super Bowl debut two years ago -- when the Broncos were demolished 43-8 by the rampant Seattle Seahawks -- were crucial in helping him bounce back.\n\n\"After the last Super Bowl, she just said 'Keep your head up. Everything's going to be okay. You're going to get another chance. Next time, you just take advantage of it and get the win,'\" he revealed.\n\nOne of the first things Thomas did after his mother's release was purchase her a new home.\n\n\"I let her pick her own house in a neighborhood right now to get used to it,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"I don't know if she really wants to be around a lot of land with nobody around. Being gone that long and then just coming into a lot of land, I think it's kind of creepy for some people.\"\n\nDemaryius Thomas of the Denver Broncos, pictured on January 17, 2016, admitted he is still pinching himself that his mother, who was arrested when he was 11, is now a free woman \u00a9Justin Edmonds (Getty/AFP/File)",

                    "title": "John Fox Bowl: Bears coach's fingerprints on both Super Bowl teams",
                    "body": "Bears coach John Fox's fingerprints are on both teams in Super Bowl 50, and there's no bigger evidence of his influence on his two previous employers than the presence of Peyton Manning for what could be the final game in the Broncos quarterback's brilliant career.\n\nThe sexy storyline is that one Hall of Fame quarterback -- Broncos general manager John Elway -- used his friendship with the future Hall of Famer Manning to help convince him to sign with the Broncos in March 2012 after he had been released by the Colts.\n\nTen teams reached out to Manning and he had been buddies with Elway on the golf course, and that provided the Broncos with perhaps an added edge as Manning ultimately met with four other teams -- the Cardinals, Dolphins, Titans and 49ers -- before selecting Denver.\n\nThere were a lot of reasons for Manning to choose the Broncos, not the least of which were wide receivers Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker (since departed), and a young left tackle in Ryan Clady. But a strong case can be made that Fox was the ultimate factor for Manning, a proven coach with a history of being popular with his players and guiding excellent defensive units. In Denver, Manning could run his no-huddle offense in the altitude and Fox and defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio, whom Manning liked, could handle the defense.\n\nIt was a pairing that helped guide the Broncos to the Super Bowl two years ago in New York, and here they are again set to face the Panthers on Sunday at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. Turnover often defines the NFL, and the Broncos have 13 players on their 53-man roster who played in Super Bowl XLVIII, including three starters on each side of the ball. It's important to note three standouts on defense -- outside linebacker Von Miller, end Derek Wolfe and cornerback Chris Harris -- were on injured reserve for that crushing loss to the Seahawks.\n\nRon Rivera, of course, took over the Panthers from Fox in 2011. Five players remain on the Panthers' roster from Fox's nine-year run in Carolina and are integral to the team's core makeup -- linebacker Thomas Davis, defensive end Charles Johnson, center Ryan Kalil, running back Jonathan Stewart and long snapper J.J. Jansen.\n\nBut Fox's imprint is naturally greater in Denver, where the coach mandated a shift toward running the ball more halfway through last season. The Broncos didn't get things sorted out in time to make a deep playoff run, but the carryover to this season has served them well. Fox believed the offense had to start complementing the defense, and that is very much what the team has done this season with coordinator Wade Phillips' unit ranking No. 1 against the run and the pass.\n\n\"Fox brought a lot of us in,\" said inside linebacker Danny Trevathan, a sixth-round pick in 2012 who led the Broncos in tackles this season. \"He gave us a chance. But we've got to take care of this game here.\"\n\nFox played a role in big and small moves in Denver. The Broncos were about out of money for undrafted free agents in 2011 when one of the team's scouts, Dave Ziegler, presented him with three options at cornerback for a player who was going to get a mere $2,000 bonus offer. One had big-time speed. One had good size and was from a major program. One was smart and played four years at Kansas. Sign the smart one, Fox said. That player turned out to be Harris.\n\n\"We all came in with Coach Fox,\" Harris said. \"He developed us for four years, developed me, Von, other guys. We've lost a lot in free agency, but he worked with so many of us, so he definitely has an imprint on this team. But Coach (Gary) Kubiak changed our style, (defensive coordinator) Wade changed our defense. The offense is totally different. Scheme-wise we're a totally different team, but Foxy did a good job of developing us.\"\n\nAs the Bears prepare for Year 2 with Fox, one of his former teams is on the verge of the game's ultimate triumph. With any luck, observers will be tracing moves by Fox that have paid off at Halas Hall sooner rather than later.\n\nbmbiggs@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @BradBiggs",

                    "body": "That was my prediction before the 2015 NFL season started and since I'm generally right about everything, I flew to Las Vegas immediately after making that prediction and made a bet on my pick. Now, I'm one Broncos win away from cashing in my ticket, quitting my job and moving to Barbados for the rest of my life.\n\nActually, I like my job, so I probably won't quit, I'll just commute from Barbados.\n\nThe best part about moving to Barbados is that I won't have to listen to people argue about whether or not Steven Avery actually did it. I got a haircut the other day and my barber kept talking about the Avery case. Let me just say when someone's holding a pair of scissors to my head, the last thing I want to hear them talk about is murder. Literally anything else would fine.\n\nAnother storyline this week has been race and whether or not it's a factor with Cam Newton. Here's all I have to say about race and the Super Bowl: There have only been two African-American quarterbacks in NFL history who have won a Super Bowl and guess what, both of them beat the Broncos (Russell Wilson, Doug Williams). Advantage, Panthers.\n\nPersonally, my favorite storyline of the week involves John Fox. Fox used to coach BOTH of these teams. Fox took the Panthers to the Super Bowl in 2003 and the Broncos in 2013. Unfortunately for Fox, he lost in the Super Bowl both times and he ended up getting fired from both jobs. Now both of his old teams are back in the Super Bowl.\n\nBasically, the Bears should fire Fox tomorrow, which will pretty much guarantees them a trip to the Super Bowl down the road. It worked for the Panthers and Broncos, so there's no reason it shouldn't work for the Bears.\n\nI'm going to stop talking about the Bears, though, because they're not in the Super Bowl and nobody cares about them right now.\n\nLet's get to the thing that everyone does care about: MY SUPER BOWL PICK.\n\nNow, just because I picked the Broncos to win the Super Bowl before the season started doesn't mean I'm going to pick them to win now. But I might. I don't want to give you any hints until you get to my pick at the bottom of the page.\n\nHowever, before we get to my pick, let me remind you that you can check out the Super Bowl pick from every CBSSports.com expert by clicking here. I don't want to spoil things, but I'll tell you this: Out of our eight experts, five picked the Panthers and three picked the Broncos.\n\nAlso, I'm the only one moving to Barbados if the Broncos win.\n\nBefore I decided exactly which way I was going to go with my Super Bowl pick, I wanted to see Peyton Manning in person, so I got on a plane, flew to San Francisco and went to Media Day on Monday, which isn't even technically called Media Day anymore because it's called Super Bowl Opening Night.\n\nSome people hate media day, but I'm actually a fan of the event because where else in the world would I ever get to see Miss Universe dab.\n\nThat's the same Miss Universe who almost wasn't Miss Universe because Steve Harvey forgot who actually won the Miss Universe pageant. Basically, it's a good thing Jim Nantz is handing out the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday and not Harvey.\n\nAnyway, back to Peyton. The most surprising thing about his appearance at Opening Night is that he actually looks healthy. It looks like he's been eating a few less chicken parms and a few more apples. Now, that doesn't mean he's going to throw for 413 yards against the Panthers, but it does mean he could surprise the Panthers with his arm strength and ability to throw downfield.\n\nOn the other hand, the Broncos might not even need a huge game from Manning because this game's going to come down to whether or not the Broncos defense can stop Cam Newton. The Broncos aren't going to win a shootout and if the Panthers hit the 30-point mark, there's a 196 percent chance they're going to win.\n\nThat being said, you've probably heard that defense wins championships, and if that's the case, then Carolina might want to forfeit.\n\nThe Broncos defense finished ranked No. 1 overall in the NFL this regular season, which is usually a good sign for a Super Bowl team. Of the 11 teams before 2015 that went into a Super Bowl with the top-ranked defense, nine of them won. I think it's going to be 10 after Sunday.\n\nIncluding the playoffs, the Broncos have played a total of 18 games this season and 14 of those have been decided by one score. That means that neither team gets blown out when the Broncos play.\n\nOn Sept. 9, 2015, I said the Broncos would win Super Bowl 50 and that Peyton Manning would be named MVP. I'm sticking by both predictions. The oldest quarterback to ever start a Super Bowl is going to send me to Barbados.\n\nOf course, I'm going to have stop in Vegas first to cash in my ticket. And you know what? Instead of moving to Barbados, I could use my winnings to bet on the Broncos again next season!\n\nJust kidding. That'd be crazy. I'm all-in on the Browns for 2016.\n\nCarson Palmer used to play for the Bengals and if you play for the Bengals or have ever played for the Bengals, there's a 100 percent chance that you'll have a playoff meltdown. It's a fact of life. It happened to this year's Bengals. It happened to last year's Bengals. It even happened to the 2009 Bengals that Carson Palmer played for.\n\nYou know what? Maybe it's not the Bengals' fault. Maybe it's just the city of Cincinnati.\n\nWorst Pick: Broncos fans, I'm not going to lie, I flaked out on you last week. When I turned in my pick for the AFC title game, I originally went with Denver. However, after eating some Funyons and mulling it over, I decided to go with the Patriots in the final draft that made it to the site. Switching my pick was a total choke job on my part and as soon as I did it, I wanted to switch it back, but I didn't because then I would've just switched back again and then I'm pretty sure my entire pick would've read like a jumbled incoherent mess.\n\nAnyway, the joke's on me for switching my pick, but also, the joke's on all of us for letting a groundhog decide when winter ends.",

                    "title": "Super Bowl 50 has got everything - apart from a true villain to hate",
                    "body": "Super Bowl 50 has almost everything. The game will feature the top-seeded team from the NFC versus the No1 team in the AFC. It will have two great defenses. And it will showcase an aging quarterback legend trying to win what could be his last game against a team led by the best quarterback of the younger generation. There's nothing there not to like.\n\nBut there is something big missing from Super Bowl 50.\n\nNo, not Roman numerals. You Roman numeral diehards had your XLIX years in the sun and now it's over. The Roman numeral empire has fallen. It's time to accept that.\n\nWhat Super Bowl 50 is missing is a villain. All epic dramas have a villain and Panthers-Broncos is unfortunately lacking one.\n\n\"But Cam Newton!\"\n\nNo. Cam Newton is not a true villain. Sure, he may be one among a very vocal minority of angry people on your Facebook feed, in the Letters to the Editor section of the Charlotte Observer and to our more hopelessly washed-up sportswriters.\n\nBut to the vast majority of the country, he's a good quarterback who enjoys playing football. We as a society can't give the \"villain\" title to everyone who is hated by angry people on Facebook. If we do, everyone must be called a villain because people on Facebook generally despise all things.\n\nPeyton Manning is not the villain either. If this was baseball, sure - December's HGH allegation would result in the future Hall of Famer getting booed in every stadium he steps into. And I wouldn't have used the term \"future Hall of Famer\" in the previous sentence, as he would forever marked with a scarlet HGH. But this is football. Fans either don't care about banned substances or don't believe (or don't want to believe) Manning took any. Right or wrong, Manning will be the subject of countless tributes and media paeans this week. Not exactly the stuff of villains.\n\nSo, then, who do we turn to for the villain role?\n\nLast year we had the New England Patriots playing under the Deflategate allegations and, more importantly, they were the Patriots: football's premier villain. The year before that we had Richard Sherman, whose vocal trashing of an opponent is, without question, far more disrespectful than all of Cam Newton's celebratory dances combined.\n\nThe Super Bowl before that, it was Ray Lewis and his deer antler spray. And IV years ago we had the Patriots again. Go back IV or XLIX Super Bowls and, in most of them, there's been a team or a player in the villain role. There's been someone to root against.\n\nEven a coach will do. In many recent Super Bowls, Bill Belichick has been cast in the dark lord role quite well. Three years ago we had the Harbaugh bros, who are both punchable in their own way. But Super Bowl 50 has Gary Kubiak and Ron Rivera. Kubiak seems like your good-natured and straight-laced uncle or high school gym teacher and the only scandalous thing Ron Rivera has ever done is pose for a picture with his Chicago BARES teammates. It gets even worse below the head coach level. Denver defensive coordinator Wade Phillips might be the nicest, most human man in all of football. He's someone you feel the need to openly root for, not against. How awful.\n\nThe fanbases don't help much either. Despite Denver playing in its eighth Super Bowl all-time, tied for the most with the Cowboys, Patriots and Steelers, its fans aren't loathed to the same degree as the supporters of other successful franchises. Granted, Raiders, Chargers and Chiefs fans may disagree with that statement. But compare the schadenfreude-fueled glee felt from sea to shining sea when the Patriots are eliminated from the postseason to the national mood when the Broncos lose.\n\nThere's no sense that spontaneous celebrations could break out anywhere at any moment. Maybe it's because the Broncos have only won two Super Bowls, and none in 17 years, so the envy factor isn't there. Or maybe it's because Denver isn't in a huge, coastal media market that constantly bombards the rest of the country with profiles of their fans' supposed superiority. Or maybe it's because when we think of Broncos fans, we don't picture someone who is smug and obnoxious, but a shirtless man trapped inside a barrel.\n\nIt's pretty hard to hate a shirtless man trapped in a barrel.\n\nThe Panthers simply haven't been around long enough for anyone to get a good dislike going for them. In 20 years of play before this season, Carolina made one Super Bowl and was quarterbacked in it by Jake Delhomme, making the general feeling towards Panthers fans a mix between apathy and pity. (And, among more geographically challenged fans, also probably some confusion as to where this \"Carolina\" place even is.)\n\nOf course, all of this could change by the end of Super Bowl 50. The more jealous among us will no doubt quickly grow to despise the fans and players of the winning team. \"Panthers fans are a bunch of bandwagoners!\" Or: \"I'm so sick of the Broncos being in every postseason!\" And some player could do or say something in the lead up to the game that turns us all against him. Maybe there's a Eugene Robinson somewhere in these likable rosters. But for now, pre-kickoff, the Broncos and Panthers are just two really good football teams set to play the biggest game of the year. Nothing more, nothing less, nothing villainous.\n\nWithout a true villain, we may all just have to watch the game strictly for the love of sport and competition and entertainment. It feels weird, but I guess I'm willing to give it a try. Just this once.",

Today, Chalk NFL handicapper Dave Tuley breaks down the Denver Broncos' 2015 season, including a game-by-game look.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 future-book odds: 9-1 at start of regular season\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2015, the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook posted its Super Bowl 50 futures, and Denver opened as the fourth choice at 8-1 (behind Seattle, New England and Green Bay). But that was before Peyton Manning looked terrible in a divisional playoff loss to Indianapolis. The Broncos were raised to 14-1 and bounced back and forth between 14-1 and 12-1 through the winter and spring. By the preseason, with Manning back in form, the Broncos were lowered to 8-1 and opened the season at 9-1. In the AFC futures, they were the third choice at 7-2 behind only New England and Indianapolis (both at 3-1).",

                    "body": "Nope, we're not gearing up early for the 4th of July. This Sunday is -- lightning strikes, thunder crashes -- Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nBut that's our first and last bad joke about the game's modern excess. In all earnestness, Super Bowl 50 between the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos (Feb. 7 at 6:30 p.m. EST on CBS) has the potential to be one of the better NFL championships in recent memory. We've got stars, storylines and subplots galore to mentally masticate before Sunday's kickoff.\n\nWithout further ado, let's get into it. Our Super Bowl 50 preview includes a look at the game's most irresistible narrative, a throwback person of interest and a succinct-yet-through rundown of each team's chances.\n\nAt first blush, you couldn't pit two more different quarterbacks against one another.\n\nIn one corner: Peyton Manning. He's old (39), he's a classically immobile pocket-passer, and he's a mild-mannered, overall dad-looking guy whose own father was an NFL quarterback, too. To borrow a figure of speech from this election cycle, Manning is our Establishment Candidate.\n\nThen there's Cam Newton. He's young (26), he's a threat both running and passing, and he dances in the end zone after scores. Some old fuddy-duddies think he's Everything Wrong With the World Today.\n\nManning has reportedly told friends that Super Bowl 50 will be his final NFL game. Newton's journey is just beginning -- a Panthers victory Sunday would make the him the first quarterback in history to win a Super Bowl, a college championship and the Heisman Trophy.\n\nBetween now and kickoff, you'll read and hear many stories contrasting the two QBs. You'll see criticism of Newton, criticism of the criticism of Newton, and criticism of that criticism. You'll hear some people lionize Manning relentlessly, and you'll see others bury him before he's played his final game. It will all get more than a bit nauseating.\n\nBut know one thing above all else: For all their visible differences, Newton and Manning are carved from the same granite. Both are revelations at their position, both are inspiring leaders and both now have their teams on the doorstep of a Super Bowl championship.\n\nIf you only watch one NFL game per year and that game is the Super Bowl, no one will hold more intrigue or inspiration Sunday than Michael Oher. Oher, now almost 30 years old, was made famous as a teenager in Michael Lewis' book The Blind Side, as well the Oscar-winning movie of the same name starring Sandra Bullock.\n\nOher grew up bouncing around foster homes as a kid, even missing school for more than a year when he was about 10 years old. Eventually, Oher was taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Bullock in the movie) and her husband, Sean Tuohy. Oher was a talented athlete, and the stability and structure provide by the Tuohys helped him grow into a football prodigy at the left tackle position.\n\nThe Blind Side made Oher unusually famous for a college offensive lineman while playing at Ole Miss. The movie version was released in 2009, the same year he was drafted in the first round by the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nDespite his fame and hype, however, the success of Oher's NFL career hasn't matched the popularity of his story. Not long after he appeared to be potentially out the league for good, the 29-year-old now anchors Carolina's offensive line and will play for his second career Super Bowl ring on Sunday.\n\nThe Broncos were involved in a small car accident on the way back from practice Monday. That's certainly not an ideal way to start Super Bowl week.\n\nLuckily, no one was hurt and the Broncos can resume preparing for the big game. Now, here are three things to know about Denver heading into Super Bowl 50.\n\nWhile the Broncos' Super Bowl prep week got off to a rough start, Newton touched down in California for the game rocking some righteous Versace pants.\n\nAre these early omens? We have no idea, but below are three important things to know about the Panthers heading into Super Bowl 50.\n\nManning is a living legend, but he simply can't make the long throws he used to. Expect him to be better than a disaster on Sunday, but watching him play as a shadow of his former self could be a bit depressing. With Manning limited, the real battle will be between Carolina's potent offense and Denver's lockdown defense.\n\nNewton has rebuffed his critics time and time again with his on-field production this year, and appears primed to do so again. While a Denver win would be a nice bow on top of Manning's career, expect a 27-17 Panthers win and the official dawn of a new NFL era.\n\nThis is Cam Newton's league now, and Sunday will be his coronation.",

I give Elway a ton of credit for seeing the end of Peyton's career coming and knowing what wins games. You cannot outscore people every week. They play great defense, they will try to run the ball and find ways to play-action.\n\nDenver will cover Carolina's wideouts. The Broncos are formidable up front defensively, Wade Phillips is outstanding as a coordinator, they are good in the secondary. The only holes line up with the two things Carolina can do. One is Cam [Newton's] ability to run. Denver had some issues with Alex Smith picking up key third-down conversions. Cam can do that. The other matchup is Greg Olsen against Denver's safeties, who are very average to me. Their corners are special and I would not be surprised to see them match one of their better corners on Olsen.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think Carolina is too good on defense. Denver will not do much offensively. The run game will be shut down. Carolina will be able to pressure Manning. Cam will make enough big plays with his feet to win the game.",

                    "body": "Panthers reporter David Newton and Broncos reporter Jeff Legwold take an in-depth look at the Super Bowl 50 matchup between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers.\n\nBeat Steelers 23-16 in divisional playoffs and beat Patriots 20-18 in AFC Championship Game\n\nThe Broncos carry a little history into Super Bowl 50. Denver's 11 victories by seven or fewer points -- regular season and postseason combined -- are the most by any team in the Super Bowl era.\n\nThe Broncos are also the first team to overcome a 14-point deficit and win against three teams that eventually made the playoffs. They did so with quarterback Peyton Manning starting nine games (7-2) and Brock Osweiler starting seven (5-2) in the regular season.\n\n\"Like I've said from the get-go, our defense has gotten us to this point,\" Manning said. \"Let's make that very clear.\"\n\nThe Broncos have plenty of defensive star power. Quarterbacks have avoided throwing to receivers shadowed by Chris Harris Jr. or Aqib Talib -- both Pro Bowl selections.\n\nBecause of that, Bradley Roby is often targeted. Roby, who has the look of a future starter, has played as the team's third cornerback. He is such a good tackler that the Broncos have also used him at safety in the base defense. They call the look \"single,\" as in one safety on the field.\n\nWhen Roby holds up in coverage, the Broncos stop the run and their defense dominates.\n\nYes, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, with his 45 combined touchdowns (35 passing, 10 rushing), is expected to be the league's MVP. But the Broncos' defense has been next-level all season.\n\nThe Broncos have beaten Joe Flacco, Teddy Bridgewater, Matthew Stafford, Aaron Rodgers and Jay Cutler to go with two wins over Philip Rivers and two wins over Tom Brady, including in the AFC Championship Game.\n\nThey beat five teams that made this year's playoff field. The Panthers beat just three but none since Nov. 8. Also, the Panthers allowed one 100-yard rusher (Jamaal Charles in Week 2). The Broncos surrendered a league-low 3.3 yards per rushing attempt.\n\nA team that has walked the tightrope this long is bound to fall. If a handful of their close wins had gone the other way -- if the defense had not made play after game-changing play -- their season would've had a far different look.\n\nNewton is also the multidimensional threat the Broncos have not seen this season. He has guided the league's highest-scoring offense to 31.3 points per game.\n\nThe Broncos' offense has not shown it can match that. The Panthers' defense has the kind of personnel and scheme that could consistently pressure Manning. They have a plus-20 turnover margin this season and lead the league in interceptions, with 24. The Panthers have the exact profile that gives the Broncos' offense the most trouble.\n\nThere are all kinds of rational reasons to pick the Panthers. The team is young and talented, with the impact player at quarterback in Newton.\n\nBut there is something about these Broncos. They win close games, they batter opposing quarterbacks, and they simply do not flinch -- no matter how tight the situation.\n\nThe Broncos also aren't just good on defense. They are game-wrecking good, and they have battered even the best quarterbacks the league has to offer and made them tentative in the pocket.\n\nToss in that Super Bowl 50 could well be Manning's \"last rodeo,\" and the Broncos have both talent and inspiration. Broncos 24, Panthers 21. -- Jeff Legwold\n\nBeat Seahawks 31-24 in divisional playoffs and beat Cardinals 49-15 in NFC Championship Game.\n\nThe Panthers' season began with predictions of gloom and doom because star wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin suffered a season-ending knee injury in training camp. Forgotten was that Carolina had a defense ranked among the top 10 for three consecutive years. They Panthers had a healthy quarterback, Cam Newton, and a star tight end, Greg Olsen. They also had a reliable back, Jonathan Stewart, running behind a solid offensive line. The defense lived up to its billing once again, but what got Carolina to the Super Bowl was the emergence of Newton playing at MVP level. That the Panthers led the NFL in scoring (31.2 PPG) with the No. 6 defense created a magical season.\n\nDon't overlook rookie wide receiver Devin Funchess. He was dubbed the heir apparent to Benjamin in training camp, but that never transpired because of the play of Ted Ginn Jr. (10 touchdown catches) and Philly Brown. Ginn and Brown made huge plays in the NFC title game, and their speed is always a factor. But Funchess, at 6-foot-5, is a big target with speed. He has only three catches for 33 yards in the playoffs, but one of those catches was for a touchdown. In the regular-season finale, he had seven catches for 120 yards and a touchdown. He's capable of going off at any moment.\n\nThe Broncos haven't faced a running quarterback like Newton all season. Newton had 10 rushing touchdowns during the regular season and two more in the NFC Championship Game. He won't be fazed by the league's No. 1 defense. He helped put up 31 points on Seattle's second-ranked defense in the first half of the divisional playoff game. He led Carolina to a rout of Arizona, which had the league's No. 5 defense, in the NFC title game. With the way the offensive line and receivers are playing around Newton, he is almost impossible to stop.\n\nThe Broncos have allowed only 64.5 rushing yards per game in the playoffs. They allowed only 83.6 rushing yards per game during the regular season. They need to make Newton one-dimensional and keep this close early. In the playoffs, the Panthers outscored Seattle and Arizona 55-7 in the first half. ... Then there's Manning. He has been a special player throughout his career, and this could be his swan song. His arm strength might be suspect, but so has been the Carolina secondary at times in the playoffs. That group has allowed four touchdown passes and an average of 276 passing yards per game.\n\nThe Panthers seem to have the \"it\" factor the Seahawks did two years ago, when they won the Super Bowl. The Panthers are built a lot like Seattle, with a strong running game designed around a dual-threat quarterback and strong defense. But what will decide this game will be turnovers. The Panthers forced seven in the NFC Championship Game and two in the divisional round. Luke Kuechly had an interception returned for a touchdown in each of those games. He's not a member of what the secondary calls \"Thieves Avenue,\" but he should be. Panthers 24, Broncos 14. -- David Newton",

                    "title": "Super Bowl 50: Five-part plan for Panthers to beat Broncos",
                    "body": "Despite the Panthers' reputation as a defensive juggernaut, Carolina landed in Super Bowl 50 on the strength of a high-powered offense that lights up scoreboards like a pinball machine. The Panthers averaged a league-high 31.2 points during the regular season, utilizing a diversified offensive approach that seamlessly blends traditional run/pass concepts with zone-read packages and an explosive quarterback running game. Under offensive coordinator Mike Shula's guidance, the Panthers have scored 30-plus points in eight of their last nine games (including the playoffs), averaging 36.1 points and 385.3 total yards during that span.\n\nWhile those numbers are certainly noteworthy, it is the creative scheming from Shula that stands out when I study the All-22 Coaches Film. The longtime offensive assistant has befuddled defenses with his opening scripts to help the Panthers outscore opponents 266-121 in the first halves of games during the regular season. The fast starts have continued in the playoffs, with the Panthers outscoring Seattle and Arizona by a combined first-half margin of 55-7. Most impressively, the Panthers have scored six touchdowns and two field goals in 13 first-half possessions; that kind of pace puts the opposing offense in a hole from the opening whistle.\n\nGiven the Broncos' offensive woes this season, Shula would be wise to keep his foot on the gas from the first snap. From using a variety of run-heavy personnel groupings like \"12\" (1 RB, 2 TEs and 2 WRs) and \"22\" (2 RBs, 2 TEs and 1WR) to mixing in a gadget play within the \"First 15\" (opening script) to catch the defense by surprise, the crafty play caller should come out on the attack to put the Broncos' star-studded defense on its heels.\n\nAgainst Arizona in the NFC Championship Game, the Panthers executed a reverse from a run-heavy set with an unbalanced line to catch the Cardinals off guard, as you can see in the video below. The extra offensive linemen to the right signal a possible power run to the right by alignment. However, quarterback Cam Newton executes a zone-read fake, heads to the right and flips the ball to receiver Ted Ginn on the end-around. The speedster turns the corner and makes a nifty move to score a 22-yard touchdown on a perfectly blocked gadget play:\n\nWith the Broncos likely intent on slowing down Newton and the Panthers' powerful running game, Shula could dig into his bag of tricks to spring a flea flicker, reverse or halfback pass to take advantage of an ultra-aggressive unit prone to flying to the ball with reckless abandon.\n\nThe Panthers bludgeon opponents with a hard-hitting running game that blends misdirection and deception with downhill tactics. The combination of power, counter and zone runs with an occasional quarterback keeper or end-around forces defenders to read and react instead of flowing freely to the ball. Given the challenge of blocking DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller on the edges, the use of various read concepts will allow Newton to decide whether to give or keep the ball based off the reaction of the ultra-athletic defenders.\n\nThe All-22 Coaches Film makes it clear the Panthers frequently use read-option concepts to create big plays on the ground. Against Arizona, the Panthers executed an inside zone with fly motion to generate an \"explosive\" run, as you can see in the play below. Receiver Corey Brown motions across the formation and fakes taking a handoff to the left. Running back Jonathan Stewart heads to the left, executing an inside zone to the right. Newton takes the snap and puts the ball into Stewart's belly when Markus Golden overreacts to Brown. With Newton a threat to keep it and run, the Cardinals race to the edge to stop the quarterback sweep, leaving a huge void for Stewart. The big-bodied runner eventually picks up 23 yards on a creative running play (TO VIEW THE PLAY, SCROLL LEFT TO RIGHT ON THE IMAGE BELOW):\n\nIn addition to using simple read-option concepts, the Panthers will run power plays with reads attached to the play. Against Atlanta in Week 14, they ran a counter play, with Newton bluffing a read fake, as you can see below. Prior to the snap, tight end Greg Olsen motions into the backfield into an H-Back position. Tackle Mike Remmers pulls to the left to take out unblocked Falcons DE (Tyson Jackson) at the point of attack. Newton sticks the ball in Stewart's belly and runs out the fake, leading several Falcons to chase him to the perimeter. With the middle open, Stewart bursts through the hole for a 44-yard gain (TO VIEW THE PLAY, SCROLL LEFT TO RIGHT ON THE IMAGE BELOW):\n\nAgainst Philadelphia in Week 7, the Panthers are aligned in a trey formation, as you can see below. Prior to the snap, receiver Jerricho Cotchery executes yo-yo motion before returning to the slot. Guard Trai Turner and Olsen pull to the left as part of a power-read blocking scheme. Newton sticks the ball into Stewart's belly and runs to the right after the handoff. With Newton prone to running quarterback sweeps, the Eagles race to the perimeter, leaving a void in the middle of the line. Stewart follows his blocks and rumbles for a 36-yard gain (TO VIEW THE PLAY, SCROLL LEFT TO RIGHT ON THE IMAGE BELOW):\n\nWith the Panthers rushing for 100-plus yards in 31 straight games (including the playoffs) behind a creative approach that leaves defenders dazed and confused at the point of attack, Shula would be wise to test the discipline and awareness of the Broncos' ultra-aggressive front seven.\n\nWhenever a quarterback accounts for 45 total touchdowns (35 passing, 10 rushing) in a single season, he becomes the focal point of the offensive plan, particularly down in the red zone, where points are at a premium. When the primary playmaker is a 6-foot-5, 245-pound dual-threat scorer with a rare combination of size, strength, athleticism and arm talent, the play caller should craft a plan that maximizes his scoring potential on every play.\n\nIn Carolina, the Panthers have become one of the NFL's most efficient red-zone offenses due to Newton's emergence as the \"Ultimate Scoring Machine\" in his fifth pro season. The MVP candidate has always terrorized opponents as a runner near the goal line, but his rapid improvement as a pocket passer has made him nearly impossible to defend. Newton is a fastball pitcher capable of fitting the ball into tight windows on laser-like tosses to the back of the end zone.\n\nAlthough arm strength is vastly overrated in the evaluation process, Newton's exceptional zip and velocity allow him to squeeze the ball into small cracks between multiple defenders. With Newton also displaying spot-on ball placement and accuracy, the Panthers' franchise player has quietly become one of the best red-zone passers in the NFL. Since 2014, Newton has compiled a 105.6 passer rating and posted a 39:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio in the red zone. Most impressively, he has thrown 26 red-zone touchdown passes in 2015 without recording a single pick.\n\nLooking at the All-22 Coaches Film, it's clear Newton's ability to drill seams and slant routes has been a huge part of the Panthers' red-zone offense. He has a tremendous feel for the timing of the play, and his ball placement has been superb when defenders are draped on his receivers' backs. On the 5-yard touchdown pass to Devin Funchess in the video below, from the NFC Championship Game, Newton's pinpoint accuracy and ball placement make the difference. Notice how he delivers the ball low and away from the defender. Quarterbacks are taught to throw the ball down and away to reduce the chances of a tip or deflection that could lead to an interception in the red zone. Newton has finally mastered the concept, and it has helped him avoid costly turnovers near the goal line:\n\nDespite Newton's success as a passer, I believe he is the most dangerous red-zone weapon in the NFL due to his exceptional running skills. He shines executing the quarterback run game, particularly the QB sweep and power inside the 10-yard line. Although these plays are routinely executed by dual-threat quarterbacks at the collegiate level, it is rare for an NFL quarterback to attack the middle or the edges on power-based runs. Newton, however, thrives on these plays, due to his extraordinary combination of size, strength and power.\n\nDefenses play 11-on-10 when the quarterback isn't involved in the run as a runner or blocker -- but Newton makes it possible for the Panthers to even up the numbers. The clever utilization of Newton as a runner near the goal line has certainly played a huge role in the team's impressive red-zone efficiency.\n\nAgainst Arizona, the Panthers used Newton on a quarterback sweep to take advantage of the numbers count on the back side, as you can see below. The Panthers align in a trix formation, with Mike Tolbert instructed to motion to the three-receiver side prior to the snap. The Cardinals are in man coverage, and Tolbert's motion pulls the middle linebacker out of the box. Newton is instructed to run around the end behind a pair of pullers (Turner and center Ryan Kalil). The Panthers' star is able to waltz into the end zone on a cleverly designed play (TO VIEW THE PLAY, SCROLL LEFT TO RIGHT ON THE IMAGE BELOW):\n\nGiven the Broncos' defensive problems in the red zone (Denver finished 2015 ranked 20th in red-zone efficiency, with 22 touchdowns allowed in 37 red-zone possessions) and their tendency to play man coverage, Newton's skills as a dynamic dual threat could lead to points for the Panthers when they reach the red area.\n\nAs crazy as it sounds to dare one of the most prolific passers in NFL history to win the game on the strength of his right arm, the Panthers must force the veteran to make plays from the pocket. Manning finished the regular season with the second-most interceptions in the league (17) despite playing in only 10 games, and his 67.9 passer rating was the lowest of any qualified starter in the NFL. Thus, the Panthers must get him out of his recently discovered comfort zone as a \"game manager\" and force him to make plays as a passer.\n\nStudying the All-22 Coaches Film and the heat map of Manning's throws from the pocket, it's clear that the 18th-year pro is a \"dink and dunk\" passer capable of only delivering accurate passes to the short and intermediate areas of the field. During the regular season, Manning targeted 62 percent of his passes within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage, connecting on 69.9 percent of those throws with a 4:9 touchdown-to-interception ratio. In the playoffs, he has continued to primarily work the short area of the field (63 percent of his targets are within 10 yards of the line), and he has attempted more passes at intermediate range (35 percent of his targets in the playoffs are between 10 and 19 yards from the line in the postseason, up from 24 percent during the regular season) with moderate success (54 percent completion rate and a 2:0 touchdown-to-interception ratio).\n\nManning has been at his best throwing the quick game at short range and dig/comebacks at intermediate range. I noticed that Manning is most effective at intermediate range (10 to 19 yards) throwing to digs and comebacks to his right, which is Josh Norman's normal territory as the left cornerback in the Panthers' zone-based scheme. In addition, Manning also tosses a number of balls over the middle, which is where linebacker Luke Kuechly roams between the hashes. (Interesting note: Manning has directed 20 of his 24 pass attempts at intermediate range to the right or middle of the field during the playoffs.)\n\nFor most of the season, the Panthers have been able to feast on quarterbacks forced to throw against loaded zones in obvious passing situations. The Panthers run a zone-based cover scheme that allows defenders to keep their eyes on the ball, which leads to more interceptions off tips and overthrows. In addition, the Panthers' underneath defenders excel at reading and recognizing route concepts, which allows them to make breaks well before the ball is thrown in their area. This has not only led to more interceptions from the unit, but it has helped the Panthers record six pick-sixes this season (including in the playoffs) and lead the NFL in takeaways.\n\nKuechly's interception in the NFC title game is a perfect example of how the Panthers' zone scheme creates problems for quarterbacks forced into \"pass-happy\" mode, as you can see in the video below. The Panthers are nursing a big lead and sitting back in a soft two-deep zone, with Kuechly instructed to read WR3 down the seam. He quickly retreats to his zone, reads the route and gets his eyes back to Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer prior to the throw. With great anticipation and instincts on display, Kuechly steals a pick and races to the end zone for a touchdown:\n\nThe Panthers have lived off the turnover this season, and Manning's propensity for giving the ball away (three pick-sixes in nine regular-season starts) makes it imperative for the defense to force the veteran to throw 30-plus times in Super Bowl 50.\n\nGiven Manning's limitations as a passer, it is obvious the Broncos want to run the ball early and often. The team has discovered a winning offensive formula down the stretch, and running the ball 30-plus times has been a huge part of Denver's success. The Broncos are unbeaten when posting at least 32 rushing attempts or 130-plus rushing yards. Thus, the Panthers must focus heavily on stopping the Broncos' zone-based running game, with Anderson and Hillman positioned as the \"dot\" back.\n\nAnderson, a third-year pro, has been the Broncos' most productive runner during the playoffs, exhibiting a rugged \"one-cut\" running style that allows him to attack downhill quickly against fast-flowing defenses. He routinely runs through contact in the hole, and his uncanny ability to fall forward keeps the Broncos ahead of the chains. To stop Anderson from churning out big yards, the Panthers need to eliminate the cutback lanes and force him to run towards the edges, where Thomas Davis and Kuechly can run him down.\n\nHillman poses a different set of problems, with his stop-start quickness and jitterbug running style. He has a knack for turning the corner on outside plays, yet he also flashes the agility and vision to spot a crease on the inside. Although he lacks the size to grind it out between the tackles, he is a threat to take it the distance from anywhere on the field. Thus, Davis and Kuechly need to have their antennas up when he is in the game to anticipate perimeter runs.\n\nIn addition, they can tap Kawann Short and Star Lotulelei on the hip to encourage them to maintain their gap discipline at the line of scrimmage. The Broncos' offense will attempt to chop down defenders at the point of attack to leave creases and cutback lanes; how well the interior defenders hold up could determine whether Hillman or Anderson enjoys success or gets rocked in the hole repeatedly by Kuechly and Davis.",

As expected, quarterbacks Cam Newton and Peyton Manning garnered the most attention during the two-hour event. Newton answered questions on facing backlash regarding his touchdown celebrations; why he decided to name his son \"Chosen\"; and how Atlanta's rap culture has impacted the world.\n\nManning, on the other hand, answered questions about his legacy in the NFL and dodged answering questions that focused on his likely retirement after Super Bowl 50. Other players who received a lot of media attention during the event included the Panthers' Josh Norman who wore a wrestling mask; the Broncos' Emmanuel Sanders, who wore Google Glasses; and Demaryius Thomas, who discussed his mother recently being pardoned by President Obama after spending years in prison.\n\nMedia day was a prime-time event held at the SAP Center in San Jose, California. It served as the opening of Super Bowl week, which will feature a slew of concerts, parties, and fan exhibits that will take place before the big game on Sunday.\n\nClick continue to view exclusive photos:\n\nPhotos: A.R.

                    "body": "That was my prediction before the 2015 NFL season started and since I'm generally right about everything, I flew to Las Vegas immediately after making that prediction and made a bet on my pick. Now, I'm one Broncos win away from cashing in my ticket, quitting my job and moving to Barbados for the rest of my life.\n\nActually, I like my job, so I probably won't quit, I'll just commute from Barbados.\n\nThe best part about moving to Barbados is that I won't have to listen to people argue about whether or not Steven Avery actually did it. I got a haircut the other day and my barber kept talking about the Avery case and let me just say that when someone's holding a pair of scissors to my head, the last thing I want to hear them talk about is murder. Literally anything else would fine.\n\nAnother storyline this week has been race and whether or not it's a factor with Cam Newton. Here's all I have to say about race and the Super Bowl: There have only been two African-American quarterbacks in NFL history who have won a Super Bowl and guess what, both of them beat the Broncos (Russell Wilson, Doug Williams). Advantage, Panthers.\n\nPersonally, my favorite storyline of the week involves John Fox. Fox used to coach BOTH of these teams. Fox took the Panthers to the Super Bowl in 2003 and the Broncos in 2013. Unfortunately for Fox, he lost in the Super Bowl both times and he ended up getting fired from both jobs. Now both of his old teams are back in the Super Bowl.\n\nBasically, the Bears should fire Fox tomorrow, which will pretty much guarantee them a trip to the Super Bowl down the road. It worked for the Panthers and Broncos, so there's no reason it shouldn't work for the Bears.\n\nI'm going to stop talking about the Bears though because they're not in the Super Bowl and nobody cares about them right now.\n\nLet's get to the thing that everyone does care about: MY SUPER BOWL PICK.\n\nNow, just because I picked the Broncos to win the Super Bowl before the season started doesn't mean I'm going to pick them to win now. But I might. I don't want to give you any hints until you get to my pick at the bottom of the page.\n\nHowever, before we get to my pick, let me remind you that you can check out the Super Bowl pick from every CBSSports.com expert by clicking here. I don't want to spoil things, but I'll tell you this: Out of our eight experts, five picked the Panthers and three picked the Broncos.\n\nAlso, I'm the only one moving to Barbados if the Broncos win.\n\nCarolina (17-1) vs. Denver (14-4) at Levi's Stadium, Feb. 7, 6:30 p.m. ET (CBS): Before I decided exactly which way I was going to go with my Super Bowl pick, I wanted to see Peyton Manning in person, so I got on a plane, flew to San Francisco and went to Media Day on Monday, which isn't even technically called Media Day anymore because it's called Super Bowl Opening Night.\n\nSome people hate media day, but I'm actually a fan of the event because where else in the world would I ever get to see Miss Universe dab.\n\nThat's the same Miss Universe who almost wasn't Miss Universe because Steve Harvey forgot who actually won the Miss Universe pageant. Basically, it's a good thing Jim Nantz is handing out the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday and not Harvey.\n\nAnyway, back to Peyton. The most surprising thing about his appearance at Media Day is that he actually looks healthy. It looks like he's been eating a few less chicken parms and a few more apples. Now, that doesn't mean he's going to throw for 413 yards against the Panthers, but it does mean he could surprise the Panthers with his arm strength and ability to throw downfield.\n\nOn the other hand, the Broncos might not even need a huge game from Manning because this game's going to come down to whether or not the Broncos defense can stop Cam Newton. The Broncos aren't going to win a shootout and if the Panthers hit the 30-point mark, there's a 196 percent chance they're going to win.\n\nThat being said, you've probably heard that defense wins championships, and if that's the case, then Carolina might want to forfeit.\n\nThe Broncos defense finished ranked No. 1 overall in the NFL this regular season, which is usually a good sign for a Super Bowl team. Of the 11 teams before 2015 that went into a Super Bowl with the top-ranked defense, nine of them won. I think it's going to be 10 after Sunday.\n\nIncluding the playoffs, the Broncos have played a total of 18 games this season and 14 of those have been decided by one score and which means that neither team gets blown out when the Broncos play.\n\nOn Sept. 9, 2015, I said the Broncos would win Super Bowl 50 and that Peyton Manning would be named MVP. I'm sticking by both predictions. The oldest quarterback to ever start a Super Bowl is going to send me to Barbados.\n\nOf course, I'm going to have stop in Vegas first to cash-in my ticket. And you know what? Instead of moving to Barbados, I could use my winnings to bet on the Broncos again next season!\n\nJust kidding. That'd be crazy. I'm all-in on the Browns for 2016.\n\nCarson Palmer used to play for the Bengals and if you play for the Bengals or have ever played for the Bengals, there's a 100 percent chance that you'll have a playoff meltdown. It's a fact of life. It happened to this year's Bengals. It happened to last year's Bengals. It even happened to the 2009 Bengals that Carson Palmer played for.\n\nYou know what? Maybe it's not the Bengals' fault. Maybe it's just the city of Cincinnati.\n\nWorst Pick: Broncos fans, I'm not going to lie, I flaked out on you last week. When I turned in my pick for the AFC title game, I originally went with Denver. However, after eating some Funyons and mulling it over, I decided to go with the Patriots in the final draft that made it to the site. Switching my pick was a total choke job on my part and as soon as I did it, I wanted to switch it back, but I didn't because then I would've just switched back again and then I'm pretty sure my entire pick would've read like a jumbled incoherent mess.\n\nAnyway, the joke's on me for switching my pick, but also, the joke's on all of us for letting a groundhog decide when winter ends.",

                    "body": "It's about time that the Carolina Panthers prove to everyone else in the league that they deserve this year's title; but in order to do that, they'll have to pass the tough competition in the form of the Denver Broncos. These two teams took very different roads to Super Bowl 50, with the Panthers demolishing the Arizona Cardinals in a one-sided affair, while the Broncos had to pull out all the tricks in the bag to clinch the AFC title against the New England Patriots.\n\nBut it's a whole new and different ballgame this time.\n\nThe Panthers registered one loss the entire year and their performances against the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round and against the Cardinals in the NFC title game should pretty much sum up the kind of season the team is having. One thing that the Broncos must seriously look into is the fact that the Panthers have learned their lesson of not letting their guard down. In their game against the Seahawks, they allowed Seattle to score a 24-0 run over them, almost costing them the game. But in the NFC championship game, the Panthers outscored and squashed the Cardinals 25-8 in the dying minutes of the game.\n\nThe point is if Carolina wants to assert its might, it definitely can.\n\nBut the Broncos are still the same team that can topple any team at any given night, so long as Peyton Manning is there. But what really made them reach this far is their dominating defense, which at the start of the season was suspect to many. To attest to the vast improvement of the team in defense, they were successful in keeping Tom Brady in check all throughout their game against the Patriots. The only problem for them is to maintain that, but this time, focusing on an even more challenging foe that features probably the best quarterback this season in Cam Newton.\n\nAnother argument going in the Broncos' favor is the fact that this is their second appearance in the Super Bowl in the last three seasons, although they were embarrassed by the Seahawks the last time. However, that doesn't change the fact that Manning will always be a great signal-caller no matter what sort of competition is given to him.\n\nAnd while they've come to rely on their defense to reach this far, there is a lot of doubt if it will be sufficient for them to pull off an upset in this one. The Panthers will win it.",

                    "body": "The Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos will battle it out on Sunday to be crowned champions of Super Bowl 50.\n\nThe NFL's best offence (the Panthers) go up against the best defence (the Broncos), with two of the league's most iconic quarterbacks fighting to see their team lift the Vince Lombardi trophy.\n\nAhead of the NFL's showpiece event, Sportsmail brings you the complete guide to the game, with everything you need to know.\n\nCarolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton will be looking to earn the franchise a first Super Bowl title\n\nWhen is it?\n\nSunday, February 7 at Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara. Kick-off is 3.30pm local time.\n\nAnd in the UK?\n\nThat translates to 11.30pm. Barring a power cut (as seen in New Orleans) or overtime (yet to be happen in a Super Bowl), it should finish around 3.30am.\n\nWhere can I watch it?\n\nThe BBC and Sky will broadcast the game live.\n\nSky Sports 1 HD (10pm), Sky Sports 3 HD (10pm), BBC 2 (10.50pm not Northern Ireland), BBC Red Button 1.\n\nWho are the participants?\n\nThe Carolina Panthers, the NFC's No 1 seed, meet the Denver Broncos, the AFC's No 1 seed.\n\nThe Denver Broncos, who boast the league's best defence, will be looking to stop Newton and the Panthers\n\nCOMPETITION: 50 GOLDEN TICKETS\n\nEnter now to win any one of 50 incredible prizes during Super Bowl week, Tuesday 2nd Feb - Sunday 7th Feb 2016\n\nWho's who?\n\nThe Broncos will wear white, the Panthers will be decked out in black. The logic is simple, according to John Elway, Broncos executive VP and general manager. 'We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms,' said Elway, who was the Broncos' QB in back-to-back Super Bowl wins in 1997 and 1998.\n\nAnd the winner will be...?\n\nAll signs point to Carolina. They are 17-1 this season and come into the game on the back of a 49-15 destruction of the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nIn Cam Newton, the Panthers possess a mobile quarterback with a rapier-like arm and a penchant for Superman celebrations. With top target Greg Olsen to aim at and a strong running game, Carolina built up the NFL's top scoring offense with 500 total points.\n\nWithout the ball, Carolina's defense is packed with playmakers on all three levels, with do-it-all, ball-hawking linebacker Luke Kuechly on top of his game.\n\nCarolina are the favourites, having lost just once this season and destroyed the Arizona Cardinals last week\n\nDo Denver have a chance?\n\nThe Broncos reached the Super Bowl two years ago and were blown away by the Seattle Seahawks, a team comparable with today's Panthers.\n\nBut under Wade Phillips, Denver have the No 1-ranked defense in the NFL. They left Tom Brady bemused and battered in the AFC Championship game, registering between 20 and 25 hits on the quarterback, depending on your source.\n\nThey have a running game which is improving as the season wears on and two top end receivers in Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders.\n\nWhat's on the line?\n\nPeyton Manning is expected to retire after his fourth Super Bowl. He is in the conversation for the best quarterback of all time, but his cause will be boosted by winning a second ring.\n\nAt 39, however, his powers are on the wane. But if he follows Elway in riding off into the sunset with a second Super Bowl, expect quite a send off. And tears.\n\nPeyton Manning, likely to retire after the game at the age of 39, has a final shot at a second Super Bowl ring\n\nAny interesting facts?\n\nThis is the first Super Bowl in which both starting quarterbacks are No 1 overall draft picks. Manning was taken first by the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 and Newton was No 1 overall 13 years later.\n\nThe Broncos are in their eighth Super Bowl (2-5), while the Panthers are playing in their second (0-1). Manning is the first quarterback to reach a Super Bowl under four different head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak) and would become the first quarterback to win the Vince Lombardi trophy with two franchises.\n\nCan I get a ticket?\n\nIf you have about $4,000 (\u00a32,800) spare. That will increase closer to the date.\n\nWho will commentate?\n\nCBS's Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. Both are not afraid to express their admiration of Manning.\n\nWhat happens at half-time?\n\nDuring the 30-minute break, the peculiarly popular Coldplay will rattle through their catalogue, joined by pint-sized pop crooner Bruno Mars. Oh, and Beyonce.\n\nBeyonce will join Coldplay and Bruno Mars to provide the entertainment during a 30-minute half time show\n\nWhich one's the referee?\n\nClete Blakeman leads the seven-man crew. He was the one who failed to flip the coin before overtime in the Divisional Round Arizona Cardinals Green Bay game.\n\nIt will be his first Super Bowl, but the appointment met the approval of NFL sage Peter King. 'I think Blakeman's a good ref. Good presence. Good control of game,' he tweeted.\n\nWhere are the Roman numerals?\n\nThey have been ditched for the first time since Super Bowl 4. They will be back next year for Super Bowl LI in Houston.\n\nHow much does an advert cost?\n\n$5 million (\u00a33.51m) for 30-second ad spot",

His key thing is, concentrate, stay in the moment. This is what he worked for.\"\n\nElway, the Broncos' general manager, retired after winning his second Super Bowl title in January 1999 at age 38.

He missed time his final year with a hamstring injury, and he finally decided his body just couldn't hold up any longer.\n\nOf course, winning his second consecutive title helped.\n\nManning cwould match Elway's ring total with a win Sunday against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMeet some of the wacky characters from Super Bowl Opening Night\n\n\"The bottom line is that you have to stay in the moment. The one thing you don't want to do is think about not playing while you are still playing,\" Elway said.\n\n\"At some point, you're not going to be able to play. So it's important to stay in the moment, enjoy what he is going through right now, the hard work that he's put in this year to get himself where he is now, hopefully win this last game. And then in the offseason he can sit down and figure out what he wants to do.\"\n\nContributing: Eric Prisbell\n\n***\n\nFollow Lindsay H.

                    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Musings, observations and the occasional insight from Super Bowl 50's media day...which was actually at night for the first time and far tamer than most previous editions of this annual hype-fest that I've attended...\n\n* Somewhere it is written that this year's Super Bowl has just one sentimental favorite, a certain pizza-shilling Denver quarterback whom the football nation (outside of the Carolinas) would love to see ride off into the sunset of retirement with an Elway-esque blaze of glory. But if Peyton Manning wins on Sunday against the favored 17-1 Panthers, then Wade Phillips wins, too. And that should give football fans a heaping double dose of feel-good stories to root for in the golden anniversary Super Bowl in Santa Clara.\n\nNFL Video Scenes, sights and sounds from Super Bowl 50 Media Night in San Jose by SI Staff 0 0 0 0 0 0 More I'm a sucker and always have been for long, interesting careers, and how they rise and fall, ebb and flow. I like figures who have survived and thrived, failed and re-invented themselves, but always keep coming back for more. And when it comes to Phillips, the Broncos' 68-year-old defensive coordinator and beacon of homespun humor, careers don't get a lot longer or more interesting.\n\nWhat a long, strange trip his has been. Phillips first coached in the NFL in 1976, 40 years ago, and he's held head coaching jobs with six clubs (three full-time gigs and three interim tenures) and been the defensive coordinator with a whopping eight organizations. This is his second go-around as Denver's DC, and his second shot at a Super Bowl ring, with his first opportunity producing the worst blowout in Super Bowl history: that 55-10 San Francisco drubbing of the Broncos in January 1990. Phillips has waited 26 years to get back to this stage, and it's why I couldn't wait to check in on Wade's World on Monday night at SAP Center, and to take in the wit and wisdom of the one and only Sonofbum, as he goes by on Twitter in an homage to his coaching father, the late, great Bum Phillips.\n\nIn 2014, Phillips was out of the NFL for the first time since 1975, and now he's in the Super Bowl, perhaps in a position to capture a career-capping, legacy-enriching win. He's one of the game's greatest defensive coordinators of the last 25 years, and his Broncos are ranked No. 1 in the league in almost every key category.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYou know what the Phillips Effect is? He's helped nine different teams to the playoffs in his first season on the job, as either a head coach or assistant, and everywhere he goes, winning and improvement follows. In his 33 seasons as either a head coach or coordinator in the NFL, his defenses have finished in the top 10 an impressive 18 times.\n\n\"Well, I've been real lucky,\" said Phillips, in that self-effacing, down-home style of his. \"Nine different times I've gone in and the first year we've been in the playoffs, and that just doesn't happen. I've helped every team improve wins wise, and I take pride in that. Six times as a coordinator and three times as a head coach we went to the playoffs in the first year.\"\n\nI love that Phillips is back on this stage, because living down a historic 45-point Super Bowl beating can't be an easy task. I asked him what his memories of that game were, you know, before the train named Joe Montana and the 49ers offense hit him that night in the New Orleans Superdome?\n\n\"The last one? Not good,\" he said. \"We played against one of the greatest teams of all time. So things didn't start out well, and as the guy said, the harder we tried, the behinder we got. That's about it.\"\n\nIf you're into omens, those 1989 49ers went 17-2 and ran roughshod over the rest of the NFL. Kind of the way the 17-1 Panthers have done so far this season. Which is why Phillips has reminded anyone who will listen this week that Carolina is the clear-cut favorite, which was the message when he tweeted out a picture of that retro cartoon hero, Underdog, over the weekend.\n\nBroncos pic.twitter.com/OuJfHE6i6P -- Wade Phillips (@sonofbum)\n\nJanuary 31, 2016\n\n\"I don't know about sentimental,\" Phillips said when I asked about his status as a fan favorite. \"The odds makers say we're not the favorite, which we like. I think our team thrives on that and our defense plays well under pressure. They seem to really respond under pressure.\"\n\nLike his famous father, Wade Phillips has a way with a story and can deliver a great line. I quizzed him on his favorite Bum-isms, and he quickly made his decision.\n\n\"The best one was with (Oilers running back) Earl Campbell, when Earl didn't make the mile,\" Phillips said. \"It was a mile test to see what kind of shape they were in, and Earl didn't make the mile and everybody ran up to Bum and said 'Bum, Bum what are you going to do? Earl didn't make the mile?' Bum said, 'Hell, if it's third and a mile, we won't give it to him.' And he said, 'But we're going to give it to him the rest of the time,' and we did.\"\n\nHow did Phillips spend his year away from the game? \"I got to be part of the media a little bit, and second guess, and I thought it was great,\" he quipped. Easy, isn't it, I replied. \"Yeah, it was,\" he said.\n\nManning might get most of the emotional energy aimed his way this week in the build-up to what is expected to be his final game. But don't forget about Phillips. We saw what his defense did to Tom Brady and the Patriots a little more than a week ago. The Cam Newton challenge is huge, and his season has set the standard in the NFL. But Phillips has a little mojo going for himself these days, and his ride to the Super Bowl has had more than its share of magic.\n\nBroncos defense playing at scary level as it prepares for Cam Newton\n\nSix-time Pro Bowl center Matt Birk raves about the Denver Broncos' defense as they prepare for the Carolina Panthers' more \"conventional\" offense.\n\n* Everyone is fixated about what Peyton Manning might do after this game, but Panthers defensive end Jared Allen is a 12-year vet making his first Super Bowl appearance, and who know if he'll return to the game or retire if Carolina wins it all?\n\n\"I don't know, I don't know the answer of that myself,\" Allen said, when I asked if a win on Sunday might influence his decision to walk away on top? \"I try to be present in the moment and right now I'm preparing to win Super Bowl 50. That's my only focus. After that I'll do what I'll always do, sit down and talk to my family and see how my body feels.\"\n\nAllen, receiver Jerricho Cotchery and defensive tackle Dwan Edwards all entered the NFL in 2004, and all three Panthers are playing in their first Super Bowl after that 12-season wait.\n\n\"Yep, '04 baby,\" Allen said of their draft class. \"It took a lot of patience. And all three of us lost in either the AFC or NFC title games at some point. So to get here, it's a special moment to share with those guys and just talk about the memories of how long it took for us to get here. It's something special.\"\n\nJust like the 2004 class, Allen said, tongue planted firmly in cheek.\n\n\"Oh, '04, I personally feel it's the best class ever,\" he said. \"I might be biased, I'm not sure.\"\n\nNFL Highlights from Peyton Manning's Super Bowl Media Day appearance by SI Wire 0 0 0 0 0 0 More * You can do a lot worse on Super Bowl media night than to spend time listening to the entertaining riffs coming from Broncos reserve defensive end Antonio Smith. He was on the 2008 Arizona team that narrowly lost Super Bowl XLIII to Pittsburgh, and seven years later he got going on how he wants no part of repeating the walk of shame that is the losing squad's departure from the field.\n\n\"You've got to walk through confetti, through hats getting passed out, kissing and hugging and congratulations,\" Smith said. \"You've got to go in the locker room as a loser and I'll never forget that, never.\"\n\nWhen that confetti shower starts, and it's falling, but not for you, it stings. And sticks.\n\n\"It definitely sticks,\" he said. \"I never want to ever feel it again. It's more you feel like burning the confetti up. A couple of us guys punched the confetti machine. If we wouldn't have got fined, we probably would have knocked it over.\"\n\nIs it like a party you're at, and they ask you to leave, I asked him?\n\n\"Worse,\" he said. \"It's like being in your own house and you ain't got control. Somebody came to your house, took your dinner, took your woman, took your kids and everything. All of it's mine. And says, 'Yeah, it's time for you to go.'\"\n\nNFL Here are all the goofy people at Super Bowl media day by Extra Mustard 0 0 0 0 0 0 More * No one wants to think that Denver is capable of laying another egg in the Super Bowl, like the Broncos did two years ago in New Jersey against Seattle. That 43-8 shellacking was such a letdown, and it kind of fit right into the Denver's history of anemic Super Bowl losses. The Broncos have been beaten five times by at least 17 points in a Super Bowl.\n\nDenver receiver Emmanuel Sanders wasn't yet a Bronco two years ago, and he spoke for the rest of America on Monday night when he recalled that horrid game:\n\n\"It was definitely hard to watch, because I'm a Peyton fan,\" Sanders said. \"The one thing is, you want to play in the Super Bowl, and if you do lose, you don't want to get blown out in front of the whole world. But here we are again, and this time hopefully we go out and win.\"\n\nYep, here they are again. Prepare your Super Bowl parties accordingly.\n\n* Panthers receivers coach Ricky Proehl is the only coach or player on Carolina who was also a part of the franchise's other Super Bowl team, the 2003 squad that lost a 32-29 heartbreaker to New England in Houston 12 years ago. He was a receiver on that team, and he'd have an unique appreciation for seeing that score settled with a win over Denver.\n\n\"That'd be special,\" he said. \"I would love for that to happen. Talk about vivid memories. The memories of that game are so strong. The disappointment of being so close. To be right there, and we felt like we had them on the ropes. It was one of the greatest games I've ever played in. It was unbelievable, what transpired in the second half.\"\n\nProehl's 2003 Panthers were underdogs, but this year's team is a favorite, with a caveat.\n\n\"We're the hunted, but it still feel like it's been a 'yeah, but' year,'' he said. \"We're good, our record's good, but we haven't played anybody, our schedule's weak, we've been lucky.' That's what we've heard all year.\"\n\n*\u200b MMQB: How John Elway built his Super Bowl-bound Broncos\n\n* John Elway won the Super Bowl with Denver at the end of the 1998 season, then retired, with back-to-back championships in his pocket. He pretty much knew he was done after that game, win or lose against Atlanta in the Super Bowl, but he's determined not to draw any parallels with the Manning situation this year, or rush No. 18's timetable for making a decision.\n\n\"I was 95 percent sure I was going to retire, just because my body was breaking down,\" Elway said. \"I missed four games that year, so I was 95 percent there. But still it took me a long time to get that last five percent.\"\n\nNFL Video Opponents of Cam Newton's critics easier to find than critics themselves by Michael Rosenberg 0 0 0 0 0 0 More Manning missed seven games this season after his foot issues surfaced at age 39, so it would seem the similarities are certainly there. But not for Elway.\n\n\"My stuff was different, and I think my style is different, so, no I don't think there's any parallels. The bottom line is Peyton Manning is going to make the best decision for him.\"\n\n* It didn't really seem right that Denver quarterback Brock Osweiler didn't get a podium Monday night. He started seven games for the Broncos and pretty much saved the season, going 5-2 when Manning was struggling mightily. And yet guys like Brandon Marshall, Owen Daniels and T.J. Ward had podiums.\n\nThere must be a secret Super Bowl rule that only one quarterback can be issued a Super Bowl media night podium, and that's why Osweiler was down there on the floor with the rest of the reserves, looking like he was just happy to be there. It was the Broncos who should be just happy he happened to be there this year.\n\n* Denver quarterbacks coach/passing game coordinator Greg Knapp spent nine years coaching for the 49ers, three more with the Raiders, and went to college at Sacramento State. So it's homecoming week for Knapp, and the idea of celebrating a Super Bowl win at Levi's Stadium has to be pretty delicious.\n\n\"This is where it started for me, so this is very exciting for me to get this opportunity and hopefully finish this season with a win,\" Knapp said. \"I've got a lot of ties to the bay area.\"\n\nKnapp said the Broncos quarterback room this season was as unlike any other he's ever been in, given the Manning-Osweiler split season dynamic.\n\nNFL Peyton Manning says Cam Newton should be MVP by SI Wire 0 0 0 0 0 0 More \"It was the most unique quarterback room I've ever experienced, because of who the two individuals were and where they are in their careers,\" Knapp said. \"What was really nice to see was the other guy was always helping out. It's not always smooth that way.\"\n\nAnd what if, heaven forbid, Manning can't finish the game on Sunday and Osweiler has to ride to the rescue again?\n\n\"If for some reason Brock has to play, yeah I feel extremely confident because he proved to his teammates and to us in those seven games he started, that he was ready for this challenge,\" Knapp said. \"He went 5-2 in those and won some high-profile games. So we're good with him.\"\n\nWouldn't that be a plot twist? If Manning's injury-interrupted season featured an injury-interrupted Super Bowl?\n\n* The team-first quote of the night came from Panthers strong safety Roman Harper, the former 2009 Saint who was explaining what those first few crazy minutes after a team wins the Super Bowl is like:\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Harper said. \"You'll be hugging guys you're not even that cool with.\"\n\nNot even that cool with. There are no I's in that sentence. At least not any verbal ones.\n\n* I dropped by a small scrum around Broncos tight end Vernon Davis briefly, just in time to hear him explain his near-invisible status since being acquired by Denver via a trade with San Francisco:\n\nMore Sports Video Super Bowl kickoff should be moved to 4:30 p.m. ET; SportsCenter changes by Richard Deitsch 0 0 0 0 0 0 More \"You can't quit, you can't give up,\" Davis said. \"For me, I can't do it. I'm going to keep on going. I don't care how bad people talk about me, what they've got to say. I don't care. I don't really care.\"\n\nMaybe he should start caring. Not caring certainly isn't helping him produce.\n\n* So, if the Panthers get a comfortable lead in the third quarter and half the lights go out at Levi's Stadium, Carolina tight end Ed Dickson is going to smell a rat.\n\n\"At that point, it might not be a conspiracy theory,\" said Dickson, the former 2012 Baltimore Raven, who lived through the Super Bowl blackout in the Superdome that season. \"I'll know it's an inside job then. It was really dark in there. It was like a second halftime. It was terrible.\"\n\nBut on the bright side, pun intended, Dickson would be the one Panther who could lead his team through their darkest hour.\n\n\"I might be the first one to say, 'I've been there before, I've been there before. So halfway through this, we're going to start stretching.'\"\n\n* Panthers center Ryan Kalil is an offensive lineman, and offensive linemen are usually known as the fat boys of an NFL team. But apparently not in Carolina. Because that's what they call running back Jonathan Stewart, who goes 5'10\", 235 pounds.\n\nStewart apparently is known for starting to fantasize about food from time to time in games.\n\n\"He gets hungry and that's what fat boys do,\" Kalil said. \"He starts smelling things that aren't there, and we keep snacks for him on the sidelines and keep him fed throughout the game, otherwise he gets really hungry.\"",

A look at a few of the highlights -- or lowlights:\n\nFashion show. A few of the Broncos' defensive stars used their spot on the podium Monday night to show off their bling. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, safety T.J. Ward and outside linebacker Von Miller were among the Broncos displaying an array of gold and platinum watches, necklaces, rings and bracelets.\n\n\"Oh, you talking about this little 'rollie,' man? You talking about this little $80,000 rollie,\" Talib said. \" This ain't nothing. I wear this every day.\"\n\nPhotos: Denver Broncos at Super Bowl 50 Opening Night\n\nTalib had so much jewelry that he loaned some to his defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips, who is not exactly known for wearing bling.\n\nPhillips is known for being a player's coach, and now he's the latest addition to the Broncos' chain gang.\n\n\"I had to do an interview with Wade, and he didn't want me to have all the ice on, so I put a couple chains on him,\" Talib said.\n\nWard said Talib probably had the most jewelry of anyone on the defense.\n\nUniform Broncos. There was no fox hat or flamboyant outfit on Von Miller. He, along with the rest of the Broncos, kept it uniform, with Nike Super Bowl 50 black jogging pants, white pullovers and black-and-gold football training shoes.\n\n\"I thought about a lot of stuff,\" Miller said, \"but this is a team-first event.\"\n\nSuperman Cam's pants. Miller weighed in on Cam Newton's Versace pants, which caused a social media firestorm Sunday.\n\n\"They were dope,\" Miller said. \"When you're Superman Cam, you can do whatever you want to do.\"\n\nPanther payday. Carolina has already collected on its postseason run. Sen. John McCain took the floor of the U.S. Senate Monday to offer a sheepish congratulations to the Panthers.\n\nThe former Republican presidential candidate from Arizona had to pay off Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina after the Arizona Cardinals were blasted by the Panthers in the NFC championship game. Tillis bought McCain a black-and-teal Panthers tie to wear during his floor appearance.\n\nMasked men. Carolina receiver Tedd Ginn and cornerback Josh Norman wore silver-and-teal Lucha Libre (wrestling) masks for their interviews, for no reason really, other than they can. ... A possibly drunk Broncos fan in a Miller jersey sneaked onto the floor and tried to greet Panthers players as they walked in. Heavy security detail quickly strong-armed him away. ... Miss Universe -- the real winner, not Miss Colombia, who was mistakenly declared the winner by Steve Harvey -- interviewed players for tabloid TV show. The interviews were short.",

                    "body": "SAN JOSE, CALIF. -- Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas stands at 6-foot-3, 229 pounds. He's chiseled, built like an elite No. 1 receiver. Paid like one, too.\n\nOn Monday's Super Bowl 50 media night, it might have felt like he shrank in size looking out at the hundreds of reporters firing questions his way.\n\nMost of the inquiries were about his mother, Katina Smith, who will be getting on her second-ever flight, to Santa Clara, Calif.. to see her son play Sunday. The usually reserved Thomas opened up about how he was worried for his mother being in a big city.\n\n\"The main thing I've been thinking about is having her out,\" he said. \"It's going to be so many people, and she's not used to it. Hopefully, nobody asks her too many questions or wants to get her in too much stuff.\"\n\nThomas said his mind has often wandered from football to his mom, who was recently released from prison. It has shown in his play with dropped passes.\n\nHis numbers -- 105 catches, 1,304 yards and six touchdowns -- were there this season, but Thomas and Broncos fans would agree that it has been a bit of a disappointing season.\n\n\"I have to go out and play better than I've been playing, for sure,\" said Thomas, who leads the Broncos with 11 dropped passes. \"It's some pressure there.\"\n\nIn the Broncos' two biggest games, victories over the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots in November and again in the AFC title game, Thomas combined for just three catches and 48 yards on 20 targets.\n\nSo it's only natural to ask: Will the real Demaryius Thomas please stand up?\n\n\"I don't need to talk to him about that. He knows it,\" said Rod Smith, the Broncos' all-time leading receiver and a close supporter of Thomas'. \"When the lights come on, that's when the stars shine the brightest.\"\n\nThomas was the only bright star in the Broncos' most recent trip to the big game in 2014. He set a Super Bowl record with 13 receptions for 118 yards and a touchdown in a 43-8 beatdown by Seattle.\n\nAfter the game, he got a call from his mother in prison. Her message: \"Keep your head up. You'll get another chance.\"\n\nHe didn't know he would.\n\n\"I didn't think we would be back two years later in the spot we're at now,\" Thomas said. \"It's a great feeling. Now, we have to get a win.\"\n\nBroncos coach Gary Kubiak said some of Thomas' struggles are based on defensive schemes aimed to stop him. He said New England coach Bill Belichick took Thomas out of contention during the AFC championship game.\n\nThe Broncos did. Quarterback Peyton Manning found tight end Owen Daniels twice in the back of the end zone in the first half. Denver's defense did enough in the second half to secure the victory.\n\nIn Super Bowl 50, however, the Broncos will need their star receiver to beat one-on-one coverage and make difficult catches -- and especially the easy ones. The Broncos can't afford to try to win another game in spite of Thomas.",

Manning came in, the Broncos rallied to win and clinch the top seed in the conference and the Broncos haven't looked back since then.\n\nOsweiler's not looking forward either. On Monday, he was asked about the prospect of becoming a starter in the 2016 season and said it wasn't on his radar with another game left on the schedule.\n\n\"I haven't even thought about that,\" Osweiler said. \"I am 100 percent focused on the Carolina Panthers defense and getting prepared for the Super Bowl on Sunday. That is something that we will look at in the future.\"\n\nOsweiler is set to become a free agent in March and it seems likely that he'll be at least a competitor for a starting spot come 2016. Denver would seem the likeliest place for that to happen, although Osweiler's probably not alone in tabling those thoughts until the Super Bowl is over.",

I hope it happens.\"\n\nThat kind of pressure -- although ramped up considerably for the Super Bowl -- is the way life is for kickers, from high school through the National Football League.\n\n\"It's kind of funny, but I'm just viewing this as any other game,\" Gano said. \"I've never been in a Super Bowl, but the NFC Championship Game (last week) felt like it. That was a pretty neat atmosphere, but it's just football.\"\n\nGano, who signed with the Panthers in 2012, has been generally reliable this season, making 33 of 39 field goals. He's been clutch, hitting a 43-yarder as time expired to beat the New York Giants, 38-35. He also made a 42-yarder against the Indianapolis Colts to tie the game during overtime, before connecting from 52 yards to win it 29-26.\n\n\"I have a tremendous amount of comfort in him; that's our guy,\" Panthers coach Ron Riverasaid.\n\nBroncos' bus in mishap:Practice may have been noncontact for the Broncos, but the ride back to the hotel was anything but.\n\nOne of the team buses was involved in a minor accident on a freeway while transporting players from their first workout at Stanford Stadium. Patrick Smyth, Broncos vice president of public relations, said that no one was injured in the incident\n\nOutside linebacker DeMarcus Waretweeted a photo of players standing alongside their bus. He posted: \"To keep the day interesting, we have a small wreck.\"",

His key thing is, concentrate, stay in the moment. This is what he worked for.\"\n\nElway, the Broncos' general manager, retired after winning his second Super Bowl title in January 1999 at age 38.

He missed time his final year with a hamstring injury, and he finally decided his body just couldn't hold up any longer.\n\nOf course, winning his second consecutive title helped.\n\nManning cwould match Elway's ring total with a win Sunday against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMeet some of the wacky characters from Super Bowl Opening Night\n\n\"The bottom line is that you have to stay in the moment. The one thing you don't want to do is think about not playing while you are still playing,\" Elway said.\n\n\"At some point, you're not going to be able to play. So it's important to stay in the moment, enjoy what he is going through right now, the hard work that he's put in this year to get himself where he is now, hopefully win this last game.

                    "body": "Two-hundred sixty-six down, one to go. The NFL season has come down to the Denver Broncos vs. the Carolina Panthers in the golden Super Bowl in the Golden State on Sunday, Feb. 7. (Which so happens to be the six-year anniversary of the Black and Gold Super Bowl.)\n\nIt's a sure-fire first-ballot Hall of Famer likely playing his final game against the current NFL MVP who, barring injury, will be one of the league's top stars for another decade and is in his first big dab, er, dance.\n\nIt should be an easy game to pick. Both teams have fabulous defenses, but the Carolina offense clearly has more to offer. The line continues to rise almost daily, and should settle in between 5.5 and 6.5 by game time. Not only does the betting public like the Panthers, but it seems as if big-money players do too.\n\nWhat's not to like? Other than one hiccup at the end of the regular season on the road at a division rival, Carolina has literally been unbeatable. Denver has been anything but. Other than last week, they have been very unimpressive for much of the latter part of the season, and it's clear Manning's right arm is on its last leg.\n\nAnd as I am prepared to type in that one last pick of the 2015 season, I go back to that first blog of the season when I wrote that Denver would win Super Bowl 50. Of course, it doesn't matter that I picked the Broncos to beat Philadelphia or that I said Carolina would finish 6-10 and last in the NFC South. (Or that I said the Rams would make the playoffs and the Redskins would finish 3-13.)\n\nThe important thing is that I knew in September who would win it all. (Insert smirk.) (And to think some of you said I wouldn't even mention this post again.)\n\nSo should I stick with the pick I made in September or wake up to reality and admit how wrong I was?\n\nLet me just go on record saying I hate the pick I am about to make. I have always been a fan of the Mannings, and I have a little extra-special place in my heart for Peyton, whom I first covered as a sophomore at Newman playing basketball with his brother, Cooper, in 1990.\n\nBut when trying to analyze a football game - especially the biggest one of the season - heart has no place. In reality, there's no question the Carolina Panthers are the best team in football, and Cam Newton is the league's best player. (Haters can stop reading now.)\n\nSo when it comes down to it, this just isn't a good matchup for the Broncos. That same defense that was able to put pressure on Tom Brady and his limited mobility with a three-man front will have to immensely change its philosophy against possibly the most mobile quarterback ever. (Yes, ever.)\n\nA couple of nicked-up Broncos in the secondary will have their work cut out for them, and their talented linebackers will have to spend more time spying on Newton.\n\nMeanwhile, I don't see the Denver running game being all that successful, either, and we know Manning can't throw the deep ball with precision.\n\nTo me, that adds up to a Carolina victory. And since the betting public is all over Carolina in this one, my heart hopes Peyton rides off into the sunset the same way his boss, John Elway, did a little less than two decades ago - with the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nBut my head knows better.\n\nThanks to everyone who has come along for the ride this season. It has been fun. Enjoy the game, y'all.\n\n* Spread was gathered from Odds Shark on Friday afternoon (Jan. 29).",

I make from scratch, straight outta the box, Lucky Charms,\" quarterback Cam Newton told one reporter.\n\nThe Panthers assumed the world's stage again for the first time in 12 years.

There's work to be done,\" tight end Greg Olsen said.\n\nRunning back Fozzy Whittaker echoed that, saying that what this team has is special and has helped keep them grounded through the week's excitement so far. \"It's hard to describe,\" he said.\n\nThe Panthers took the stage after the Broncos Monday. It was during the first portion of the night that Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning said Newton deserves the NFL's MVP recognition this year.\n\n\"He's played awesome football,\" Manning said of quarterback Newton. It's not easy to lead a team to 17 wins in a season, he added.\n\nBroncos head coach Gary Kubiak echoed Manning's sentiment about Newton, calling him a \"big-time weapon.\"",

During that span, they've averaged 39 points per game. Chew on that for a second -- 39 points per game in the NFL. That's incredible when you think about it.\n\nAt the NFL Honors Show that's televised Saturday night, Newton should find out he's been voted the league's Most Valuable Player. He already has been voted the All-Pro quarterback for the first time -- an honor that used to be rotated between Manning and New England's Tom Brady.\n\nNo matter what you think of Newton's touchdown and victory celebrations -- both have created controversy -- there's no denying he's been a spectacular player this season, by far the best of his five-year career.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 should be determined more by what Denver's defense can do to contain Newton more than how Manning will fare against Carolina's defense.\n\nRivera vs. Kubiak\n\nBoth teams have done exceptional coaching jobs this season.\n\nCarolina coach Ron Rivera, offensive coordinator Mike Shula and defensive coordinator Sean McDermott have been outstanding in helping orchestrate one of the greatest seasons in history.\n\nThe Panthers are trying to join the 1984San Francisco 49ers and 1985 Chicago Bears as the only 15-1 teams to win a Super Bowl. They're favored by 5 1/2 points for a reason.\n\nKubiak has led the Broncos to a 14-4 record. Manning has become more of a game manager than a devastating weapon. His strength in the playoffs has been to beat Pittsburgh and New England without throwing an interception.\n\nBecause of Manning and the possibility of Super Bowl 50 being his \"last rodeo,\" the Broncos are sentimental favorites.\n\nBut as Newton and the Panthers will tell you, there's no room for sentiment in football.",

                    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Even before their first official Super Bowl interviews, the Denver Broncos made news, of sorts, when the team bus was involved in a minor accident.\n\nA team spokesman released a statement that nobody on the squad was injured. The incident occurred at 1:47 p.m., after the Broncos' first practice at Stanford University in preparation for Sunday's Super Bowl 50 against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nThe wreck was on Highway 101 near Sunnyvale and involved a California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer, who had minor injuries.\n\nBroncos linebacker DeMarcus Ware may have been the first to report the incident, via Twitter.\n\n\"To keep the day interesting we had a small wreck. Looks like everyone is ok, though,\" he tweeted.\n\nLater, when interviewed at the SAP Center, Ware recalled the excitement.\n\n\"I was asleep on the bus,\" he said. \"All of a sudden I hear screeching tires.\"\n\nHe said the bus he was on was hit by the bus behind them and he was thankful nobody on the team was hurt.\n\nA CHP spokesperson said motorcycles provided a motorcade after the Broncos' practice when the buses came upon slow-moving traffic. A witness said a driver cut the motorcade off, causing three of the Broncos' buses to collide.\n\nThe third bus was disabled and seen parked on the side of a highway.\n\nThe CHP said the passengers on that bus were moved to one of the other buses and the team continued on to the hotel.\n\nQuarterback Peyton Manning said at the SAP Center, \"Kind of an exciting bus ride today. We got in a wreck on our bus, which kind of adds to the excitement of the season.\"\n\n--Pat Bowlen is one of the more respected owners in the NFL. He is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is not expected to be with the team for Super Bowl 50.\n\nBefore leaving for the Bay Area, club president and CEO Joe Ellis addressed the team about Bowlen.\n\nSaid head coach Gary Kubiak, \"We talk about Mr. B a lot. There are obviously a lot of older players in this organization that know him. There are people in this organization that know him extremely well and there are young kids who have probably never met him, maybe have not even seen him this year.\"\n\nKubiak said Ellis talked to the team about \"how he's doing and how he'd be very proud of this football team. It was a very good moment.\"\n\nCornerback Aqib Talib appreciated Ellis' words.\n\n\"He gave a nice little speech about Pat,\" Talib said. \"He was basically just saying what Pat would say to us with him not being able to join us and everything. He gave us a heartfelt speech.\"\n\n--Broncos safety T.J. Ward, a former star at prep powerhouse De La Salle High in nearby Concord, Calif., is back home this week.\n\nAlthough he was listed as questionable because of a left ankle injury,\n\nWard said there is no way he will miss the game.\n\n\"I'll be out there on Wednesday and preparing like any other week,\" Ward said Monday. \"I'll be ready. ...\n\n\"I can't believe I'm back in the Bay Area for Super Bowl 50. It's great to be back. Winning a Super Bowl, it would be a lifelong goal. But we have a job to do, so let's go.\"\n\nHe said the Broncos will feed off playing the underdog role against the Carolina Panthers.\n\n\"It's a challenge when the media or anybody else says you can't do something, and we've been thriving in that,\" Ward said.\n\n--Safety Shiloh Keo, who was sitting on his couch two months ago, will play for the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 on Sunday.\n\nKeo, who played college ball at Idaho and was drafted in the fifth round in 2011 by the Houston Texans, virtually was out of football since an injury early in 2014.\n\nWhen the Broncos were hit by injures in the defensive backfield, Keo's wife suggested he contact defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. Keo didn't have Phillips' phone number, so he contacted him on Twitter.\n\nIt has been a wild ride since.\n\n\"When I think about it, I get emotional,\" said Keo, who had a failed tryout with the Cincinnati Bengals in training camp this season.\n\n\"(The Broncos) believed in me, that's why they brought me here. They trust everybody in this locker room. I just hope I can continue to come through and bring home a championship.\"\n\nThings didn't start so well with the Broncos for Keo, who signed on Dec. 9 and was thrown into the lineup four days later against the Oakland Raiders.\n\nLate in that game, tight end Mychal Rivera beat him to catch a 16-yard touchdown pass from Derek Carr that gave the Raiders a 15-12 victory.\n\nHowever, in the final game of the regular season, Keo intercepted a pass from San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers. The turnover led to Ronnie Hillman's touchdown run that gave the Broncos a 27-20 victory and earned Denver the AFC's No. 1 playoff seed.\n\nIn the AFC Championship Game, Keo helped break up Tom Brady's two-point conversion pass intended for New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and then recovered the onside kick that clinched Denver's 20-18 victory and sent the Broncos to Super Bowl 50.\n\n--At the first press conference for Super Bowl 50, the Broncos and Panthers showed their mutual admiration.\n\nDenver quarterback Peyton Manning said Carolina's multi-talented signal-caller, Cam Newton, will be the face of the NFL the next decade.\n\nAnd Newton agreed, out of respect for Manning.\n\n\"Anything the sheriff says, you can probably ink it in gold,\" Newton said.\n\n--Broncos cornerback Chris Harris thinks Denver has Rodney Dangerfield syndrome.\n\n\"We beat the champs twice,\" cornerback Chris Harris, referring to the Broncos' victories over the New England Patriots, 30-24 in overtime on Nov. 29, then 20-18 in the AFC Championship Game.\n\n\"Nobody cared, I guess. ... I do feel like we deserve more credit.\"\n\nThe Broncos' linebackers are also taking a back seat to the Panthers' dynamic duo of Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis.\n\nVon Miller and DeMarcus Ware are the star outside backers for Denver. Carolina's big-play linebackers are on the inside.\n\n\"That's who they are talking about,\" Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall said about the Panthers' pair. \"We just gotta keep showing every Sunday and they'll be talking about us, too.\"\n\nMarshall did concede one thing: \"I personally think Luke Kuechly is the best linebacker in the league.\"\n\n--John Elway played in five Super Bowls (three defeats, then two wins) as a Denver quarterback, and this is his second Super Bowl as general manager. He is credited with building a defense that ranks No. 1 in the NFL through free agency and the draft -- Von Miller, in 2011, was the first pick after Elway gained control.\n\n\"I've seen it from both sides,\" Elway said. \"I stay true to my gut, to what I learned in locker rooms, what I learned playing the game, what I learned from my dad.\" His late father, Jack, coached at several schools, including San Jose State and Stanford, and finally was scout for the Broncos.\n\n--Denver coach Gary Kubiak was fired at the end of the 2013 season from his only previous head coaching job, at Houston. He spent the 2014 season as offensive coordinator with Baltimore, then was hired by Elway, who he used to back up at Denver\n\n\"First off, my years in Houston were good years building a franchise,\" said Kubiak. \"I'm proud of those years. We had a tough one the last (year). I think everybody understands that. I think one of the greatest things that happened to me in this business was getting a chance to go to Baltimore. It's a great organization. Being able to go to work for (Ravens head coach) John (Harbaugh), with (Ravens general manager and executive vice president) Ozzie (Newsome), with (Ravens owner) Steve Bisciotti, I know it was just a year for me, but it was a very powerful year for me as a coach.\"\n\n--The Sports Xchange's Howard Balzer, Eric Gilmore and Art Spander contributed to this notebook.\n\nRecommended",

                    "body": "Our hardcore cadre of Monday morning quarterbacks and football pollsters has several top words to deliver to Las Vegas odds-makers: Shove it. In convincing fashion, local pigskin experts or non-experts are defying the odds in rallying behind the Denver Broncos for Super Bowl 50. National sports pundits, television broadcasters, and so-called experts are predicting a victory by the Carolina Panthers by five and a half or so points. What are they thinking, or maybe they have smoked too much of Colorado's cannabis products?\n\nFor the Denver Broncos, it is their eighth appearance in the big game and their second within a two-year period. That's not a bad record. Carolina, meanwhile, is only making its second appearance in the spotlight game.\n\nBut still, the so-called experts are placing their bets on the Panthers due to their overall power and the fact that they nearly obtained a perfect mark going into the Super Bowl. In addition, they are riding the wave of probably the most intimidating quarterback in the last few years with Cam Newton. The Broncos are still regarded as one of the weakest number one seeds from the AFC to gain admission to the mighty contest.\n\nUnlike two years ago, the Broncos aren't quite the talk of the media, when sportswriters, broadcasters and bloggers were ready to hand Peyton Manning a ticket to immortality and were prepared to carve a Greek-like statute in his honor. This time, Peyton isn't even the story, with locals saying: It's the defense dummy.\n\nBut without further delays, here are some choice opinions from a few of our pigskin Monday morning quarterbacks.\n\nDave Paul, Teller County Commissioner and Hardcore Broncos Fan: The Denver Broncos will win by a score of 21-20. \"I am going to the Super Bowl game (in California) and will be cheering from the south stands just like I do at every home Broncos game. The stars are aligned. Defense wins championships.\" Dave knows his Broncos well, generating quite a track record of fan longevity with 18 years of possessing Broncos season tickets. In fact, he has only missed one game during this period to attend a family wedding (an acceptable excuse, but Dave still wishes he had attended that game). Paul even sees the game as a prelude to the political battles this year, with the Broncos assuming the role as Republicans.\n\nRalph Ostlund, Divide resident and former Olympic skier (until a TMJ staffer took him on a hill of doom): The Broncos will win by 27-24. \"Defense wins championships. But we need at least two big plays from our prized player (Peyton Manning). We are going against the best team in the league. We have had a great eight quarters (in the playoffs so far), and just need another four. Peyton needs to go out on top. It is like it is scripted for us.\" And like most local fans, Ralph maintains that the Broncos have learned the lessons of two years ago, and won't make the mistake of shooting off their mouths and getting way to overconfident. Plus, he notes they are a competitive team, setting a record for winning close games.\n\nJon De Vaux, Woodland Park Business Owner and Planning Commission Chairman: The Denver Broncos will win by 27-21. \"It's all about defense. I think the Broncos will score at least four field goals. If the defense comes through again and contains (Panthers quarterback) Cam Newton, the Broncos will definitely win. Otherwise, it's going to get ugly.\" Plus, he wants to see Peyton Manning go out in style, in a Super Bowl that everyone is predicting will be his last game as a player. \"I want them to win for Peyton.\"\n\nLorrie Worthey, Mayor of Green Mountain Falls: The Denver Broncos will win by 21-17. \"Our late son Jacob (who died in 2014 following a bout with leukemia) was a huge Denver Broncos fan. He will be watching over the Broncos during this game.\" Also, Lorrie, a staunch Broncos fan herself, cites the team's premiere defense.\n\nMaureen Manhart, Artist and Retired tTeacher: The Denver Broncos will win by a score of 27-24. \"The Broncos will win by the seat of their pants. They just have the momentum. And with Manning playing probably his last game, they will have much fan support.\"\n\nChris Hazlett, Cripple Creek Councilman and Restaurant/Bar Owner: The Denver Broncos will win by 30-26. \"People should bet on this score. They may win some money. The defense wins games like this, and the Broncos have a spectacular defense The defense will sack Cam Newton at least four times.\" Chris also believes the commercials will be outstanding for Super Bowl 50 and especially urges viewers to watch out for a new bizarre twist to the Budweiser spot. And for those looking for a place to watch the game, Chris says come to Ralf's in Cripple Creek. \"We have the craziest maniac Broncos fans anywhere. It will be quite a party.\"\n\nBob Volpe, Broncos Beat Writer for TMJ. The Denver Broncos will win by three. \"It's going to be a close game. If the defense can upset Cam Newton's timing, they can pull it off.\" In tracking the analysis of the game by major outlets, sports networks and key pundits, Bob has noticed a changing attitude in the last few days with the talk of a Carolina romp getting slightly subdued.\n\nJohn Jones????\n\nRick Langenberg, TMJ Ass. Publisher: The Denver Broncos will win by a sore of 24-21. \"Remember Carolina, the South lost the Civil War and Cam Newton will make the same mistakes that General Lee did at Gettysburg in thinking he can gamble on a fatal attack. Plus, it makes sense that the Broncos will win this time around, considering what they endured two years ago. This could be Peyton and John Elway's last hurrah.\"",

It was a very good moment.\"\n\nCornerback Aqib Talib appreciated Ellis' words.\n\n\"He gave a nice little speech about Pat,\" Talib said. \"He was basically just saying what Pat would say to us with him not being able to join us and everything. He gave us a heartfelt speech.\"\n\n--Broncos safety T.J. Ward, a former star at prep powerhouse De La Salle High in nearby Concord, Calif., is back home this week.\n\nAlthough he was listed as questionable because of a left ankle injury,\n\nWard said there is no way he will miss the game.\n\n\"I'll be out there on Wednesday and preparing like any other week,\" Ward said Monday. \"I'll be ready. ...\n\n\"I can't believe I'm back in the Bay Area for Super Bowl 50. It's great to be back. Winning a Super Bowl, it would be a lifelong goal. But we have a job to do, so let's go.\"\n\nHe said the Broncos will feed off playing the underdog role against the Carolina Panthers.\n\n\"It's a challenge when the media or anybody else says you can't do something, and we've been thriving in that,\" Ward said.\n\n--Safety Shiloh Keo, who was sitting on his couch two months ago, will play for the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 on Sunday.\n\nKeo, who played college ball at Idaho and was drafted in the fifth round in 2011 by the Houston Texans, virtually was out of football since an injury early in 2014.\n\nWhen the Broncos were hit by injures in the defensive backfield, Keo's wife suggested he contact defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. Keo didn't have Phillips' phone number, so he contacted him on Twitter.\n\nIt has been a wild ride since.\n\n\"When I think about it, I get emotional,\" said Keo, who had a failed tryout with the Cincinnati Bengals in training camp this season.\n\n\"(The Broncos) believed in me, that's why they brought me here. They trust everybody in this locker room. I just hope I can continue to come through and bring home a championship.\"\n\nThings didn't start so well with the Broncos for Keo, who signed on Dec. 9 and was thrown into the lineup four days later against the Oakland Raiders.\n\nLate in that game, tight end Mychal Rivera beat him to catch a 16-yard touchdown pass from Derek Carr that gave the Raiders a 15-12 victory.\n\nHowever, in the final game of the regular season, Keo intercepted a pass from San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers. The turnover led to Ronnie Hillman's touchdown run that gave the Broncos a 27-20 victory and earned Denver the AFC's No. 1 playoff seed.\n\nIn the AFC Championship Game, Keo helped break up Tom Brady's two-point conversion pass intended for New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and then recovered the onside kick that clinched Denver's 20-18 victory and sent the Broncos to Super Bowl 50.\n\n--At the first press conference for Super Bowl 50, the Broncos and Panthers showed their mutual admiration.\n\nDenver quarterback Peyton Manning said Carolina's multi-talented signal-caller, Cam Newton, will be the face of the NFL the next decade.\n\nAnd Newton agreed, out of respect for Manning.\n\n\"Anything the sheriff says, you can probably ink it in gold,\" Newton said.\n\n--Broncos cornerback Chris Harris thinks Denver has Rodney Dangerfield syndrome.\n\n\"We beat the champs twice,\" cornerback Chris Harris, referring to the Broncos' victories over the New England Patriots, 30-24 in overtime on Nov. 29, then 20-18 in the AFC Championship Game.\n\n\"Nobody cared, I guess. ... I do feel like we deserve more credit.\"\n\nThe Broncos' linebackers are also taking a back seat to the Panthers' dynamic duo of Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis.\n\nVon Miller and DeMarcus Ware are the star outside backers for Denver. Carolina's big-play linebackers are on the inside.\n\n\"That's who they are talking about,\" Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall said about the Panthers' pair. \"We just gotta keep showing every Sunday and they'll be talking about us, too.\"\n\nMarshall did concede one thing: \"I personally think Luke Kuechly is the best linebacker in the league.\"\n\n--The Sports Xchange's Howard Balzer and Eric Gilmore contributed to this notebook.\n\nRecommended",

The incident occurred at 1:47 p.m., after the Broncos' first practice at Stanford University in preparation for Sunday's Super Bowl 50 against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nThe wreck was on Highway 101 near Sunnyvale and involved a California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer, who had minor injuries.\n\nBroncos linebacker DeMarcus Ware may have been the first to report the incident, via Twitter.\n\n\"To keep the day interesting we had a small wreck. Looks like everyone is ok, though,\" he tweeted.\n\nLater, when interviewed at the SAP Center, Ware recalled the excitement.\n\n\"I was asleep on the bus,\" he said. \"All of a sudden I hear screeching tires.\"\n\nHe said the bus he was on was hit by the bus behind them and he was thankful nobody on the team was hurt.\n\nA CHP spokesperson said motorcycles provided a motorcade after the Broncos' practice when the buses came upon slow-moving traffic. A witness said a driver cut the motorcade off, causing three of the Broncos' buses to collide.\n\nThe third bus was disabled and seen parked on the side of a highway.\n\nThe CHP said the passengers on that bus were moved to one of the other buses and the team continued on to the hotel.\n\nQuarterback Peyton Manning said at the SAP Center, \"Kind of an exciting bus ride today. We got in a wreck on our bus, which kind of adds to the excitement of the season.\"\n\n--Pat Bowlen is one of the more respected owners in the NFL. He is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is not expected to be with the team for Super Bowl 50.\n\nBefore leaving for the Bay Area, club president and CEO Joe Ellis addressed the team about Bowlen.\n\nSaid head coach Gary Kubiak, \"We talk about Mr. B a lot. There are obviously a lot of older players in this organization that know him.

                    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The last image of Peyton Manning in the Super Bowl is the Broncos quarterback walking off the MetLife Stadium field with his head down surrounded by blue and green confetti after the Seahawks thrashed Denver 43-8 in Super Bowl 48.\n\nTwo years later, the Broncos are back and hoping to have a better showing against the Panthers in Super Bowl 50. It could not go much worse.\n\nThe Super Bowl has evolved from a game of blowouts that it was for much of its history to a lot of great games over the last 15 years. One of the exceptions came on that unseasonably warm day at The Meadowlands when Seattle overpowered the Broncos.\n\nThis Denver team looks much different. Yes, Manning is still at the controls of the offense, but he is no longer the focal point of the team. Vice president of football operations John Elway has remade the team in two years, putting the focus on defense.\n\nThe Broncos enter this game with just 20 holdovers (including players on injured reserve) from their previous Super Bowl team -- seven on offense and 13 on defense. Their defense was No. 1 in the NFL this season. The 39-year-old Manning has faded since that 2013 season when he threw 55 touchdown passes in the regular season. This year? He threw just nine.\n\n\"They're two different teams,\" Manning said Monday at the Super Bowl Opening Night. \"I think it's hard to make comparisons. Different players, different head coach. That was a great team to be a part of. I loved being on that team. ... We had an awesome year. We were the best team in the AFC and got beat by a better Seattle team in the Super Bowl. I give credit to them. This is a different team. I think to make comparisons doesn't make any sense. I'm very honored to be part of both of those teams.\"\n\nIn some ways, the transition is reminiscent of what the Broncos went through in Elway's final years as a player. When Elway and Denver won two Super Bowls to finish his career, it was behind running back Terrell Davis more than Elway.\n\n\"There always is a transition period, you know? Because unfortunately these great quarterbacks get older,\" Elway told USA Today. \"Really, what I was drawing off and have been drawing off, is my experience in my career as -- the older I got that, OK, when we won those two Super Bowls -- what was the formula? The formula was to play good defense, and offensively, it was about running the ball.\"\n\nElway lost three Super Bowls as a player before winning those two in his final years. He had to relive the nightmare of losing two years ago as an executive.\n\nThe game was never close as the Seahawks jumped out to a 36-0 lead in front of a rowdy crowd filled with Seahawks fans. Manning had two interceptions, one returned for a touchdown, lost a fumble and had a snap go over his head for a safety on the first play of the game.\n\nWide receiver Demaryius Thomas said the Broncos can use lessons from that game this week.\n\n\"I'm not saying we took anything for granted, but we have to worry about the task at hand,\" Thomas said. \"When Sunday comes, we have a job to do and we have to finish. During the week, don't be too uptight. Don't think about stuff too much. Just go about your routine. Make sure you're on time. Be you.\"\n\nTo many people, the Panthers bring back memories of that Seahawks team. They have a strong defense that can shut opponents down. With Manning looking nothing like the quarterback that won five NFL MVP Awards, the Broncos could fail to find the end zone. They will rely on their defense, led by linebacker Von Miller, who was unable to play two years ago after tearing an ACL two months earlier.\n\nAfter that Super Bowl, Elway knew the Broncos had to get tougher and rebuilt his defense. He signed DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib and T.J. Ware in a $110 million spending spree over 24 hours in March.\n\nThat defense has gotten the Broncos back to the Super Bowl, where Manning hopes to walk off in orange and blue confetti carrying a trophy this time.",

                    "title": "Tuesday NFL preview: Cam Newton, Peyton Manning in spotlight",
                    "body": "Thirty teams have finished their seasons, and there's only one game remaining: Super Bowl 50. David Newton and Jeff Legwold look ahead to what Tuesday has in store for the Panthers and Broncos.\n\nStoryline to watch: Ball control. Denver cornerback Aqib Talib said the key to stopping Carolina is stopping the run. Then he reminded how hard it is to stop quarterback Cam Newton. Talib just as easily could have said getting off the field was key. Carolina averaged 32:02 minutes of possession during the regular season and upped that to 36:08 in the playoffs. In their one loss, the Panthers held the ball a season-low 24:22. A big part of Carolina's dominance with time of possession is because it has the second-best run offense in the NFL. Talib was right. Denver has to stop that.\n\nInjuries to monitor: Outside linebacker Thomas Davis practiced for the first time on Monday with a protective device over the right forearm that he broke in the NFC Championship Game. He said he will go with that protection unless the trainers come up with a better solution. He didn't seem concerned, but it will be interesting to watch through the week whether soreness develops as Davis gets in more work.\n\nStat of the day: More than a dozen. That's how many times Newton was asked to dab during Monday night's media session. He dabbed exactly once, and it was a halfhearted attempt. If Newton dabs at least three times celebrating touchdowns on Sunday, the Panthers will have a good chance to win. -- David Newton\n\nStoryline to watch: Quarterback Peyton Manning said at Monday's media night that the seven starts he missed because of a left foot injury may have actually rested his arm, as well. Manning said his arm feels good as the Broncos prepare for the Super Bowl, and his teammates said he's throwing better than he has since training camp. And Panthers cornerback Josh Norman said he believes defenses make the mistake of underestimating Manning's arm strength these days but that he won't. \"Especially early in the game, he'll take a shot,\" Norman said.\n\nInjuries to monitor: The Broncos had a short workout at Stanford -- their practice home for the week -- and their only real major injury issue continues to be at safety. But T.J. Ward said on Monday night he expects to play, and the Broncos continue to have some optimism that Darian Stewart's right knee injury will improve through the week, as well. The Broncos did have a minor bus accident on the way back from Monday's practice, but there were no injuries.\n\nStat of the day: Manning has consistently talked about his patience as he has returned from his injury. Nothing may be a better indicator of that than the fact he has not thrown an interception in his past 9 \u00bd quarters of work since he entered the regular-season finale with just over eight minutes remaining in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the Panthers led the league in turnover margin this season at plus-20 and led the league in interceptions with 24. -- Jeff Legwold",

(AP) -- What happens when you put Peyton Manning, Miss Universe, an orange-and-blue leprechaun and 200 TV cameras into the same room?\n\nAnswer: Super Bowl Opening Night.\n\nThe NFL took a good idea gone surreal -- what used to be known as \"Media Day\" -- gave it a new name, added a live band and moved it to prime time Monday night to kick off Super Bowl week between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers.\n\nDenver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning answers questions during Opening Night for the NFL Super Bowl 50 football game Monday, Feb. 1, 2016, in San Jose, Calif. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)\n\nThis new and amped-up interview-fest came complete with a guy walking around inside an inflatable football and a newly choreographed players' introduction that involved all 60 players from each team coming out on a four-story-high catwalk.\n\n\"I had no idea that was a bridge we were standing on,\" Manning said.\n\nSuffice to say, the five-time MVP, who built a career on his impeccable preparation, couldn't have predicted a lot of what came his way on this night.\n\nWho would play him in a movie? \"Maybe a young Robert Redford,\" Manning said.\n\nAnother reporter -- or make that, person with a credential -- asked him to look into the camera and wish a Happy Chinese New Year to all his friends in that part of the world.\n\nAnd then, there was a long debate over whether Fat Tuesday and Mardi Gras are this week, or next? (Answer: Next week. We think.)\n\nAll of this thoughtfully brought to prime time by the NFL for the first time in the 50-year history of the Super Bowl.\n\nFor decades, Media Day was a Tuesday-morning affair -- set early in the day, early in the week, so as not to interrupt the teams' schedules too much and to give writers the rest of the week to craft the stories out of the questions they'd asked.\n\nBut this year, the NFL moved it to Monday night, where minor details like dress code, off-color banter and 8-year-olds asking football players questions after bedtime barely raise an eyebrow anymore.\n\nNFL spokesman Michael Signora described the scheduling change as one that allows \"more fans (to) experience what has grown to become a very unique, popular Super Bowl event.\"\n\nSurprising they didn't do this earlier. It's a nod to the reality that \"Media Day\" has long been a \"journalism-free zone\" -- one in which fans have willingly, for the last five years, paid money for tickets that allow them to sit in the stands and watch the hilarity unfold.\n\nSpeaking of which ...\n\nLate in the Broncos media session, Rocky the Leprechaun -- a regular at Broncos games over the years -- laid a dollar bill out on the blue carpeting of SAP Center and waited to see if someone would pick it up. Several minutes passed. Nobody did.\n\n\"Crazy to see that,\" he said.\n\nThe social experiment complete, he waited for a TV crew that needed him for a live shot.\n\nIn the meantime, he answered one question: What makes this week so great?\n\n\"There's a lot of happiness,\" he said. \"This world needs all the happiness it can get.\"\n\nOnly one team will be happy come Sunday night. The Panthers are favored. Manning is a sentimental favorite; at 39, many people expect he'll retire after this one.\n\nThat was one of the few actual news angles to cover during Denver's hour of fun behind the mic.\n\n\"I haven't made up my mind and I don't see myself knowing until the season's over,\" Manning said.\n\nAlso, the Broncos were involved in a minor bus crash after practice. There were no injuries. \"Just adds to the intrigue of what we've had all year,\" Manning said.\n\nBut enough of that serious stuff.\n\nMiss Universe, one of the 5,500 \"reporters\" with credentials for Super Bowl-week festivities, answered more questions than she asked. Most had to do with Steve Harvey. \"Yes, I am the real Miss Universe,\" she said, referencing Harvey's embarrassing gaffe during that prime-time show a few weeks back.\n\nHarvey was a no-show at this one.\n\nNo one missed him.\n\nFrom the costumes, to the beauty queens, to the guys dressed up like Sesame Street's Swedish Chef, this prime-time special had pretty much everything -- except for Donald Trump, who was waiting on caucus results in Iowa.\n\nAt one point, though, a reporter reminded Manning that Trump was picking the Broncos on Sunday because he knew Peyton, \"and he's a very, very good guy.\"\n\nWould Manning return the endorsement?\n\n\"I'm a football player,\" he said.\n\nMiss Universe Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach poses with Denver Broncos cornerback Kayvon Webster during Opening Night for the NFL Super Bowl 50 football game Monday, Feb. 1, 2016, in San Jose, Calif.

                    "body": "The Carolina Panthers' offense has been one of the best in the league this year but they will be going up against one of the best defenses in the league, the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers finished the year as the highest scoring offense, averaging 31.3 points per game. The postseason hasn't slowed this group down as the Panthers have score 31 points against the Seattle Seahawks and 49 points against the Arizona Cardinals. They have scored over 30 points in eight of the last nine games.\n\nThe Panthers' opponent in Super Bowl 50, the Denver Broncos, has one of the best defenses in the league this year. They rank near the top, if not the best, in a number of statistical categories.\n\nCategory Total Per Game Rank Total Yards 283.1 1st Passing Yards 199.6 1st Rushing Yards 83.6 3rd Points 18.5 4th Sacks 3.25 1st Takeaways 1.68 7th\n\nThe Broncos defense has done an excellent job of keeping teams off the scoreboard, holding opponents under 21 points in six out of the last seven games.\n\nThe biggest concern for the Panthers' has to be the pass rush of the Broncos with players like DeMarcus Ware, Von Miller and Shane Ray who have combined for 22.5 sacks in the regular season, which is more than the Buffalo Bills and Atlanta Falcons had all season.\n\nWhile, the Broncos have an excellent defense the Panthers' defense pose a number of problems ranging from the speed of Ted Ginn Jr. and Philly Brown, the receiving threat of Greg Olsen from the tight end position to the run game led by Jonathan Stewart.\n\nHowever, it is quarterback Cam Newton that is the biggest challenge and the Broncos' defensive coordinator Wade Phillips had high praise for him during Opening Night, according to this tweet from ESPN's Ed Werder.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Edwerderespn/status/694340886927245312\n\nNewton isn't a stranger to some of the best defenses though. The Seahawks finished the regular season first in points against and the Cardinals finished seventh and the Panthers scored 80 points against them. He averaged 248 passing yards and scored a total of five touchdowns to only one interceptions in the two postseason games.\n\nThe Super Bowl is meant to be the game pitting the best the league has to offer and it is clear that this is one matchup that will do just that.\n\nTwitter @BrandonCroce.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @PanthersonScout and like our page on Facebook.",

Some will be legally wagered, and plenty more will be illegally wagered.\n\nTotal it all up, and the American Gaming Association is predicting that Americans will wager a total of at least $4.2-billion on Super Bowl 50 between the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers.\n\nAccording to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, only $116-million was wagered legally on last year's big game between the Patriots and Seahawks-$3.4 million less than the amount of money legally placed on Super Bowl XLVIII between the Broncos and Seahawks. Take those numbers into consideration and it appears as though nearly 97% of the $4.2-billion placed on Sunday's game will be illegally wagered.\n\nAt the moment, the Panthers are 5.5-point favorites to beat the Broncos, and the Broncos are paying 2-to-1 to win the game straight-up. The over-under is set at 45 points.\n\nContact your local bookie to get your plays in before game time.",

                    "title": "Youth and Experience to Clash in Historic Super Bowl 50",
                    "body": "Super Bowl 50 takes place this coming Sunday, and it will feature a young, up-and-coming Carolina team with MVP hopeful quarterback Cam Newton going up against the Denver Broncos and the 39-year-old future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, who will likely be playing in the final game of his career and hoping to go out on top with a Lombardi trophy just like his boss, John Elway.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers went 15-1 this season, anchored by the best defense in the league with all-pro defenders Luke Kuechly at linebacker and Josh Norman at cornerback. Newton took the next step in his development this season and asserted himself as an elite quarterback, even with few weapons outside of tight end Greg Olsen. Newton threw for 35 touchdowns and ran for another 10. The Panthers offense is well-balanced and lethal; they rolled over the Arizona Cardinals' stout defense by a score of 49-14 in the NFC Championship game. They come into Super Bowl 50 with a chip on their shoulder, as many predicted that the team would fail to even make the playoffs let alone be the best team in the NFL.\n\nThe Denver Broncos went 12-4 and were the AFC's No. 1 seed, yet this was mainly due to their second-ranked defense in the league, and not the play of Manning, who threw 17 interceptions (second in the league) and only nine touchdowns in the worst statistical season of his career that resulted in him backing up Brock Osweiler when he returned from injury. Although he played just well enough to take down the defending champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship, he was a little more than a game manager. Against a team as well-rounded as Carolina, they are going to need Manning to step up and deliver one more time.\n\nThe Super Bowl has essentially become an unofficial holiday in America. In turn, many students on campus here at Ramapo are excited for the game. Nothing demonstrates this better than the fact that there is a six-hour pre-game show. It has become an event that transcends sports and is now ingrained in American culture, and everyone from the hardcore football fan to the casual observer is looking forward to the game.\n\nFreshman Aslan Peret is looking forward to the game, and although he will be rooting for the Broncos, he's not very optimistic.\n\n\"As much as I'd love to see Peyton win another Super Bowl, I think the Panthers are the better team,\" said Peret. \"No matter what happens, this is going to be a game people will remember for a long time.\"\n\nSophomore Ryan Bush is a huge football fan and could not be looking forward more to this game. \"You've got the legend in Peyton Manning going up against an up-and-coming superstar in Cam Newton,\" said Bush. \"This could be Peyton's last game and possibly Newton's first of many Super Bowl appearances; what's not to like?\"\n\nIn Super Bowl 50, we have the two best defenses in the league going up against radically different offenses run by quarterbacks with two different styles of play, who represent different eras.\n\nManning is a pro-style \"3-step drop back and pass\" quarterback, which NFL offenses have been built around for the last 50 years. Newton is a dual-threat quarterback, one that is mobile and can beat you on the ground but also has an outstanding arm. Manning, possibly the greatest quarterback to ever play the game, is playing in what is likely his final game, and Newton, who this season joined Manning as an elite quarterback, is playing in his first Super Bowl at the age of 26.\n\nIn many ways, this game is a passing of the torch between an established, future Hall of Fame quarterback to one that has all the talent to eventually be one as well. Both defenses are outstanding, meaning this game is likely to come down to which quarterback is going to be able to better lead their offense and make the critical plays in the second half of the game.",

Welcome to the Super Bowl opening night.\n\nMonday's event in the SAP Center in San Jose was the inaugural Super Bowl opening night, a prime-time version of the traditional Tuesday media day. It was also the first time the two teams officially addressed the media since arriving in the San Francisco area.\n\nFans were allowed to attend, and Michael David Smith of Pro Football Talk said thousands bought tickets at $27.50 each.\n\nFootball almost always takes a backseat during media day at the Super Bowl, and Monday's opening night was no different. Tom Pelissero of USA Today realized more than just human journalists were at the event:\n\nTwo puppets doing a press conference in Spanish.

The signal-caller also said he believes his counterpart, Cam Newton, is on his way to individual recognition, per NFL on ESPN: \"No doubt in my mind he'll be the MVP.\"\n\nThe Broncos quarterback also addressed the NFL's investigation into his link with HGH, per Troy Renck of the Denver Post: \"I know what they will find, a big fat nothing. I know rules and respect rules.\"\n\nManning's receivers also took the podium, and it is safe to say Demaryius Thomas won't be sticking around to watch the halftime show Sunday, per Jane McManus of ESPN.com:\n\n\"Demaryius what's your favorite Coldplay song?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Coldplay?

Talib also fielded a question about the local surroundings and said he would \"holla at one of the female guards for a couple years, have her get a little key or something and walk right out the building\" to escape Alcatraz, per Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald.\n\nHowever, Talib turned heads for more reasons than his Johnson and Alcatraz analysis, as Mike Sando of ESPN.com shared:\n\nAqib Talib's Rolex watch, which he called an \"$80,000 Rolley\" https://t.co/r0n5xzoo79 pic.twitter.com/oCWKm7o4Xw -- Mike Sando, ESPN.com (@SandoESPN)\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nTalib wasn't the only one with flashy jewelry in the Broncos secondary, per Sando:\n\nTJ Ward reveals that he and Aqib Talib use the same jeweler (\"Gabe\") and that his \"Jesus... https://t.co/bo3nqKol6P pic.twitter.com/FcZTljEUR9 -- Mike Sando, ESPN.com (@SandoESPN)\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nAs the Panthers began their session, Rovell explained why it was so crowded:\n\nPress credentialed for Super Bowl I: 338\n\nPress credentialed for Super Bowl 50: 5,000+ -- Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell)\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nIncluding people like this inflates those totals, per Nicki Jhabvala of the Denver Post:\n\nThis is when it gets awkward. #SB50 pic.twitter.com/6W8h14uUPn -- Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala)\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nBette Marston of Sports Illustrated passed along an image of the Panthers taking the stage:\n\nWho's ready for round two?

Kuechly addressed the opposition, per the NFL:\n\nWhat does @LukeKuechly think of the @Broncos' defense?\n\nHe likes what he sees. #SBOpeningNight #SB50 https://t.co/yVJWex5A74 -- NFL (@NFL)\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nWhile there were serious answers from some Panthers, there were also some interesting interviewers, as Bryan Strickland of Panthers.com shared:\n\nI have no answers. pic.twitter.com/o5KrnLodpi -- Bryan Strickland (@PanthersBryan)\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nJoe Person of the Charlotte Observer found another:\n\nMiss Universe interviews @bbersin10 and Andrew Norwell. pic.twitter.com/lJ7NkaVYdG -- Joe Person (@josephperson)\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nA young reporter stole the show, though, per the NFL:\n\nKid reporter: \"When I'm in the end zone, I do the dab just like you!\"\n\nCam: \"No you don't. What!?\" #SBOpeningNight https://t.co/wAJunZs0O4 -- NFL (@NFL)\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nNewton seemed to enjoy his interaction with the younger interviewer, but he left some thinking after this response to a question about his place in the sports hierarchy, per Lindsey Adler of BuzzFeed News:\n\nReporter: Are you the LeBron of the NFL?\n\nCam: \"Why can't LeBron be the Cam Newton of power forwards?\" -- Lindsey Adler (@Lahlahlindsey)\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nDespite the circus atmosphere Monday, the teams will now become more serious as they turn their attention toward the game. Newton said, \"We believe in ourselves, we believe in our coaching and in our preparation,\" per NFL on ESPN.\n\nWith Newton's talent leading the way, that may be all it takes to win the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nNow that the antics and interviews of Super Bowl opening night are in the rearview mirror, it is time for the football world to turn its attention toward the game.\n\nThere are plenty of storylines to follow, including the battle between one of the all-time greats in Manning and the likely MVP of the league in Newton. Manning is no longer the dominant force he once was, but all it would take is one throwback performance Sunday to lift the Lombardi Trophy. As for Newton, if he plays like he did all season, with 45 total touchdowns, Carolina will likely win the title.\n\nPerhaps the most important matchup is the one between the Panthers offense and the stifling Denver Broncos defense.\n\nCarolina scored a combined 80 points in its two postseason victories against the Arizona Cardinals and Seattle Seahawks, but Denver was first in the league in total defense and fourth in scoring defense this season. The Broncos stopped Tom Brady in the AFC Championship Game, but containing the dual-threat Newton will prove to be even more difficult with the Super Bowl hanging in the balance.\n\nMonday may have been a relaxing evening for the Denver defenders, but watching tape of Newton in preparation for Sunday's contest won't be.",

During six previous appearances, he's brought an Austrian flavor and costume while dressed up as Mozart, The Terminator (a.k.a. Arnold Schwarzenegger) and a yodeler in lederhosen.\n\nTurns out Austrians are growing increasingly fond of American football, according to Hajszan, who noted that while Peyton Manning makes for a splendid quarterback, he might be natural on the ski slopes.\n\n\"From the way he's walking, just from the look,'' Hajszan said, \"he has the right legs to ski well.''\n\n-----\n\nElsewhere in the throng was Denver sportscaster Arran Anderson. Viewers had implored him to burn the orange, blue and white argyle-patterned sports jacket he wore in honor of the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl XLVIII -- where the team got clobbered by the Seattle Seahawks 43-8.\n\nSo when Anderson showed up at Super Bowl media day Monday in an orange, blue and white argyle-patterned coat, he wanted to clarify something for Broncos' fans and viewers of KMZH-TV in Denver.\n\n\"Hey, this is a whole new jacket,'' Andersen told USA TODAY Sports. \"This has no negativity tied to what happened in Super Bowl XLVIII. We're talking about a clean slate.''\n\nBoth jackets were ordered through Loudmouth, the same company that supplies John Daly with head-turning golf outfits.\n\nOf his Broncos-colored blazer, Andersen said, \"I think it's visible from outer space to be honest with you.''\n\n------\n\nOn Super Bowl media day, there was runaway winner for oddest business card: \"Rocky The Colorado Leprechaun.''\n\nNot only did the famed Denver Broncos fan show up in his garish orange and blue regalia, but he also had a fistful of business cards.\n\n\"I've been Rocky The Leprechaun,'' said the man who identifies himself as only, you guessed it, Rocky The Leprechaun.\n\nBut his own website -- www.RockyTheLeprechaun.com -- blows his cover. His real name is Rocky Brougham, and his the leprechaun shtick started as St. Patrick's Day entertainment in 1976. Broughan says he's been to every Broncos home game since 1982 and attended each of their five Super Bowls.\n\nFor Rocky, Broncos football is serious business -- and he has the cards to prove it.\n\n-----\n\nOn an arena floor full of media badges -- and accompanying media members -- Hal Bonilla of the California Highway Patrol proudly wore around his a badge that distinguished him from all others.\n\nIt was a commemorative badge, featuring at the center an image of the Lombardi trophy, awarded to the Super Bowl champions. The badges are available to law enforcement members in northern California for $145, according to Sgt. Bonilla.\n\nBut his T-shirt was priceless. The design was split in half, Carolina Panthers on one side and Denver Broncos on the other side.\n\n\"Pretty much a household divided,'' he said, explaining that his wife is from Denver and he likes the Carolina Panthers. \"May the best team win.''\n\nPHOTOS: Best of Super Bowl Opening Night\n\nScenes from Super Bowl 50 Media Night Fullscreen Denver Broncos offensive guard Max Garcia (73) addresses members of the media during Super Bowl 50 Opening Night media day at SAP Center.

Today, they held practice at Stanford University before meeting with the media at the SAP Center in San Jose.\n\nNormally, media day would take place on the Tuesday before the big game. However, with this being Super Bowl 50, there was no doubt there would be a bigger stage for this one.\n\nThis media session can feature any and all questions that writers, reporters, bloggers, and such can think about. There is no knowing what kind of questions will be asked.\n\nOne question that I know in particular is Peyton Manning being asked how family dinners go in the Manning household while being handed a playbook.\n\nWith the various amount of questions, I have taken to Twitter and posted some of the best reactions and even some of the questions that were asked by the various media members.\n\nBrandon Marshall: \"We were embarrassed, [in SB 48] we're definitely looking forward to a better outcome.\" pic.twitter.com/t51cPx6iAZ\n\n-- Broncos SPORTalk (@SPORTalkBroncos) February 2, 2016\n\nShane Ray's rap battle.

                    "title": "Kartje: Broncos transform from offensive powerhouse to defensive juggernaut",
                    "body": "When the Denver Broncos last graced the Super Bowl stage just two years ago, they arrived in East Rutherford, N.J., with one of the most prolific offenses the NFL had ever seen.\n\nIn 13 of their 18 games before the Super Bowl, the 2013 Broncos put up at least 30 points. No team in the history of the league scored more over the course of a single season (606). No quarterback had ever thrown for as many yards (5,477) or touchdowns (55) as Peyton Manning, who was putting together the best campaign of his Hall of Fame career. Manning's dominance had been so complete that five of Denver's skill position players surpassed the 10-touchdown mark - yet another single-season record. And they showed no signs of slowing down. Two weeks earlier, in an AFC title game, Manning and his supporting cast picked the New England Patriots apart, to the tune of 400 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBy most measures, the Broncos offense appeared unstoppable.\n\nThat is, until the opening snap of the Super Bowl soared over Manning's head, and suddenly, at the worst possible time, it wasn't.\n\nIn fact, the Seattle Seahawks and their equally prolific \"Legion of Boom\" defense so thoroughly dominated the Broncos in an embarrassing, 43-8 Super Bowl blowout that day that John Elway, a Denver legend and the team's general manager, didn't just tinker with the direction of the franchise in the weeks to follow. He pulled a complete, fundamental 180.\n\nAfter an historically high-scoring season, the Hall of Fame quarterback and architect of the NFL's best offense in decades decided, instead, to build around his defense.\n\nTwo years later, one of the league's most impressive roster transformations ever is complete. The Broncos are back on the NFL's biggest stage this week, with barely any resemblance to the explosive, offensive team that fell apart in 2014. Only six starters from Super Bowl XLVIII will start in the same role Sunday against the Carolina Panthers, with Manning - coming off the worst and most likely last season of his NFL career - being one. Twenty-four months removed from trotting out an elite offense in New Jersey, the Broncos will take the field in Santa Clara with the second-lowest scoring offense to ever reach the league's biggest game.\n\nBut its defense, thanks to Elway's vision and aggressive moves in free agency, might be just as good as the Seattle unit Elway set out to emulate after Denver's Super Bowl embarrassment. This year's Broncos defense led the NFL in total yards allowed (283.1 per game), pass yards allowed (199.6 per game), yards per play allowed (4.4), fewest plays of 20 yards or more (46), and sacks (52). At every level, the Broncos defense is designed to wreak havoc on opposing quarterbacks, and in 2015, it did just that, better than anyone, by a significant margin.\n\nMany of the building blocks of that terrorizing defense were already in place when Elway set out to revamp his defense after the 2013 season, but only one starter, safety David Bruton, was inherited when he took the job in 2011. Von Miller, who has graded as a top-three edge rusher by Pro Football Focus in each of his five NFL seasons, was Elway's first draft pick as an executive that April. A few months later, before training camp, he signed undrafted free-agent cornerback Chris Harris Jr., who in a matter of three seasons, has become an All-Pro. In the 2012 draft, Elway added Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson, both of whom have been crucial up front this season.\n\nBut it was Elway's riskier moves that have paid the biggest dividends in Denver's defensive transformation. While conventional knowledge suggests that teams are better off building through the draft, Elway wasted no time raiding the 2014 free agent market for difference-makers on defense. In a single day, Elway shelled out $110 million in contracts to three defensive free agents - edge rusher DeMarcus Ware, cornerback Aqib Talib, and safety T.J. Ward. All three have been among the NFL's best at their positions since.\n\nElway's final master touch, however, came this offseason, when he hired an out-of-work Wade Phillips to helm the Denver defense. Phillips, with his typically dominant 3-4 defense installed, proceeded to create a monster.\n\nOn Jan. 24, in the Broncos' AFC championship victory over the Patriots, the defense that Elway had so aggressively built put together its piece de resistance. With its offense sputtering, the Broncos defense knocked down Patriots quarterback Tom Brady 18 times, despite blitzing on only 17.2 percent of New England's snaps - a season-low for the rush-happy Phillips. With few blitzes, the Broncos defense stifled the future Hall of Famer with an extra man in the secondary, while Denver's four-man rush of Miller, Ware, Wolfe and Jackson created pressure 48.7 percent of the time, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nTo beat the Panthers and soon-to-be league MVP Cam Newton, it'll take a similar Herculean effort. Unless Manning shows flashes of his 2013 self on Sunday's ride into the sunset, the Broncos will have no shot at outgunning the Panthers in a Super Bowl shootout. Denver's offense has scored 30 points just twice this season - and only once in regulation. Carolina's offense surpassed the 30-point mark eight times during the regular season and in each of its two playoff games.\n\nStopping Newton is a far different task than stopping a pocket-bound Brady. While Brady was knocked down 18 times by the Broncos, Newton has been sacked just 18 times all season.\n\nWhile under pressure, though, Newton, like most any other quarterback, has been far less effective, with an equal ratio of touchdowns (six) to interceptions. And no defense in the NFL is as capable of forcing Newton outside the pocket as the Broncos. If Denver can make Carolina one-dimensional, anything is possible.\n\nSo before joining the masses on the Panthers' bandwagon this week - they're 51/2-point favorites, after all - consider this: Since 1970, teams with the NFL's top defense are 9-2 in the Super Bowl.\n\nBut are the Broncos, with a prolific defense and pedestrian offense, good enough to continue the trend?\n\nElway, two years and hundreds of millions into Denver's roster transformation, is betting on it.",

There will be a million people out here.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Fans celebrated the Denver Broncos heading to Super Bowl 50\n\nAs the event went into full swing, Broncos cheerleaders signed autographs, and former players made predictions about the outcome of next week's Super Bowl. The rally also featured an appearance from Miles the Mascot.\n\nBut celebrating with devoted fans from the Mile High City was the motivation for several fans who showed up for the rally.\n\n\"I'm feeling that Mile High energy,\" said Jason Phelan, a 30-year-old salesman from Denver. \"I would just love to see them bring a trophy home. I think they deserve it, and we have a good chance.\"\n\nAbove the crowd chanting \"Go, Broncos\" Miguel Sifuentes, 37, waved a massive, homemade Broncos flag. He said the flag will travel with him to California this week when he cheers on the Broncos at the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We've got to do our thing in the stands, and they've got to do their thing on the field,\" he said.\n\nFans who aren't attending the game turned out at the rally to gear up for their own celebrations.\n\nTate Gilpin, a 28-year-old Denver resident, said he and his friends will unite in orange at their annual Super Bowl viewing party.\n\n\"The fans are going to have an impact,\" he said. \"If you're not a true fan, don't be in the room with me during the game.\"",

When that bridge comes, we'll cross it at that time.\"\n\nAZCENTRAL\n\nLive updates: Super Bowl 50 Opening Night\n\nOsweiler, a product of Arizona State, was asked how he could not let his mind wander to events beyond Sunday's Super Bowl against the Panthers.\n\n\"I can't control it,\" Osweiler said. \"My college coordinator (Noel Mazzone) told me my sophomore year in college, 'Brock, only worry about the things you can control.'\n\n\"And I can't control whether Peyton keeps playing football or he doesn't. So I'm not going to think about it. I'm not going to worry about it. I'm going to show up and do my job to the best of my abilities every day, every week.\"\n\nAZCENTRAL\n\nArizona Cardinals will be fine, CBS' NFL experts say\n\nA second-round pick by the Broncos in 2012, Osweiler's first NFL start came this year when Manning suffered a foot injury. The Broncos went 5-2 in games Osweiler started, but coach Gary Kubiak went back to Manning for the playoffs.\n\n\"When that situation did take place, I went home and talked to my wife,\" Osweiler said. \"My biggest thing during that couple weeks when that was going on, I just wanted to be the best teammate I could be.\n\n\"I think that's what makes this whole football team special. We all care about each other. As long as we're winning football games, I'm happy.\"\n\nDenver Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (88) addresses members of the media during Super Bowl 50 Opening Night media day at SAP Center.

His key thing is, concentrate, stay in the moment. This is what he worked for.\"\n\nElway, the Broncos' general manager, retired after winning his second Super Bowl title in January 1999 at age 38. But he seems reticent to offer his quarterback too much advice ahead of what could be Manning's final game.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPeyton Manning remains mum on retirement, backs Cam for MVP\n\nManning, who will turn 40 in March, missed six and a half games with a foot injury and had the worst statistical seasons of his career, including 17 interceptions in nine regular-season starts.\n\nFor Elway, the retirement decision 17 years ago was mostly a matter of health. He missed time his final year with a hamstring injury, and he finally decided his body just couldn't hold up any longer.\n\nOf course, winning his second consecutive title helped.\n\nManning cwould match Elway's ring total with a win Sunday against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSportscasters' outrageous outfits ramp up media day wackiness\n\n\"The bottom line is that you have to stay in the moment. The one thing you don't want to do is think about not playing while you are still playing,\" Elway said.\n\n\"At some point, you're not going to be able to play. So it's important to stay in the moment, enjoy what he is going through right now, the hard work that he's put in this year to get himself where he is now, hopefully win this last game. And then in the offseason he can sit down and figure out what he wants to do.\"\n\nContributing: Eric Prisbell\n\n***\n\nFollow Lindsay H.

He might be the best player in the league,\" Broncos linebacker Von Miller said of Newton. \"Cam is a super tough player to take down, he controls that whole offense. As Cam goes, that offense goes.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Best of Super Bowl Opening Night | Newton's dances\n\nNewton will likely be the NFL's MVP after leading the Panthers to a 17-1 record as the league's highest-scoring team. Newton threw for 3,837 yards with 35 touchdowns and ran for 636 yards and 10 scores during the regular season.\n\nThe Broncos had the NFL's No. 1 defense and led the league in sacks. While Newton was sacked 33 times during the regular season, the Broncos know bringing him down Sunday won't be easy.\n\n\"If I sack him, that counts as two because he's just that hard to take down,\" Denver's 6-4, 258-pound pass rusher DeMarcus Ware said of the 6-5, 245-pound quarterback. \"He's a phenomenal player. He's as big as me. He's a beast.\"\n\nEven Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning lauded the Panthers quarterback, saying Newton's \"passion and enthusiasm for the game are great football.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt in my mind he's going to be the MVP,\" Manning said. \"What he's done in a short time as an NFL quarterback, he's been awesome. He's been a great passer, a great runner, a great leader. You don't go 17-1 as a starting quarterback without being awesome.\"\n\nMORE: Why Manning should thank Newton | Newton vs. hypocrisy\n\nThe last time the Broncos were in the Super Bowl, they were the NFL's highest scoring team and were shut down by the league's No. 1 defense as the Seahawks rolled to a 43-8 victory two years ago. Miller didn't play in that game and obviously is hoping for a different result Sunday.\n\nAs for Newton's loud, striped gold pants he wore Sunday, Miller doesn't have an issue with them.\n\n\"When you're Superman, you can wear whatever you want,\" he said.\n\nMiller and the Broncos might want to bring some Kryptonite to Levi's Stadium on Sunday.",

There's no way a 68-year-old is saying \"drippin\" without some 20 year old whispering it in his ear.\n\nNonetheless, another classic from \"Son Of Bum.\"\n\nAs we wrote on Monday, Phillips is one of the three Broncos you need to be keeping your eyes on all week, and he's quickly proving why.\n\nLet's hope all the Broncos are rocking the ice and \"drippin\" Sunday night!",

Doesn't mean it will be it,\" Manning said.\n\nManning added that he was just trying to take in the moment as he entered his fourth Super Bowl in pursuit of his second title.\n\n\"Seeing other people enjoying the moment reminds me I need to be enjoying this as well,\" Manning said.\n\nThe five-time MVP also backed Super Bowl opponent and Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton for this year's award.\n\n\"He's just had this incredible year,\" Manning said. \"No doubt in my mind he'll win the MVP. He's been awesome - that's the best word I can think of.\"\n\nManning also held firm on his stance regarding an Al Jazeera America report alleging HGH shipments were delivered to his house in his wife's name, an accusation the NFL is currently investigating. He called the report \"a complete farce, a fabrication.\"\n\n\"Like I said in December, I welcome it,\" Manning said of the investigation. \"I respect the rules of the game. They're very important to me. And I welcome it, because I know what they're going to find: a big, fat no.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Best of Super Bowl Media Night\n\nScenes from Super Bowl 50 Media Night Fullscreen Proplayersinsiders.com reporter Theresa Villano takes a selfie with the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl 50 Opening Night media day at SAP Center.

                    "title": "What to watch for as Super Bowl week kicks off",
                    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The Super Bowl is back in California for the first time in 13 years, and the 50th battle for the Lombardi Trophy offers a dynamic matchup between the Panthers and Broncos.\n\nBoth teams arrived last night, and the week of festivities begin tonight with the first primetime edition of Super Bowl Media Day.\n\nAs always, there is no shortage of storylines in the lead-up to Sunday's game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nThe Panthers and Broncos play an old-school brand of physical, intimidating football, and Panthers quarterback Cam Newton's rapid ascension yields a new-school twist.\n\nNewton will almost certainly win the MVP, which means he'll have a chance to join Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, Emmitt Smith, Steve Young and Kurt Warner as the seventh player in history to double up as the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nFrom start to (possibly) finish, this has been the year of Newton and the Panthers, and the quarterback has legitimized himself as one of the most dominant offensive forces in the league. That's been made all the more impressive by the relative lack of big-name weapons around him, as wide receiver Steve Smith left in 2014, running back DeAngelo Williams departed in 2015 and wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin tore his ACL in August.\n\nBut Newton led the Panthers to 14 consecutive regular-season wins and 17 victories in 18 games to this point. And he has completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 3,837 yards, 35 touchdowns and just 10 interceptions while running 132 times for 636 yards and 10 scores.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 245-pounder is a menace on third down, too, with 13 touchdowns (second most in the NFL) and a league-high 25 conversions on the ground (more than twice as many as all but four players).\n\nHowever, Newton's on-field brilliance has been met with widespread criticism from the \"what are we supposed to tell the children?\" crowd, who can't understand that football is meant to also be fun.\n\nGranted, the dab is insufferable, but there isn't a defense on the planet that can make him stop. Unfortunately, during a week like this, that storyline will get extra airtime from the entertainment media.\n\nOld man Peyton\n\nBroncos quarterback Peyton Manning told Bill Belichick after the AFC Championship Game this might be his \"last rodeo,\" so with a win, he has a chance to go out on top like his boss, John Elway.\n\nAt this point, Manning's arm strength resembles Archie's more than his own, but his supporting cast, both offensively and defensively, is about as strong as it's ever been in his 18th season. Manning's Super Bowl history is checkered, but he could join his brother, Eli, and become the 12th quarterback to win a pair of Super Bowls.\n\nBut in Manning's two losses, he threw a pick-6 on a decisive drive against the Saints in 2009 and was embarrassed by the Seahawks in 2013, which was tied for the third most lopsided Super Bowl in history. Elway knows that feeling, too.\n\nOh, and there's the HGH storyline. The NFL has announced it's investigating Manning's alleged receipt of an HGH delivery in 2011, while the 39-year-old has denied ever using the PED in the fallout of the Al Jazeera report. That subplot has been largely swept under the rug over the last month, but Manning can't hide from the allegations during four consecutive days at a podium this week.\n\nRoger that\n\nSome 367 days ago, Roger Goodell claimed that he's available to the media every day of the year. In a conservative estimate, Goodell has fallen short of that by about 350 interviews, but he gets his next chance Friday to stand before the masses.\n\nDeflategate will remain on the table, now and forever, as well as the league's apparent investigation into Manning's wife's HGH shipments. The \"Concussion\" movie will likely be addressed. It also seems fair to inquire about Greg Hardy's tone deaf remarks in the aftermath of his suspension.\n\nBut remember last year? Goodell was asked 28 questions, but only one Boston media member was called upon when droves wanted answers about Deflategate. Goodell's representatives instead doled out microphones to those who asked questions about the NFL's improved technology and the carrot it continues to dangle in front of the London audience. And this was when Goodell wasn't yucking it up with a junior reporter about their Play 60 mission.\n\nSo yeah, everyone would love to hear Goodell give genuine, informative responses about the league's shortcomings, but the reality is he'll probably spent the better portion of 45 minutes talking about how he and the league brought football back into the Los Angeles market.\n\nAnd don't forget the game\n\nAh yes, the game. The Panthers and Broncos try to kick in their opponents' organs for 60 minutes, and the Panthers' offense likes to get nasty, too. If you like to watch teams line up with the intention of beating the heck out of one another, this is the week for you.\n\nThis is a pretty cool week for 33-year-old pass rushers Jared Allen (Panthers) and Demarcus Ware (Broncos), who are making their first trips to the Super Bowl.\n\nKeep an eye on a couple local angles. Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly, a Boston College product, signed a five-year, $62 million contract extension this season. Kuechly, 24, is younger than both Dont'a Hightower, 25, and Jamie Collins, 26, but they'll be arguing for contracts in that range in the next year.\n\nSpeaking of money, Panthers cornerback Josh Norman may very well be the best at the position, and he's scheduled to be a free agent in March. Norman and Broncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders will have the best battle on the perimeter in the game.\n\nBroncos cornerback Aqib Talib spent a year and a half with the Patriots. Former Pats second-round pick Ras-I Dowling could potentially play the role of Talib on the Panthers' practice squad.",

Take your eyes off Twitter for one moment, and you'll miss a firestorm of storylines. Forget to tune into SportsCenter, and a heartbreaking story of perseverance and triumph may slip past your radar.\n\nAs fans, especially as Broncos fans, this whole week is a culmination of years' worth of support and dedication. It's a celebration, really. And the actual Super Bowl is the gigantic, franchise-defining cherry on top of our Broncos cake.\n\nSo enjoy every bit of this week, because moments like these don't come around often.\n\nAnd with that said, here are three Broncos you need to be keeping an especially close eye on all week.\n\nPeyton Manning may not be the most important person on this Denver Broncos team, but this is Peyton Manning's Super Bowl. Like it or not, this is a legacy-defining moment for one of the game's greatest quarterbacks. Even if he throws for 100 yards and an interception, he will be dubbed a hero in a Broncos win.\n\nPlus, more likely than not, this will be the last game No. 18 every plays in the NFL; that's some heavy stuff.\n\nThe media will be flocking around The Sheriff all week, and I'm sure he'll have plenty to say, even if it is a little shielded. As we've seen over the last few months, but especially over the last few weeks, Manning is more emotional than ever. The fact that he's walking around Sports Authority field with his family, taking pictures and enjoying the moment tells us something: He's very cognizant of the moment he's in.\n\nIf this is Manning's last ride, he's not going to let it go to waste. Neither will the media.",

                    "body": "With Super Bowl week finally upon us, the big question bettors want to know is, when is the right time to wager on the favored Carolina Panthers (17-1) or the underdog Denver Broncos (14-4)?\n\nCarolina had hit as high as a six-point favorite in the big game at sportsbooks monitored by Odds Shark as of late Monday. Some books opened the Panthers as 3.5-point chalk, but that number quickly disappeared after they steamrolled the Arizona Cardinals 49-15 in the NFC Championship Game.\n\nEven though the best time to wager on Carolina has more than likely passed, Denver backers are still patiently waiting for the perfect opportunity to bet on the underdog.\n\nWhether or not the Super Bowl 50 line hits the magic number of seven points remains to be seen, with much of the betting action in Las Vegas taking place late in the week.\n\nGetting six points with the Broncos might be as good as it gets, and many books still have them at that number.\n\nThis is also true with the moneyline, which involves simply wagering on the team you think will win Super Bowl 50. The best +200 price (bet $100 to win $200) you can get on Denver right now will probably not last much longer either unless money on the Panthers pours in to push the point spread to seven.\n\nHowever, bettors who like the under to cash in what they think will be a defensive battle might want to wait as long as possible. The total opened as low as 44 points and is now as high as 46 points, and the public generally wagers on the over.\n\nThe Broncos bring the league's top-ranked defense into Super Bowl 50, and their best chance to win may be in a low-scoring game. Carolina's lone setback of the season was a 20-13 road loss to the Atlanta Falcons in Week 16. In the past five games for the Panthers, that is the only under that has cashed in.\n\nTaking Denver and the under together will be a popular corresponding parlay for many, as will Carolina and the over. But Peyton Manning's ability to keep the Broncos competitive in a high-scoring affair and possibly pull off the upset in what could be his final game before he retires would spoil both possibilities.",

                    "body": "Opposites will attract when the Carolina Panthers take on the Denver Broncos on Sunday in Super Bowl 50 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThe Panthers, who finished the regular season 15-1, are led by energetic quarterback Cam Newton, who in his fifth NFL season is headed to his first Super Bowl. The Broncos, meanwhile, are led by veteran quarterback Peyton Manning, who many believe will be playing his final NFL game.\n\nYou can watch Super Bowl 50 live on CTV at 6:30pm et/3:30 pt.\n\nThe two teams took very different paths along the way, but both managed to reach the Big Game.\n\nThe Panthers raced through the regular season, reaching Week 16 before finally suffering their first loss of the season in a 20-13 defeat at the hands of the already eliminated Atlanta Falcons. Newton received the lion's share of the credit for the team's record, and deservedly so, with 45 total touchdowns on the season.\n\nLike the Panthers, the Broncos jumped out to an undefeated 7-0 start before suffering their first defeat in Week 9. However, the Broncos strong start seemingly came in spite of their star quarterback and not because of him. Manning threw just seven touchdowns in the team's first seven wins and tossed 11 interceptions. A low-point came when the Broncos needed overtime to defeat the Cleveland Browns in Week 6 as Manning turned the ball over three times. The Broncos dominant defence, however, consistently came to rescue, allowing just 16 points per game through their first seven contests. When Manning suffered a foot injury in a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 10, Brock Osweiler took over at quarterback and kept the Broncos on the playoff path with a 4-2 record. Yet, as Osweiler struggled to move the offence in Week 17 against the San Diego Chargers, it was Manning who was called in to help the team to victory and clinch the AFC's No. 1 seed.\n\nIn the postseason, the Panthers followed their regular season script of domination. The team raced to a 31-point halftime lead on the twice-defending NFC champion Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional Round before holding on for a seven-point win. One week later, in the conference championship against the Arizona Cardinals, the Panthers took a 24-7 lead into half, but this time didn't let up en route to a 49-15 blowout.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Broncos continued to advance in their typical nail-biting fashion. The team trailed 13-12 in the fourth quarter of the Divisional Round against the driving Pittsburgh Steelers before a fumble recovery turned the tides and allowed them to pick up a 23-16 win. Facing Manning's archrival Tom Brady in the AFC Championship, the Broncos narrowly avoided overtime thanks to a failed two-point conversion attempt by the Patriots with 12 seconds left on the game clock.\n\nNow, the two teams' respective paths have led them to game's biggest stage with Manning out to cement his legacy, and Newton hoping to create his.",

                    "title": "Super Bowl 50: How the Broncos were built through the NFL Draft - CBSSports.com",
                    "body": "Since Peyton Manning arrived in Denver four years ago, the Broncos have consistently been a Super Bowl contender, including a trip to the big game two years ago in Super Bowl XLVIII against the Seattle Seahawks. But unlike that Super Bowl run, which was mainly orchestrated by Manning and a juggernaut offense, the Broncos are the 2015 AFC champions largely due to a suffocating defense and roster built with balance.\n\nThe Broncos have been very active in free agency, filling out the roster with cornerstone players like defensive end DeMarcus Ware, wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders and cornerback Aqib Talib. But the NFL Draft has been a critical step to the construction of the AFC champs with 22 players on the roster that Denver drafted (two more than the Panthers), including five first-round picks. Team-building is a delicate balance between free agents and draft picks and executive vice president/general manager and Broncos legend John Elway has walked the fine line well.\n\nAnother key difference in this year's Broncos team is the coaching staff as Denver and former head coach John Fox mutually agreed to part ways after last season. To create better cohesion between the coaching staff and front office, Elway hired Gary Kubiak as head coach, another familiar face as he previously served as backup quarterback (1983-91) and offensive coordinator (1995-2005) in Denver.\n\nFollowing the disastrous Josh McDaniels era, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen added Elway to the front office in 2011. The move was met with skepticism as some saw the hire as a public relations move for the fans. However, it became clear very quickly that Elway was more than just a spokesman or token figure head, the Broncos were going to be built with a blueprint designed by the quarterback who won the franchise its only two Super Bowls.\n\nOnce Elway took over the day-to-day operations, he didn't insist on a complete overhaul of the player personnel department. Instead, he kept most of the football operations staff intact, adding several experienced decision-makers from the outside, including Tom Heckert, former general manager of the Cleveland Browns.\n\nTwo years ago, the Broncos advanced to the Super Bowl with a record-breaking offense led by Manning, but it was no match for the Seahawks' No. 1-ranked defense as Seattle dominated Denver in Super Bowl XLVIII, 43-8. Having a future Hall of Fame quarterback at the helm was obviously important, but, as the old adage says, defense wins championships. A few weeks after that loss, Elway committed more than $100 million in free agency to Talib, Ware and T.J. Ward and continued to focus on defensive prospects in the draft.\n\nYes, Elway is a former quarterback and offensive thinker by trade, but since he was hired as a member of the Broncos' front office in 2011, Denver has drafted a defensive player with their first pick in the draft each of the last five years and eight defensive players on the roster are former top-40 draft picks. Elway and his staff have also found several late-round or undrafted gems, including cornerback Chris Harris, who has made the Pro Bowl the last two years.\n\nAnd the final piece to the puzzle was Wade Phillips, who was hired as defensive coordinator prior to the 2015 season. The year the Broncos lost to the Seahawks in the Super Bowl, the Denver defense finished 19th in the NFL. But that ranking improved to third in 2014 and No. 1 in 2015 under Phillips, leading the league in total yards allowed (283.1), sacks (52), forced fumbles (25) and defensive scores (four).\n\nThe core of the Broncos roster is a balance of home-grown draft picks, wise free agent signings and a few undrafted discoveries.\n\nManning, Ware and Talib were all signed to lucrative free agent deals on Elway's watch, along with several other important yet under-the-radar additions like linebacker Brandon Marshall and guard Louis Vasquez (both chosen as Pro Bowl alternates in 2015). Wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and offensive tackle Ryan Clady are the two core players who were on the roster prior to Elway, although Clady missed all of the 2015 seasons due to a torn ACL.\n\nThrough the draft, the Broncos have used high draft picks to find core players, including Von Miller (No. 2 overall, 2011), Derek Wolfe (No. 36 overall, 2012) and Sylvester Williams (No. 28, 2013) in the defensive front-seven. And the franchise has hit on several late round or undrafted players in the bargain bin like Harris (undrafted), Malik Jackson (No. 137 overall, 2012) and Danny Trevathan (No. 188 overall, 2012).\n\nA player who may or may not be the future of the franchise at quarterback, Brock Osweiler proved to be a valuable member of the Broncos this season, recording a 5-2 record as a starter while Manning was out with injuries. Osweiler was drafted in the second round of the 2012 NFL Draft and will be a free agent after the Super Bowl.\n\nDenver ranked middle of the pack in rushing this season, but are getting bang for their buck with undrafted running back C.J. Anderson (2013), who has rushed for 1,500-plus yards combined the last two seasons. Although neither Anderson nor Ronnie Hillman (No. 67 overall, 2012) are core players, they create a tandem backfield that gets the job done more times than not.\n\nWhile free agent additions might be the backbone to the Broncos' roster, the team's success on draft weekend has been equally as important to Denver playing in Super Bowl 50.\n\nDating back to 2010, the Broncos have drafted very well with their first pick in the draft: wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (2010), linebacker Von Miller (2011), defensive tackle Derek Wolfe (2012), defensive tackle Sylvester Williams (2013), cornerback Bradley Roby (2014) and defensive end Shane Ray (2015).\n\nWith the exception of Ray, who was a nickel rusher as a rookie in 2015, the Broncos' first pick in the draft since 2010 have each been key starters on the current squad. Roby technically started only four games this past season, but his playing time is near equal to a starter due to the amount of nickel packages.\n\nThe Broncos have been far from perfect on draft weekend. They swung and missed on running back Montee Ball (No. 58 overall, 2013) and wide receiver Cody Latimer (No. 56, 2014) has taken longer than expected to develop. But Elway and his staff deserve credit for their work through the draft, especially considering they haven't drafted in the top-20 picks since 2011.\n\nElway was a Super Bowl-winning quarterback on the field and he might be a Super Bowl-winning executive off the field if the Broncos can pull the upset over the Panthers in Super Bowl 50. And if that happens, his accomplishments as a general manager will have been earned through hard work, preparation and talent -- just like his accomplishments as a quarterback.\n\n\"Really, what I was drawing off and have been drawing off, is my experience in my career,\" Elway said. \"When we won those two Super Bowls, what was the formula? The formula was to play good defense, and offensively, it was about running the ball.\"\n\nSome will say that it doesn't take talent to open a checkbook and write down numbers and that would be correct. However, Elway has been more than an ATM or figure head -- he has had a plan since the day he took office. And while it hasn't always been pretty, that plan has the Broncos planning for the ultimate prize on Super Bowl Sunday.",

                    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- The Denver Broncos took a little field trip Monday as the team headed to Stanford University to take a look at what will be their practice home for the week leading up to Super Bowl 50.\n\nThe Broncos will have their first full practice of the week Wednesday as they stick to a schedule that is similar to what they use during the regular season. But coach Gary Kubiak took the team over to Stanford on Monday for a quick trip just so Wednesday wouldn't be the first time the players had been to the practice field.\n\nTeam officials described it as a \"get acclimated\" type of visit, with only some light work to go with their meetings.\n\nAnd call it a lesson learned, but one significant difference between the team's practices of late, according to several Broncos players, and the last time the team was in the Super Bowl -- to close out the 2013 season -- was the Broncos have made it a point to crank up the noise at practice.\n\nOn the Broncos' first play from scrimmage in Super Bowl XLVIII, center Manny Ramirez couldn't hear the cadence from Peyton Manning and snapped the ball unexpectedly. The ball sailed past Manning's head, resulted in a safety and set the tone for what became a 35-point loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nKubiak had the Broncos' practice with noise last week at the Broncos' facility and said he would do the same at Stanford in the week to come. Kubiak said Manning had \"mentioned\" the play from Super Bowl XLVIII when the team started its preparations.\n\n\"We're practicing with noise,\" Kubiak said earlier this week. \"[The crowd] should be split right down the middle. I assume that's the way it is ... so we took the approach this week to practice with noise.\"\n\nThe Broncos installed much of the game plan before they left Denver on Sunday, so this week's practices will be more about refining what they've already worked on and to make any adjustments they feel are necessary as the week progresses.\n\n\"We feel like we're ready to go,\" linebacker Brandon Marshall said. \"We'll get ourselves right, the coaches will have us ready to go.\"",

                    "body": "Hey by the time that you read this article, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will have won the Iowa caucuses' (maybe). One thousand questions will have been asked about the arm strength of the Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, (probably). And last but not least, the Broncos defense will not have enough kryptonite to weaken the super athletic powers of the Carolina Panthers superstar quarterback, halfback, fullback, Cam Newton, (more than likely).\n\nRacial purist's disguised as football fans can drink \"haterade' until their stomachs burst but the Denver Broncos are nearing their final destination as far as the 2015 season is concerned.\n\nThe Broncos are not destined to be in the winner's circle when the clock expires on February 7, 2016 at the end of Super Bowl 50.\n\nIf the Broncos win I will stand outside of my downtown Pittsburgh office clothed only in a sheet and will allow the photo to be seen by all of my readers. If the Panthers prevail, the first reader to send email me, will have the opportunity to take me out to lunch and pick my brain about sports and about anything else, (I will leave the tip, any place is good even McDonald's).\n\nIf Cam Newton blows it for me I will curse him to be forced to compete with deflated footballs forever.\n\nI am from the old school. I loved it when I saw the video of Seattle Seahawks All-Pro cornerback Richard Sherman dropping an RKO on fellow All-Pro Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews during last Sunday's NFL Pro-Bowl game.\n\nWith all of the long blonde hair, good ole boy versus the dreadlock thug social values that some people are currently trying to use to divide America as well sports, it is refreshing to see two grown famous rich athletes, allowing the little boy in them to come out.\n\nForget about dividing and conquering. How about unifying and conquering?\n\nSherman and Matthews may have started a trend of not asking the asinine question; \"can't we all just get along?\" as opposed to just getting along.\n\nSome of the Twitter \"sloggers\" seem to be sinking in quicksand mixed with poop. They want to see White versus Black, Hispanic, Asian, Indians, and Jews: just White against everybody else.\n\nLet's quit trying to dominate, and attempt to reciprocate. May we begin accepting each other's \"trains of thought,\" as opposed to insisting that everyone else mirrors one set of ideas and theories?\n\nFor God sake, football is just a sport! I have not heard any breaking stories concerning any life preserving cures for cancer, diabetes, heart disease or any other health or life threatening disease that emerged from the 2015 NFL Pro-Bowl.\n\nI am also certain that at the end of Super Bowl 50, there will be no press conferences held other than to say which team lost and which team won, and why.\n\nSo to all of you \"race-baiting\" naysayers out there hiding behind the internet all I have to say is this; we Americans may lose a few battles but when the smoke clears, whether it is on the football fields or the killing fields, we will stand toe to toe and the melody that we celebrate at the end of the day will not be \"Taps\" but will always be Aaron Copeland's; \"Fanfare for the Common Man.\"\n\nAubrey Bruce can be reached at: abruce@newpittsburghcourier.com or 412.583.6741",

                    "body": "58 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nIn the week leading up to Super Bowl 50, USA TODAY Sports will highlight five matchups that could help decide whether the Carolina Panthers or Denver Broncos prevail. In our second installment, we highlight Broncos running back C.J. Anderson against the Panthers front seven.\n\nThe Broncos likely can't afford to have \"The Sheriff\" lead them into a shootout.\n\nThough Peyton Manning hasn't been held back in his return from a torn plantar fascia, Denver coach Gary Kubiak has continued to demand a balanced attack from his offense. Facing a ball-hawking Carolina defense that ranks first in the NFL with 39 regular-season takeaways, the Broncos will be further enticed to establish their running game early.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSuper Bowl 50 matchups: Panthers TE Greg Olsen vs. Broncos safeties\n\nMaintaining an even-keeled attack against the Panthers is a game plan far more easily outlined than executed, however. Carolina has outscored its opponents 265-121 in the first half this season, which has frequently forced teams to abandon the run and play a more predictable style.\n\nKubiak, however, has taken the long view over the course of games in remaining committed to the run. C.J. Anderson has 239 rushing yards on 46 attempts (5.2 yards per carry) in his last three games for the Broncos. Though he splits carries with Ronnie Hillman, his one-cut style has suited Denver more than Hillman's laterally oriented running.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDon't be surprised if Broncos LB Von Miller is Super Bowl 50's breakout star\n\nThe Panthers have allowed just 100 rushing yards or more (Denver averages 107.4 per game) in just one of their last 11 games. Nose tackle Star Lotulelei and linebacker Luke Kuechly have made Carolina particularly imposing up the middle, and the two could make it difficult for Anderson to find the seams he seeks.\n\nTeams have chipped away at the big leads that Carolina has compiled, though coming all the way back has been an insurmountable task so far. How Anderson and Co. fare in the Super Bowl might determine whether Denver will face a similar climb.\n\n***\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz\n\nPHOTOS: Broncos' road to Super Bowl 50\n\nRoad to Super Bowl 50: One great photo from each Broncos game Fullscreen The AFC champion Denver Broncos, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning, are headed to Super Bowl 50 after a 12-4 regular season and pair of narrow wins in the playoffs.

I'm sorry I put you through that.)\n\nHeading into Sunday's games, the general consensus pinned the New England Patriots as a lock to make it back to the \"large\" game -- utilizing Roger Goodell's bounty for the suspected use of deflated footballs as fuel to a remarkable seventh Super Bowl appearance in the Belichick-Brady era. Unfortunately for New England, their efforts fell short as the Denver Broncos pulled out a nail-biter behind a fierce pass rush and the curiously rejuvenated arm of Peyton Manning.\n\nOver in the NFC, the fun-loving (and dabbing) Carolina Panthers matched up against the gunslinging strategery of the Arizona Cardinals. Carolina and Arizona were by far the two best teams in the NFC all season, so the game was set up to mirror the dramatic elements of its predecessor. Wrong. Put it this way: Carolina scored so much that every child in Carolina may have their own football (a player gives away the ball after each touchdown scored).\n\nGiven that this the first time the two teams have met this season, here are some crucial things to watch out for when you tune into the big game.\n\nDenver Broncos\n\nPeyton Manning: The prospects of the Broncos winning this game begins and ends with the throwing prowess of \"The Sheriff\". If Manning continues to show the arm strength that we saw on Sunday, Denver should be able to put up 20-plus points. Manning's lack of arm strength has dictated the entire offense for much of the season. If he is now able to throw different route combinations other than an out or a slant, that in itself is a game changer.\n\nEmmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas: Chunk yardage and big plays are going to be a necessity for Denver to be victorious and both dynamic wideouts have the skill set to break one loose at any moment. Look for Manning to try to hit Sanders over the top while Thomas elects to pile on yardage after the catch with various short-to-intermediate routes.\n\nVon Miller: What a ferocious performance Miller had on Sunday against the Patriots. New England's offensive line never had a chance en route to a 2.5 sack performance along with an interception that very few at his position could have made. Miller will be a key cog in the game plan to stop Cam Newton. Also: Keep an eye out for his sack dance. It isn't exactly G-rated, but it will bring out a chuckle.\n\nWhoever Defends Greg Olsen: Denver will have their hands full with Olsen, who has been Newton's favorite target all season. Expect the Broncos to treat Olsen much like\n\nthey treated Rob Gronkowski on Sunday by surrounding him with two or even three defenders if warranted.\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\nCam Newton: The future league MVP will finally get his chance to shine on football's biggest stage. Cam has never shied away from the spotlight, but it is fair to assume that there will be nerves involved at the outset. It will be crucial for him to get off to a good start to shed away the nerves and play his routinely superhuman brand of football.\n\nJonathan Stewart: Denver has one of the best pass rushes in the league. In order to refute that, Carolina will have to use their ground game as a neutralizer. Stewart is a bruising back who relishes on the attention opposing defenses pay to Newton's rushing ability. He should be able to find some holes, though it won't be a walk in the park. New England's leading rusher against Denver was the lumbering clydesdale himself, Tom Brady.\n\nAny Receiver Not Named Greg Olsen: Unsung heroes have been prevalent in past Super Bowls and I have a sneaky suspicion that someone like Corey Brown or Devin Funchess could come up big. They will certainly have opportunities with the Broncos' secondary having to account for Olsen.\n\nThe Safeties: Josh Norman and Co. have played well for Carolina on the outside all season, but Manning will take his shots over the top if the safeties creep too far toward the line of scrimmage. If the safeties can keep Thomas and Sanders in front of them, the Panthers defense is in business.\n\n-Being the one stuck with having to explain the game of football to the person that only watches on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\n-Over 3,858,697 mentions of Peyton Manning's \"legacy.\"\n\n-All of the Super Bowl commercials being a letdown.\n\n-Your drunk Patriots fan friend who is still bitter and obnoxiously ruins the viewing experience.\n\n-People who won't stop asking when Beyonce is going to come on.",

                    "title": "Film Room: Big Pass Plays And The Super Bowl",
                    "body": "One big pass play can change the complexion of a Super Bowl. It does not always have to be a deep pass, but most big passing plays come on long throws. Just think where these games may have gone in the last decade if these long gains had never happened.\n\nAside from the Kearse catch, each of these plays led to points for the winning team. You have quarterbacks extending plays, receivers breaking tackles, defenses blowing coverages, and some wild deflections. In the biggest game of the year, you will take a big play by any means necessary.\n\nFor the purposes of this study, we are going to define a big pass play as any gain of at least 25 yards (regardless of air yards). Barring a return to form for Demaryius Thomas or Peyton Manning hitting Emmanuel Sanders in stride, you do not really expect the Denver offense to add to this list of big pass plays. On 718 pass plays this season (including the playoffs), the Broncos have 30 completions that gained at least 25 yards (4.2 percent), the fifth-lowest rate in the league. Meanwhile, Carolina's defense allowed the second-lowest rate (3.4 percent) of big pass plays.\n\nIn Super Bowl 50, the matchup of Carolina's big-play offense and Denver's great defense is the one to watch. Behind Cam Newton, Carolina's offense ranks fourth in big pass play rate (6.1 percent) with 36 completions, including a season-high four against a good Arizona defense in the NFC Championship Game. You might expect that the only defense to rank ahead of Carolina here to be Denver, but that is not the case -- it is the Bengals. The Broncos are eighth in limiting big pass plays (4.4 percent), and they allowed three in each playoff game to Ben Roethlisberger and Tom Brady, who were getting their second looks at Wade Phillips' defense this season. Those two passers combined for one such completion in their first meetings with Denver.\n\nIn reviewing the big pass plays created by the Carolina offense and allowed by the Denver defense this season, some trends emerged. The following table summarizes the findings.\n\nWe will look at some of these in greater detail, but let's start with some of the basics. First, this is a shotgun-heavy league, and both units saw 28 of these plays come from the shotgun or pistol. That makes it a little harder to take advantage of play-action passing, but Carolina does more of that than Denver's defense saw. Newton usually uses play-action from the shotgun, with hesitation that he may run working to his favor.\n\nNewton definitely likes to throw the ball vertically down the field. His average pass attempt traveled 10.5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage this season, third in the league behind only Roethlisberger (10.6) and Carson Palmer (10.9). When he is looking for a big play, he usually throws deep, as over half of the plays here were thrown beyond 25 yards. That may not be as effective against Denver's talented secondary, which should have both safeties (T.J. Ward and Darian Stewart) back healthy for the Super Bowl. With Tyrann Mathieu out, Arizona's safeties really struggled against this Carolina offense. Including the playoffs, Denver allowed 8-of-44 completions (18.2 percent) on passes thrown at least 25 yards down the field. Newton is 19-of-62 (30.7 percent) on such throws this season. You can count on Carolina to take some shots with a receiving corps that has speed and size.\n\nNone of the big plays for Carolina came from screen passes, while the Broncos were gashed for big gains on bubble screens to Golden Tate and De'Anthony Thomas. There was a little more variety to the big plays allowed by Denver, including more YAC plays, which is really not a Carolina strength.\n\nMy main motivation to look at this was probably the perceived weakness of Denver's defense against mobile quarterbacks. In previewing the AFC Championship Game, I noticed the top five games in yards allowed against Denver were to teams with mobile quarterbacks such as Ben Roethlisberger (twice), Andrew Luck, Jay Cutler and Teddy Bridgewater. The Chicago game was especially noteworthy, with Cutler able to hit four big pass plays (a season-worst for Denver) even though Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal were on the inactive list. Maybe the familiarity John Fox and offensive coordinator Adam Gase had with Denver's personnel helped that day, but there were receivers left wide-open for Cutler.\n\nYou can see the hurry-up offense helped catch Denver off guard here, and some subtle movement from Cutler in the pocket opened up an easy throwing lane to a wide-open receiver with Aqib Talib in coverage. If Cutler had thrown a better pass, this likely would have been a touchdown.\n\nDenver loves to play man coverage, so it could be in trouble when the play breaks down and the receivers start running a second route for some old-fashioned backyard football. The counterpoint to this would be the Green Bay game where, despite Aaron Rodgers' scrambling, his receivers were still plastered by Denver's secondary and the Packers finished with 50 net passing yards. However, Rodgers did not have a very good group of receivers this year. Newton has the ability to extend the play, and his receivers are fast enough to get open against man coverage.\n\nBut after studying these 68 plays, I was surprised to discover just how many came from standard, in-the-pocket offense. Only five plays saw the quarterback get out of the pocket. Newton was only pressured on five of his throws, but more on that later. Denver got pressure nine times, but the quarterback still made some good throws, which you just have to live with.\n\nThe most surprising part was finding just three plays where Newton extended things by scrambling, or when the defense made him move to a different release point. Denver only had this happen four times, with Cutler having two of the plays, and Bridgewater and Roethlisberger having one each. Upon further review of the Indianapolis game where the Broncos' pass defense had a season-worst 51.3% DVOA, Luck just did a really good job of hanging in there until the last possible second before releasing the ball. So I identified the right type of quarterbacks against this defense, but the actual act of extending the play to hit a big gain was simply a very rare occurrence both for the Denver defense and for the Carolina offense. That is not to say Newton is incapable of doing so on Sunday night, but it has not been necessary for the Panthers this season. The blocking has been strong, and the receivers do their job well.\n\nHere is Newton avoiding the pass rush against the Colts and doing a great job to find fullback Mike Tolbert wide-open in the flat. Tolbert had plenty of room ahead of him for a 40-yard gain, the longest of the season for any Carolina running back. This offense only had 51 catches by running backs, so this is definitely not the norm.\n\nA week later against Green Bay, Newton had no problem with a three-man rush on third-and-16, stepping up to find Jerricho Cotchery wide open for a 59-yard gain, his longest reception of the season. The only other time Newton extended the play was in Week 17 against Tampa Bay. After avoiding a sack, he was nearly intercepted, but got the fortunate bounce to Devin Funchess for a 41-yard gain. Yeah, it's just been that kind of year for Carolina.\n\nWhat really stood out in watching Carolina's offense was the use of seven-man protection schemes, usually keeping a running back and tight end in to block. Tolbert and backup tight end Ed Dickson may not get a lot of touches, but they play a lot of snaps and are willing blockers. You can see Carolina faced the same average number of rushers (4.4) as Denver sent, with neither seeing a ton of blitzing, but the difference comes in blocking. Teams only went to a max-protection scheme twice against Denver, while Carolina used at least seven blockers 13 times. Despite only sending three receivers on routes, Carolina was able to get receivers wide open while giving Newton a pristine pocket from which to throw.\n\n7-man protection scheme is crucial to Carolina's deep passing game. Ridiculous how open the receivers get. pic.twitter.com/5xhbNjPtJT -- Scott Kacsmar (@FO_ScottKacsmar)\n\nJanuary 30, 2016\n\nWhen you can get protection like that and have a speedster like Ted Ginn Jr. against Brandon Browner, you get a 55-yard completion.\n\n7-man protection + Brandon Browner in coverage = pristine pocket and a 55-yard completion. pic.twitter.com/LoGkBvEZZO -- Scott Kacsmar (@FO_ScottKacsmar)\n\nFebruary 1, 2016\n\nGoing with extra blockers to help the tackles against Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware could be very beneficial to Carolina in this matchup. However, the receivers will have to make plays against a better secondary than the likes of New Orleans and Tampa Bay.\n\nDenver is known to play a lot of man coverage, and you can see 22 of the 32 plays allowed were in man coverage. They also had four blown coverages, including two easy 80-yard touchdowns to Charcandrick West and San Diego rookie Tyrell Williams. After Roethlisberger shredded Denver's man defense in Week 15, Phillips vowed to use more zone in the AFC divisional round matchup. Even with Antonio Brown inactive, Pittsburgh's receivers made some big plays against a confused Denver defense. This next play shows both the effect a mobile quarterback can have and Denver's discomfort with zone coverage.\n\nChris Harris is already a bit in no man's land in between the two receivers while covering the left slot, but as Roethlisberger moves up in the pocket, Harris reacts to him and leaves Martavis Bryant wide open. Bryant's speed after the catch led to a 52-yard gain.\n\nIn the first couple games of the season, Carolina's fastest receivers (Ginn and Corey Brown) were roasting man coverage with double moves. You started to see more zone, but there was also some really bizarre stuff like a linebacker trying to cover Ginn down the field. Of course that was New Orleans (post-Rob Ryan firing), but even Atlanta did the same thing a week later for a 46-yard touchdown. The Seahawks had problems with tight ends all year and Greg Olsen confused them for three big plays, including a game-winning touchdown that left Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas yelling at each other.\n\nCarolina forced eight plays with a blown coverage or a receiver left totally uncovered. This can be a very difficult offense to prepare for given that it forces you to defend the run of both the back and the quarterback. When the Panthers are in short-yardage situations, they can be very deceptive and get an open receiver, like this throwback play to Olsen against Houston in Week 2.\n\nAfter all this buildup, it will probably be Vernon Davis with the longest catch of the night on a bootleg pass no one thought Manning could make. But this should be a great matchup to watch. Denver will likely play a lot of man, putting Harris and Bradley Roby on the speedier receivers in Ginn and Brown. Talib is a better fit for the bigger Funchess or apossession receiver like Cotchery. If the Broncos do play zone, they had better hope the safety gets there in time with the speed of these receivers, but Olsen really seems to be the key factor to this game.\n\nFrom the success Rob Gronkowski had against Danny Trevathan, I am not sure the Broncos can expect their linebackers to win many of those matchups down the seam. Olsen may not be dominant after the catch, but he is fast and runs his routes crisply like a wideout. That is why I would use Talib on him at times, especially if Carolina loads up on protection.\n\nDenver should stick with the minimal blitzing strategy from last week, but defending Brady and the Patriots is much different than defending Newton. As much as it would appear that Denver has enough to cover these receivers, we see defenses lose track of them anyway by peeking into the backfield in fear of the run.\n\nOne big pass play can completely turn this game around. Denver should know that as well as any team. We'll just have to see if Carolina or Denver can add another big pass play to Super Bowl lore.",

                    "title": "Stories abound as Super Bowl week kicks off",
                    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The Super Bowl is back in California for the first time in 13 years, and the 50th battle for the Lombardi Trophy offers a dynamic matchup between the Panthers and Broncos.\n\nBoth teams arrived last night, and the week of festivities begin tonight with the first primetime edition of Super Bowl Media Day.\n\nAs always, there is no shortage of storylines in the lead-up to Sunday's game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nThe Panthers and Broncos play an old-school brand of physical, intimidating football, and Panthers quarterback Cam Newton's rapid ascension yields a new-school twist.\n\nNewton will almost certainly win the MVP, which means he'll have a chance to join Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, Emmitt Smith, Steve Young and Kurt Warner as the seventh player in history to double up as the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nFrom start to (possibly) finish, this has been the year of Newton and the Panthers, and the quarterback has legitimized himself as one of the most dominant offensive forces in the league. That's been made all the more impressive by the relative lack of big-name weapons around him, as wide receiver Steve Smith left in 2014, running back DeAngelo Williams departed in 2015 and wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin tore his ACL in August.\n\nBut Newton led the Panthers to 14 consecutive regular-season wins and 17 victories in 18 games to this point. And he has completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 3,837 yards, 35 touchdowns and just 10 interceptions while running 132 times for 636 yards and 10 scores.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 245-pounder is a menace on third down, too, with 13 touchdowns (second most in the NFL) and a league-high 25 conversions on the ground (more than twice as many as all but four players).\n\nHowever, Newton's on-field brilliance has been met with widespread criticism from the \"what are we supposed to tell the children?\" crowd, who can't understand that football is meant to also be fun.\n\nGranted, the dab is insufferable, but there isn't a defense on the planet that can make him stop. Unfortunately, during a week like this, that storyline will get extra airtime from the entertainment media.\n\nOld man Peyton\n\nBroncos quarterback Peyton Manning told Bill Belichick after the AFC Championship Game this might be his \"last rodeo,\" so with a win, he has a chance to go out on top like his boss, John Elway.\n\nAt this point, Manning's arm strength resembles Archie's more than his own, but his supporting cast, both offensively and defensively, is about as strong as it's ever been in his 18th season. Manning's Super Bowl history is checkered, but he could join his brother, Eli, and become the 12th quarterback to win a pair of Super Bowls.\n\nBut in Manning's two losses, he threw a pick-6 on a decisive drive against the Saints in 2009 and was embarrassed by the Seahawks in 2013, which was tied for the third most lopsided Super Bowl in history. Elway knows that feeling, too.\n\nOh, and there's the HGH storyline. The NFL has announced it's investigating Manning's alleged receipt of an HGH delivery in 2011, while the 39-year-old has denied ever using the PED in the fallout of the Al Jazeera report. That subplot has been largely swept under the rug over the last month, but Manning can't hide from the allegations during four consecutive days at a podium this week.\n\nRoger that\n\nSome 367 days ago, Roger Goodell claimed that he's available to the media every day of the year. In a conservative estimate, Goodell has fallen short of that by about 350 interviews, but he gets his next chance Friday to stand before the masses.\n\nDeflategate will remain on the table, now and forever, as well as the league's apparent investigation into Manning's wife's HGH shipments. The \"Concussion\" movie will likely be addressed. It also seems fair to inquire about Greg Hardy's tone deaf remarks in the aftermath of his suspension.\n\nBut remember last year? Goodell was asked 28 questions, but only one Boston media member was called upon when droves wanted answers about Deflategate. Goodell's representatives instead doled out microphones to those who asked questions about the NFL's improved technology and the carrot it continues to dangle in front of the London audience. And this was when Goodell wasn't yucking it up with a junior reporter about their Play 60 mission.\n\nSo yeah, everyone would love to hear Goodell give genuine, informative responses about the league's shortcomings, but the reality is he'll probably spent the better portion of 45 minutes talking about how he and the league brought football back into the Los Angeles market.\n\nAnd don't forget the game\n\nAh yes, the game. The Panthers and Broncos try to kick in their opponents' organs for 60 minutes, and the Panthers' offense likes to get nasty, too. If you like to watch teams line up with the intention of beating the heck out of one another, this is the week for you.\n\nThis is a pretty cool week for 33-year-old pass rushers Jared Allen (Panthers) and Demarcus Ware (Broncos), who are making their first trips to the Super Bowl.\n\nKeep an eye on a couple local angles. Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly, a Boston College product, signed a five-year, $62 million contract extension this season. Kuechly, 24, is younger than both Dont'a Hightower, 25, and Jamie Collins, 26, but they'll be arguing for contracts in that range in the next year.\n\nSpeaking of money, Panthers cornerback Josh Norman may very well be the best at the position, and he's scheduled to be a free agent in March. Norman and Broncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders will have the best battle on the perimeter in the game.\n\nBroncos cornerback Aqib Talib spent a year and a half with the Patriots. Former Pats second-round pick Ras-I Dowling could potentially play the role of Talib on the Panthers' practice squad.",

                    "title": "Tales from the Dark Side: Super Bowl 50 predictions",
                    "body": "As the most well-known Raider fan along the Front Range, many of you have asked for my thoughts on the Denver Broncos' success this year after previously saying this team was \"fools gold.\" My response is this: Making it to the Super Bowl party is only half the journey. Winning the Super Bowl is the goal. I stand by my statement.\n\nNo, Joe Williams is not my father, and to paraphrase the late Dale Earnhardt and Ricky Bobby, \"second place is the first loser.\" Enter the Lamar Hunt and George S. Halas participation trophies.\n\nAs we know, defense wins championships. Offen$e put$ fanny$ in $eat$, and I $ee lot$ of No. 18 jer$ey$ in tho$e $eat$ and a very good defense on the field. Now for the caveat.\n\nThe Broncos have been in a similar position before, waltzing into a Super Bowl with the No. 1 scoring defense holding opponents to a game average of 14 points and a season high of 30. That team went to the Super Bowl and The G.O.A.T, Joe Montana, dropped 55 on them. One of the ugliest losses in Super Bowl history, if not the ugliest.\n\nIt's hard to tell since the Broncos have a fistful of them. Yes, it is an old reference, but as we all know, history can and will repeat itself. One way or the other, NFL history is a scorned mistress.\n\nLook at the Raiders, who fell prey to two of arguably best defenses of all time, the 2001 Baltimore Ravens and the 2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Both mirror this year's Broncos team. Great defense and an offense that makes you say WTF?\n\nOf course No. 18 is 1,000 times the quarterback Trent Dilfer and Brad Johnson are, even tied together on PEDs and at their best.\n\nI think Denver's own Drew Litton's Cartoon in this month's issue of Mile High Sports Magazine, titled \"Broncos fan selfie,\" best describes the way many of you feel about the Broncos offense. Make sure you get a copy.\n\nNow, here is the breakdown.\n\nFirst things first. Both of these teams are here because of defense, don't let the media fool you. This is not Cam Newton vs. Peyton Manning. This Panthers team is complete, top to bottom.\n\nCarolina Offense vs. Denver Defense\n\nCould you ask for a better matchup? I don't need to school you on this; for that matter what I will say is that this matchup that can go either way. The Panthers offense completely decimated the high-powered Cardinals defense in 15 minutes, who had no chance of recovery after that. Amassing just 287 yards in the NFC title game, against arguably the best team in football this year, the Cardinals had no shot that day. By the way, the Panthers have beaten the Nos. 2, 3 and 5 defenses.\n\nAnd guess who is next up? Mr. Newton himself. The Broncos have the horses to corral a wily quarterback who throws BBs. That cannot be their focus. With the Panthers' arsenal of weapons, The No Fly Zone will be tested early. A strong run game supports the most polarizing player in the game, who in true leadership fashion has absorbed all of the criticism himself and shielded his teammates. Like a Superman of the Justice League should.\n\nThis has the makings of a Floyd Mayweather fight. Lots of hype, but in the end just lots of strategies playing out to get the win, and no definitive knockout blow.\n\nNow, the Panthers O-line. The presumed NFL MVP would not be in this position without his dancing bears Michael Oher, Mike Remmers, Trai Turner, Andrew Norwell and the anchor, center Ryan Kalil. This group will have to play its best game against a Broncos unit that has been at the forefront of the NFL's best total defense all year.\n\nThis needs to be the Denver Broncos defense's finest hour. As Broncos defensive tackle Sylvester Williams said on my show, The Nosebleed Section, \"The best has yet to come from this team.\" I don't think I need to tell you all how good the Broncos defense is. Sly, Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson have 13 sacks as an interior unit.\n\nThis Panthers team is what we all thought the Packers were when that team came into Mile High during the regular season. For crying out loud, Newton has made castoff Ted Ginn Jr. look like Mushin Muhammad reincarnated and he's resurrected Jerricho Cotchery's career. Remember how the Panthers threw away Steve Smith and we were wondering how and who Cam would be playing catch with?\n\nDid I mention that the Broncos have the No. 1 defense? A defense whose best test came twice against perennial powerhouse New England and answered every question levied against it?\n\nYes, Olson is no Gronk; but he is still one the top tight ends in the game. Did I fail to mention as a team the Broncos are coming into this game having faced adversity, criticisms, allegations, fanbase division and started their second string quarterback for a significant portion of the season? Oh and they have the No. 1 defense.\n\nOnly ham and eggs sports talk radio host and complete homers will dismiss the accomplishments of the Carolina offense. Did I tell you about the Broncos No. 1 defense?\n\nYes, it's not Randy Gradishar and Lyle Alzados' 77 Orange Crush; what it is, is a unit that has routinely shown it's penchant and lust for being the underdog. Did I remind you they were ranked No. 1 overall?\n\nIf The Duke is really that great of a football guy he would lock up the son of Bum with a lifetime contract. If there is one thing I know it is this: Wade Phillips has proven he is capable of being a head coach he just isn't a very good one (Music City miracle.) Call him the Norv Turner of defensive strategies. Plenty of chances, not a lot of success as a head coach.\n\nCarolina Defense vs. Denver Offense\n\nThe Panthers were sixth in the NFL with 44 sacks, led by defensive tackle Kawann (K-Won) Short, who had 11. This D-line is aggressive, cunning and smart and unlike anything the Broncos O-line has seen all year. That patchwork quilt of an O-line that was pieced together from parts old and now appears to have gelled together at the right time, much to the joy of Broncos fans everywhere. It's a minor miracle this group has not gotten Nos. 17 and 18 killed this year, although this unit has seen its moments. (Pinning the career day that Khalil Mack had on Michael Scofield is a bad play; the Broncos gave him no help.)\n\nI was wondering what Rick Dennison was thinking that day. Yes, you do remember him right? I think he is Elway's golf partner and the fourth person at card games in the locker room. This guy gets no credit or criticism at all here in the Mile High City because of the \"Kubiak\" system.\n\nRon Rivera, the 85 Bears linebacker turned head coach, opens things up for a Panthers linebacking corps led by Luke Kuechly. Running the ball is going to be tough for both of these teams; the Panthers rank fourth in run defense and the Broncos third. When the Broncos get 100 yards on the ground, they usually win the game. Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson will need to go wonder twins in this matchup.\n\nRivera's staff also should receive kudos for creating an environment that allows his players' personalities to flourish. As Nostradamus so eloquently said in his quatrains, this is \"The young lion versus the old lion.\" Led by two linebackers that could possibly be the best tandem in the history of the NFL, Thomas Davis Jr. & Kuechly are the extension of head coach \"Riverboat\" Ron who last year at this time was worried about his job at 7-8-1. Davis, with his broken twig suffered in the NFC title game win and his three ACL surgeries, is the embodiment of a true NFL Gladiator, and Kuechly isn't far behind. At this point I have to push all my chips to the Panthers side of the table because I haven't even gotten to seasoned vets Roman Harper and the biggest free agent for the offseason, Josh Norman, who cuts the field in half with his play and will get paid. That being said, the loss of Charles Tillman was a blow to that defensive backfield and Cortland Finnegan, signed late in the year, has been a liability.\n\nLong story short, half of the field will probably be open when 18 is dropping back to pass in Santa Clara.\n\nIt breaks down like this: This Panthers team is who we thought the Packers were coming into Mile High during the regular season.\n\nUnless the Denver defense can pitch a few shutout quarters of football, this is a push agianst the Broncos offense. These two elements of the game should be the focal point. I have to go with the Panthers here.\n\nIf the Broncos can stop the Panthers offense they will be considered a top-three defense all-time.\n\nOnly a division opponent who has plenty of dirt on them have been able to slow the roll of the Panthers this season. Something we know all to well in the AFC West.\n\nHow many times have you seen a team with nothing to play for jump up and snake bite a team late in the year? For the Panthers it came at the right time, taking pressure of a potentially perfect season off the entire team, allowing them to move on to the next game and put it behind them. (They responded like a championship team should by getting right back to their winning ways.)\n\nThis Broncos team has answered its own adversity time and time again and silenced its critics by making it this far. Congratulations. Now be the team that you say you are and bring the Lombardi trophy to Denver.\n\nSorry, but No. 1 defense or not the Broncos offense is going to have to play its best game of the year to win. That's where I have the issue.\n\nI have no horse in this race and it's my job to cover sports, not pick games. Those guys are called Handicappers.\n\nI have to say that Broncos defense vs. Panthers offense is a push and I have to go Panthers defense over the Broncos offense. Sorry, Denver.",

                    "body": "There's been plenty of talk about how Sunday could mark the \"last rodeo\" for Peyton Manning. If he finds a way to lead the Broncos to a win over Carolina and then calls it a career, he'll join some pretty exclusive company. Here's a look at four other players who won it all and then decided to hang them up.\n\nJerome Bettis: After a decade with the Steelers, the Pittsburgh running back was a part of a team that ended up dumping the Seahawks in Super Bowl XL in Bettis' hometown of Detroit. (Did you know Bettis was from Detroit?) It wasn't the best game of his career, but the Hall of Famer had 43 yards on 14 carries in the win for the Steelers. The running back retired at the age of 33 with 13,662 rushing yards and a Super Bowl ring.\n\nRay Lewis: The Ravens beat the Niners in Super Bowl XLVII, the last game for Lewis after a 17-year career with Baltimore. (That came two weeks after the Ravens upset the Patriots in the AFC title game in Foxboro.) The controversial linebacker, who may or may not have had some help getting healthy with some deer antler spray in the weeks leading up to the game, ended with two Super Bowl rings.\n\nJohn Elway: The model for every other quarterback, including Manning. Elway went out like every quarterback hopes to finish his career, winning back-to-back titles at the end of the 1997 and 1998 seasons before riding off into the sunset. The Hall of Famer then came back to take over the Broncos, and he reportedly played a sizable role in convincing Manning to join the Broncos. (Manning supplanted him as the oldest quarterback to get his team to a Super Bowl, and if Denver wins on Sunday, Manning will take over Elway's spot as the oldest QB to win a Super Bowl.)\n\nMichael Strahan: Avert your eyes, Patriots fans -- the Giants defensive end was part of the New York team that knocked off the 2007 Patriots in Super Bowl XLII in Arizona. (Like Bettis, it was his only title.) Strahan called it a career after the game, finishing with 141.5 sacks after 15 seasons in the NFL.",

According to Odds Shark, the Panthers are 5.5-point favorites over the Broncos, a reflection of their superior regular season and the brilliant football they've played in this postseason, save for the second-half sleepwalk against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe over-under is a modest 45 points as of Monday. Both teams sport brilliant defenses, with the Broncos holding an edge in that category thanks to stalwart players like linebacker Von Miller, safety T.J. Ward and cornerback Chris Harris Jr.\n\nShare Tweet Embed\n\nCarolina's crushing defense is only a tick less fearsome. Linebacker Luke Kuechly has returned two interceptions for touchdowns in these playoffs. For those keeping score at home, that's two more TDs than any Broncos receiver has in this postseason.\n\nConsidering that two strong defenses, one good offense (Panthers) and one mediocre offense (Broncos) are taking the field at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on Feb. 7, it's interesting that 60 percent of bettors are taking the over.\n\nThere must be a good amount of faith in Cam Newton and Company to put up some points after racking up 80 so far in the playoffs. Jonathan Stewart and Newton combine for the league's best running game, while tight end Greg Olsen is always good for a handful of chain-moving receptions.\n\nWhile wide receivers Ted Ginn Jr. and Philly Brown hardly strike fear into opponents, it's possible that they could still have a big game against Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib. Fox Sports' Matt Chatham explained why Ginn, who has 10 touchdowns on the year, has been so effective in Carolina:\n\nIn the true receiver group, Ginn's 10 touchdowns this season are about the same as the number he'd accumulated over the previous eight years in the league. Ginn was always considered an excellent returner, but his receiving history was a mixed bag. He was a speed and run-after-the-catch guy, but never a catch gobbler.\n\nBut that's why he's such a perfect fit for in Carolina. A typical day for him amounts to a few catches, one of which is usually a big, game-changing play. On Sunday, Ginn ran a reverse for a touchdown, which was emblematic of his elite return skills, the kind of play that keeps a defense honest and not just lagging off him to prevent shot plays.\n\nGinn, Brown and the rest of the pass-catching corp will have to get open quickly. As Miller and Demarcus Ware demonstrated against New England in the AFC Championship Game, they can get to the quarterback in a hurry.\n\nMiller put on the performance of a lifetime in terrorizing Tom Brady, racking up 2.5 sacks, one interception and forcing him into bad throws on several other plays.\n\nMiller is well aware that attacking Newton will be a tough challenge. \"I don't think there's another quarterback that's ever played the game the way he does, especially the way his personality is on the field,\" Miller said, via the Charlotte Observer's Rick Bonnell. \"I'm just a big fan of everything that he has going for him.\"\n\nShare Tweet Embed\n\nTo hit the over, the Broncos are likely going to have to put up a respectable point total as well (doubly so if they're going to win the game).\n\nNFL.com analyst Bucky Brooks believes 39-year-old Peyton Manning must accept his newfound role as a game manager, including deferring to the running game against the Panthers' aggressive defense:\n\nManning's game-management skills also will be needed in the run game. He has a great feel for reading defensive fronts and frequently changes the direction of the run to hit the vulnerable bubble at the point of attack. This has played a key role in the Broncos' recent success running the ball; it will play a huge role in the Super Bowl 50 game plan against the Panthers' stellar defense. If Manning can consistently get the Broncos into the right call to enhance the chances of the running game, Denver can control the tempo of the game.\n\nManning has thrown for 398 yards and two touchdowns in the playoffs, with both of those scoring tosses going to tight end Owen Daniels.\n\nShare Tweet Embed\n\nIf the Broncos are going to win this game, it will be because running backs C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman prove capable of shouldering the load. Anderson's rushed for 144 yards and a score in the postseason, but Hillman has struggled mightily, averaging just 2.0 yards per carry.\n\nAs the lightning to Anderson's thunder, Hillman can lift the Broncos offense out of mediocrity if he's on his game. He has the speed to break big plays in the running game and keep linebackers on their toes as a passing option.\n\nIt's not impossible for the Broncos to beat the Panthers without a big rushing performance -- their defense is truly lethal -- but it's the surest way to victory with Manning the big question mark for arguably the first time in his career.\n\nOdds updated as of Monday, Feb. 1 at 2 p.m. ET.",

                    "body": "* NFL Quick Shots: Patriots may have won by losing; Packers could do same Sunday...\n\nYou may never hear this from me again, but I expect the Super Bowl to be decided on the ground. If Carolina runs 29 times, the Panthers will become the first team since the 1985 Bears to run at least 29 times in every game but one, according to footballoutsiders. Normally, I'd pick against the run-heavy team, but Carolina runs smart with misdirection and a mobile QB.\n\nDenver doesn't run smart. The Broncos are scared of an aging Peyton Manning making a mistake, so they run even when they aren't going anywhere; 18 of their 28 runs against the Patriots in the AFC Championship game gained 2 yards or fewer. No wonder they gained only five first downs on their last 13 drives.\n\nPanthers peaking\n\nIt's hard to go 15-1 during the regular season and still not hit your peak until the playoffs. The 1985 Chicago Bears might have done it. Carolina, at least so far, definitely has. The Panthers started 8-0 but won only one game by at least 14 points and none by more than 14. They've won six of their last 10 by 14 points, including four by at least 28. Footballoutsiders ranks their 49-15 NFC Championship rout of Arizona as the second-best playoff game it has measured in its 27 years, behind only the 49ers 44-3 wipeout of the Giants in 1993.\n\nAnother Gronkowski\n\nHere is hoping the Patriots draft Kansas State fullback Glenn Gronkowski, who told reporters he has never played with older brothers Rob, Chris and Dan, who all played in the NFL. \"They've always been too old for me. ... Everyone else has played together, so to be on the same team, that would be a dream come true.\"\n\nAFC's Big 4 QBs\n\nCam Newton is the 11th different NFC starting quarterback in the last 12 Super Bowls; the AFC's total is four with Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger and Joe Flacco.\n\nToo many close calls\n\nThe Broncos knocked Tom Brady down 20 times in the AFC Championship game, the most QB knockdowns by any team in any game this season. But Cam Newton won't stand still. Also, Denver has now set an NFL record with its 11th win by seven points or fewer. A bunch of close wins usually is a sign a team isn't as good as it's record (think Iowa in the Rose Bowl or the 1978 Houston Oilers who got drilled 34-5 by the Steelers in the AFC title game after winning 10 close games). But the other team with 10 close wins, the 2003 Panthers, almost won the Super Bowl.",

                    "body": "Super Bowl 50 is almost here! While my beloved New York Jets are not in the big game, I will still tune in. Why? Not only should it be exciting football, but it is a shared social event. Many people watch -- even those that aren't NFL fans -- for things like the commercials and the overall camaraderie and competition. Oh, there is a lot of snack-eating too!\n\nThis Sunday, February 7, the two competing teams are the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos. The former will be the champions. Well, at least according to predictions by both Microsoft's Bing and the Madden 16 video game. Will they be right?\n\n\"In Sunday's title game, the Bing Predicts models project 17-1 Carolina to win the Big Game with 64 percent probability. During the regular season, Carolina was the league's #1 scoring offense and #6 scoring defense, while Denver was the #20 scoring offense and #4 scoring defense. Carolina's rush offense was #2 vs #17 for Denver, and Denver's rush defense was #3 while Carolina's was #4. Both defenses are stout, so our models expect Carolina's much stronger offense to be the difference, becoming the first 18-win champion in 30 years\", says Walter Sun, Bing Predicts Team Lead.\n\nFamed video game maker, Electronic Arts, explains that its Madden 16 video game \"has tabbed the Carolina Panthers as the next world champions, defeating the Denver Broncos 24 - 20. For the first time ever, fans can get in on the action for themselves by heading over to the Madden NFL 16 Super Bowl Prediction Hub and create their own outcome based on a variety of factors. Fans can then share their dream Super Bowl 50 outcome with the hashtag #MyMaddenPrediction\".\n\nBefore you run out to place a bet, remember -- these are only predictions. While both Bing and Madden have good track records, past performance does not guarantee future results. In other words, Denver can absolutely still win the game. Heck, one injury to a key player can change everything.\n\nWhile the winner is still up in the air, one thing is for sure -- it should be an exciting quarterback battle between the elder Peyton Manning and the younger Cam Newton.",

                    "body": "The NFL is going all out to celebrate the 50th Super Bowl.\n\nIt's good to be the NFL -- in the most important Super Bowl to date, one of the game's most historic players, Peyton Manning, will encounter the game's future, Cam Newton, when the Denver Broncos dance with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nDid anyone mention it's good to be the NFL? The league has recruited the historic band Coldplay and once-in-a-generation talents Beyonce and Bruno Mars to perform the halftime show.\n\nWhat the globe knows about the halftime performances and the game itself is certainly worth a deeper dive. Let's do so below.\n\nGame Details\n\nWhen: Sunday, February 7, 6:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Levi's Stadium; Santa Clara, California\n\nTelevision: CBS\n\nOver/Under: 45\n\nSpread: Carolina (-5.5)\n\nHalftime Lowdown\n\nThe NFL announced Coldplay as the headline act back in December, but the league hinted at other big names possibly joining the band at Levi's Stadium.\n\nSophie Schillaci of Entertainment Tonight later reported Beyonce would join the band as well after headlining the show at Super Bowl 47 to rave reviews. Bruno Mars joined the act after following Beyonce's footsteps with a stellar showing at Super Bowl 48.\n\nIt's not hard to see the emphasis here. The NFL is bringing back some of the most notable performers from the game's recent history to celebrate the 50th anniversary. The idea seems to be the brainchild of Coldplay, as director Hamish Hamilton told Jessica Goodman of Entertainment Weekly that the legacy of the game stands as the focal point.\n\n\"The legacy of 50 Super Bowl halftimes will certainly be featured,\" Hamilton said. \"It may not be a literal thing, but you're definitely going to get the sense of 50. [And] there are always guests. I don't see why this show would be different.\"\n\nGiven the locale, the crew and performers won't have the cover of night to pull off wild special effects and light shows, meaning Coldplay and others will have to come up with something truly memorable with the sun still casting a glow on the stadium.\n\nOne thing seems certain: The current trio marked down as taking the stage at halftime won't be the only high-profile performers to do so. With an emphasis on the past, other halftime veterans will surely join at one point or another in an effort to not only celebrate the show's history, but etch out the best one yet.\n\nPreview and Prediction\n\nA photo posted by Carolina Panthers (@panthers) on Jan 31, 2016 at 3:35pm PST\n\nLike the halftime show, the game has themes and storylines worthy of the 50th Super Bowl.\n\nHere's Manning, who got benched while injured in the regular season, likely causing some to claim he should have hung up the cleats a year ago. But there he was in Week 17 coming on the field to a standing ovation, getting a win and then a pair of postseason wins to put himself and the Broncos into storybook-ending territory.\n\nAnd here's Newton, the latest dramatic evolution of the quarterback position, playing without No. 1 wideout Kelvin Benjamin all year. No problem: He threw for 3,837 yards and 35 touchdowns with another 636 yards and 10 touchdowns on the ground before breezing through the postseason.\n\nBehind them are two of the league's best defenses. During the regular season, both surrendered less than 20 points per game on average -- furthering the notion that defense wins championships.\n\nDenver makes its money through linebacker Von Miller and an elite pass rush that amassed 52 sacks. Carolina gets opportunistic play from corner Josh Norman and a unit that picked off a league-best 24 passes.\n\nExpect the game itself to follow the trend of the halftime show -- younger stars stepping into the limelight, and while honoring the past, putting on quite the show themselves.\n\nNewton won't have a problem besting Manning here. He's too elusive and able to make big plays down the field in various ways to succumb to the pressure applied by the Denver defense. Manning, while on an impressive return, has struggled to hit throws consistently since coming back and won't have long to do so against this Carolina defense, which can take advantage.\n\nAs the game wears on, Newton will run away from Manning while his defense makes a few key plays to officially secure a fitting passing-of-the-torch moment.\n\nPrediction: Panthers 28, Broncos 20\n\nStats courtesy of NFL.com and accurate as of February 1.

                    "body": "It's not uncommon for video game companies to run simulations of big games in their products to whip up a little consumer interest before the events. But when Electronic Arts' \"Madden NFL\" puts on its prognostication helmet, it's worth listening to what it has to say.\n\nThe long-running franchise, coming off last year's perfect prediction of the game, has projected the winner for Super Bowl 50: the Carolina Panthers.\n\nThe video game predicts the Panthers will keep pounding to beat the Denver Broncos on Sunday by a score of 24-20, with a dramatic finish led by Panther quarterback Cam Newton.\n\nHere's how it will play out, per the simulation. The first half will belong to the Panthers, starting with a big kick return by Ted Ginn Jr. By halftime, they'll have 17 unanswered points. But after Coldplay's halftime show, Peyton Manning and the Broncos will come roaring back, scoring 20.\n\nWith under a minute left, though, \"Madden\" predicts Newton will dive into the end zone for a game-winning touchdown. It also predicts Newton will get MVP honors.\n\nThrilling stuff, but there's no real reason to pay attention to a video game simulation of the biggest game of the year, is there? Before you answer, consider last year.\n\nPrior to Super Bowl XLIX, \"Madden\" not only perfectly nailed the final 28-24 score, it also foresaw Tom Brady's fourth-quarter game-winning pass to Julian Edelman. It knew the Patriots would score first and what the score would be at the end of the third quarter.\n\nWhile last year was the game's best prediction, it was hardly a fluke. In the 12 years that EA has rolled out a prediction, the game has accurately forecast the winner nine times. Six years ago it came within a point of the final score -- and nailed precisely how many yards Steelers wideout Santonio Holmes would run.\n\nBefore you rush out to meet your favorite bookie, though, it's worth noting that the game is hardly infallible. And when it misses the mark, it does so by a pretty wide margin. It gave the edge in Super Bowl XLVIII between Denver and the Seattle Seahawks to the Broncos, predicting Manning would lead his team to a 31-28 victory. In reality, it was a blowout 43-8 victory by Seattle.\n\nWant a little more historical knowledge before deciding how much faith to put into \"Madden's\" prediction? Here's a look at the game's full track record to date:",

                    "title": "Coach's guide to Super Bowl 50: Priorities for Broncos, Panthers",
                    "body": "It is always fun to get into the last week of the season and break down the priorities for the most overanalyzed game in sports. In the era of \"analytics,\" everyone with a smart phone has a complex algorithm that can statistically determine the outcome of the big game.\n\nLast week, I outlined how the most common bit of advice I received before Super Bowl XXXV was to have a game plan in place prior to traveling to the Super Bowl site -- and most importantly, to stick with that game plan.\n\nNaturally, you can point to all the conventional wisdom about winning the turnover battle, controlling the clock, etc. Every coach, however, knows to break it down to a few key priorities for your team to hook on to; you want your players to believe that, if they execute these things, the desired result will come. If you find that the game isn't quite working out as anticipated, so be it: improvise and adjust. But, if it does indeed go the way you've planned early on, your players will surge with confidence that they truly have the formula to win the Super Bowl.\n\nFinally, we've reached the point where we can quit talking about how healthy Peyton Manning is -- or if the Broncos should be running Gary Kubiak's offense, rather than doing what Peyton has done his entire Hall of Fame career. When John Elway and Kubiak sat down with Manning last offseason, they sold him on the formula that delivered Elway two Super Bowl wins late in his career, a formula that did not rely on him doing it single-handedly: play great defense, run the ball and get explosive plays out of a minimal number of throws. Even though it has not gone remarkably well to this point (Denver ranked 16th in total offense during the regular season), that is exactly what has to happen.\n\n\" Establish a ground game: The Broncos are 9-0 in games they run for more than 105 yards and 8-0 in games they log 30-plus rushing attempts. This is the heart of the Kubiak system. The problem is that, with Kawann Short and Star Lotulelei in the middle, and Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis (hopefully) at the next level, getting productive yards between the tackles against Carolina is going to be next to impossible. The Broncos are going to have to get the bounce-zone plays outside, setting up the zone-cutback plays where most of their big plays come from.\n\n\" Take your shots: It is going to be tough enough to run against the Panthers' front seven, let alone if the safeties and corners can squat inside of 15 yards. The best matchups on the field for Denver have to be with Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas testing the Carolina secondary. The Broncos are not going to beat Carolina with five or six drives of 10-plus plays. Explosive plays will be paramount -- if for nothing else, just to loosen up the running lanes.\n\n\" Notch 7s, not 3s: Denver ranked just 27th in the NFL in red-zone touchdown efficiency during the regular season. That is not going to cut it. If the Broncos settle for field goals when they get in the scoring area, it's over. Remember, Denver has to keep up with Carolina -- the NFL's highest scoring team.\n\n\" Stop the run: As good as the Denver defense is, the front seven, though athletic, is undersized and overmatched against Carolina's bludgeoning offensive line/ground game. The Broncos are going to have to commit more numbers to the box than normal. The good news is they have the secondary to match up one-on-one with the Panthers' receivers on the outside, which will allow Phillips to apply the bodies it is going to take to stop Cam Newton and company on the inside.\n\n\" Frustrate Cam: It has long been a defensive axiom: \"It is the front four's job to make the quarterback get the ball out quickly and it is the secondary's job to make him hold it.\" If the Broncos' secondary can make Cam wait out his receivers' routes, then Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware and whomever else Phillips wants to throw at Newton can get home.\n\n\" Create takeaways: The Broncos can't win unless they force turnovers and give their offense some short fields. Of course, this won't be easy. Since the beginning of December, Newton has 18 touchdowns against just two interceptions. Also, Newton's 110.4 passer rating against the blitz was the third-best mark in the NFL during the regular season. But Phillips might have to dial up the pressure constantly, to see if he can force a turnover, even though it's clearly risky business.\n\nCam Newton has done everything humanly possible to prove he is a championship-level quarterback. That includes beating you from the pocket, if that's what it takes. But the core of this offense is still the Panthers' ability to pound away with 235-pound back Jonathan Stewart ... then follow it up with the 250-pounder, Mike Tolbert ... then, when you are nice and tenderized, cut loose the gargantuan quarterback on designed runs. And after all of that, when you're forced to put everyone in the box, Carolina will kill you down the field with big plays.\n\n\" Pound the football: Carolina only ran the ball less than 30 times twice this season. And even in those two games, they ran for 171 yards on 29 carries against the Giants and 155 yards on 20 carries in their only loss of the year at Atlanta. The Panthers know that Denver is undersized and cannot hold up to the pounding they can deliver. And, when the Broncos have to play man -- to add the extra players to the box -- that is when Cam can take off for big gains on the ground, as the defensive backs all will have their backs turned to the line of scrimmage.\n\n\" Convert on third-and-medium/short: Oddly enough, Carolina is 30th in the NFL in third-down conversions of 3-to-5 yards. If the Panthers are able to run the ball the way I anticipate they will, they have to take advantage of the short third-down opportunities. As good as the Broncos were against Tom Brady and New England in their two games, they were just average overall during the season in this down-and-distance.\n\n\" YAC, YAC, YAC: Along with talking up a good game -- and the Panthers are the best in the league at this -- they will need to (and should have plenty of opportunities to) generate yards after the catch. This is where most of their explosive plays are likely to come. Ted Ginn Jr. only catches about half the balls thrown his way, but when he does haul it in, he seemingly always goes the distance.\n\nSean McDermott, the defensive coordinator for the Panthers, has put together the closest thing I have seen to our dominant 2000 Ravens defense -- impossible to run against on the inside because of the down linemen, impossible to run on to the outside because of the athletic and sure-tackling linebackers. The Achilles' heel: Carolina has given up some big plays in the secondary.\n\n\" No big runs: The front seven is superior to Denver's offensive line, so be patient and don't overrun your gap responsibility. The Broncos' big plays come on the cutback zones; if you eliminate those, they will not be able to sustain enough in the running game to beat you.\n\n\" Ballhawk like crazy: I hate to say it, but Peyton will throw enough pick-able balls for Carolina to take advantage of and win the game. Denver led the NFL in interceptions thrown and Carolina paced the league in interceptions corralled. I have not run this through the computer, but I don't think that bodes well for the Broncos.",

                    "title": "Our Pick! A Prediction For Super Bowl 50",
                    "body": "Its finally here. The moment that all of us football fans around the country have been waiting on, it's damn near Super Bowl Sunday. We've been waiting all year long to see what the final match up of the 2015-2016 NFL Season would look like, and it should certainly be an epic match-up. On one side of the field you've got Peyton Manning and his impressive Denver Bronco's, while on the other the fast, young and energetic Carolina Panthers led by Cam Newton.\n\nThis match-up pits two highly talented quarterbacks against each other. One looking to add to his collection of hardware before he puts his illustrious career to rest, while the other is looking for his first ring, and the start of what could be quite an impressive collection and legacy for himself. However this is more than just Peyton vs. Cam, this is a battle between two powerful teams, one with a defensive mindset that has prevailed week in and week out. The other, an offensive minded team who has been putting up big numbers all season long while only losing one game along the way. This is certain to be a great game, and today we provide our prediction for the big game; Super Bowl 50!\n\nWhen it comes to the offensive side of the ball, no one has been quite as proficient as the Carolina Panthers. The team averaged 31 points a game, the league's best, while also garnering over 360 total yards per game, 11th in the league and 142 rushing yards per game, the league's best. Their offense has proven deadly in all aspects over the course of the season, and was even more apparent in their routing of Cardinals for the NFC Championship. This team has definitely came into their own offensively this season, but is it enough as they go head to head against the number one ranked defense in the league. On the other side of things Denver only averaged 22 points per game, with 248 yards passing and 107 rushing yards per game; though their defense was able to keep other offenses to minimum gains and points; resulting in a 12-4 record for the season and propelling them into the biggest game of the season. This is certainly a contrast that should make for an interesting game!\n\nOn the other side of the ball, the Denver Broncos have been second to none all season long on defense. Their young, fast, powerful, and impressive, and have maintained their identity all season. Their ball hawking and aggressive ways were certainly apparent against the New England Patriots, as they intercepted and sacked Tom Brady a number of times on their way to an impressive and triumphant victory. Over the season Denver has held teams to just 18.5 points per game with 283 yards per game, stifling and frustrating some of the best offenses in the league all season. Thats under 200 yards passing and under 90 yards rushing per game for opponents, making scoring quite a tough option. On the other side of things, the Carolina Panthers offer a rather tough Defense as well. The Panthers have only allowed 19 points per game this season, while 235 yards passing and 88 yards of rushing per game along the way. Though the Panther offense has gotten a lot of the praise and attention this year, its defense is certainly nothing to sleep on. This should certainly make for a closer game than expected, and should tilt things in the favor of Denver a bit on the defensive side of things. Both teams provide exciting game play on the defensive side, which is sure to make things interesting along the way!\n\nThe quarterback battle is always of interest during Super Bowl Sunday, and Super Bowl 50 is certainly no different. On the Denver side we have an aging Peyton Manning, who certainly still has it, though he's changed his game to maintain it through the years. On the other side we've got the young buck, Cam Newton, who has certainly shown off his talents and his potential in his career, and is finally getting his chance to shine on the biggest stage yet. Peyton offers that cool, calm, collected appeal, offering up precise, controlled and effortless play. His ability to keep his composure and to make plays is second only to Tom Brady, which certainly adds an air of uncertainty in any game. Cam Newton however comes with the energy, the gall and the ability to create plays on the run and in the pocket. He's shown his ability to run, pass, and more, all while doing so with this undeniable charisma that has apparently rubbed off on his team mates. Both offer their own unique style to the position, Peyton a true student of the game and master of offense, and Cam a more aggressive, agile and athletic rendition of the modern QB. While these two certainly deserve the shot, only one can go home with the ring from Super Bowl 50!\n\nSuper Bowl 50 is certainly set up to be a great game. Both teams come with a respectable offense and defense, both teams offer up a contrasting style of play and some stunning talents on both sides of the ball. On one hand Peyton Manning is looking to end his career on the highest note possibly, while Cam Newton looks to get his first ring and begin his legacy as the next best NFL quarterback. The game is certainly set to be a good one, and definitely one we'll be tuning in for. While we'd love to see Peyton go out on top with another ring, Cam Newton and the impressive talents of the Carolina Panthers are who we are predicting to win it all. Final Score, Carolina 35, Denver 21. Let us know your thoughts on the prediction below and stay tuned for much more on Super Bowl 50 coming very soon!",

                    "title": "How Broncos will account for Panthers CB Norman",
                    "body": "In Super Bowl 48, the Broncos had a plan to avoid Richard Sherman. Will Peyton Manning pay the Panthers' cornerback the same respect?\n\nTwo years ago, Peyton Manning went into Super Bowl 48 with a specific plan to not throw at Richard Sherman when the Seahawks' All-Pro corner was in off-coverage near the sideline. Challenging the ball-hawk wasn't worth the risk.\n\nSherman was the best corner in football that season. This year, by consensus, the best corner has been the Panthers' Josh Norman. Like Sherman, Norman is primarily an off-coverage defender who plays outside in a zone scheme. Norman isn't quite the play-making threat that Sherman was in 2013, but as his four interceptions and two touchdowns this season attest, he's plenty dangerous.\n\nFalling so far behind the Seahawks in Super Bowl 48 -- they trailed 22-0 at halftime and 36-8 after three quarters -- the Broncos had to abandon their game plan and operate in a state of desperation. They never got to truly see whether or not the deliberate avoidance of Sherman was wise.\n\nManning today plays in a less vertical passing game under head coach Gary Kubiak than he did two years ago under then-offensive coordinator Adam Gase. Avoiding Norman on the perimeter would not be outlandishly disruptive to Denver's M.O., but avoiding any corner comes with the inherent cost of shrinking the field. And shrinking the field against a speedy zone defense like Carolina's can be perilous.\n\n* KING'S MMQB: Before building the Broncos into a winner, John Elway cut his teeth in player personnel by watching his father\n\nBut that doesn't mean the Broncos won't do it. Playing opposite Norman is Robert McClain, a fifth-year veteran who was added to the roster in December after injuries to Bene Benwikere and Charles Tillman thinned the cornerbacking corps. When inexperienced corners enter a lineup in midstream, defensive coordinators tend to have their corners play the same side snap after snap, in order to help that new corner get comfortable. The down side is that offenses are able to dictate matchups. Not surprisingly, Carolina's opponents have deliberately thrown at McClain on the perimeter, with plus and minus results. If the Broncos want, they can get No. 1 receiver Demaryius Thomas against him simply by aligning Thomas outside to the left side of the offense.\n\nEvery once and a while, Norman and McClain will flip sides so that Norman can match against a certain receiver. This would be Carolina's only recourse against Thomas, and it becomes null should Thomas align in the slot, where neither McClain nor Norman operate. (Those duties belong to Cortland Finnegan.) Because the Panthers are a nickel zone defense that plays five defensive backs and two linebackers -- rather than six DBs and one linebacker like dime a defense would -- the Broncos can use trips formations (three receivers aligned to the same side) to get Thomas matched against linebackers Luke Kuechly or Thomas Davis. Both are excellent cover linebackers, but not to the extent that they'd win repeated matchups against an upper echelon wide receiver.\n\nThis illustrates the value of having versatile man-to-man corners. Norman could maybe hold up in iso-man coverage, but he's not asked to do so very often and probably hasn't practiced it much. Denver's corners, on the other hand, have flourished in this capacity. Aqib Talib is limited mostly to playing the perimeter, but Bradley Roby and especially Chris Harris can work inside or outside. It's nearly impossible for offenses to dictate specific passing matchups against them.\n\nThe Panthers, however, are the only playoff team this season devoid of wideouts who are worth special defensive attention. It will be shocking if Denver's corners don't play the same side on every snap. The one Carolina pass-catcher who needs to be specifically accounted for, tight end Greg Olsen, is the one guy that none of Denver's corners can defend fulltime. Harris and Roby are too small. Talib has the size but is nowhere near strong enough in run support; you can't ask him to follow Olsen into the slot or especially all the way to a traditional line of scrimmage tight end spot because the Broncos will need linebackers and bigger safeties in this roles to defend Carolina's high-volume power running game.\n\nBoth Super Bowl offenses this year have quarterbacks who can audible into more favorable matchups at the line of scrimmage. This is what Peyton Manning has built his career on, and it's what propelled Cam Newton to likely MVP status. The Super Bowl has millions of viewers who don't usually watch football. Those viewers tend to gripe about the play-to-play stoppages. But in this contest, it's during those stoppages, in the presnap phase, where the aerial battles will be decided.",

                    "body": "John Elway, Denver Broncos General Manager and Executive Vice President of Football Operations. Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSince Peyton Manning arrived in Denver four years ago, the Broncos have consistently been a Super Bowl contender, including a trip to the big game two years in Super Bowl XLVIII against the Seattle Seahawks. But unlike that Super Bowl run, which was mainly orchestrated by Manning and a juggernaut offense, the Broncos are the 2015 AFC champions largely due to a suffocating defense and roster built with balance.\n\nThe Broncos have been very active in free agency, filling out the roster with cornerstone players like defensive end Demarcus Ware, wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders and cornerback Aqib Talib. But the NFL Draft has been a critical step to the construction of the AFC champs with 22 players on the roster that Denver drafted (two more than the Panthers), including five first-round picks. Team-building is a delicate balance between free agents and draft picks and executive vice president/general manager and Broncos legend John Elway has walked the fine line well.\n\nAnother key difference in this year's Broncos team is the coaching staff as Denver and former head coach John Fox mutually agreed to part ways after last season. To create better cohesion between the coaching staff and front office, Elway hired Gary Kubiak as head coach, another familiar face as he previously served as backup quarterback (1983-91) and offensive coordinator (1995-2005) in Denver.\n\nMEN AT THE TOP\n\nFollowing the disastrous Josh McDaniels era, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen added Elway to the front office in 2011. The move was met with skepticism as some saw the hire as a public relations move for the fans. However, it became clear very quickly that Elway was more than just a spokesman or token figure head, the Broncos were going to be built with a blueprint designed by the quarterback who won the franchise its only two Super Bowls.\n\nOnce Elway took over the day-to-day, he didn't insist on a complete overhaul of the player personnel department. Instead, he kept most of the football operations staff intact, adding several experienced decision-makers from the outside, including Tom Heckert, former general manager of the Cleveland Browns.\n\nFIVE MOVES THAT GOT THEM HERE\n\nTwo years ago, the Broncos advanced to the Super Bowl with a record-breaking offense led by Manning, but it was no match for the Seahawks No. 1-ranked defense as Seattle dominated Denver in Super Bowl XLVIII, 43-8. Having a future Hall of Fame quarterback at the helm was obviously important, but, as the old adage says, defense wins championships. A few weeks after that loss, Elway committed over $100 million in free agency to Talib, Ware and T.J. Ward and continued to focus on defensive prospects in the draft.\n\nYes, Elway is a former quarterback and offensive thinker by trade, but since he was hired as a member of the Broncos' front office in 2011, Denver has drafted a defensive player with their first pick in the draft each of the last five years and eight defensive players on the roster are former top-40 draft picks. Elway and his staff have also found several late round or undrafted gems, including cornerback Chris Harris, who has made the Pro Bowl the last two years.\n\nAnd the final piece to the puzzle was Wade Phillips, who was hired as defensive coordinator prior to the 2015 season. The year the Broncos lost to the Seahawks in the Super Bowl, the Denver defense finished 19th in the NFL. But that ranking improved to third in 2014 and No. 1 in 2015 under Phillips, leading the league in total yards allowed (283.1), sacks (52), forced fumbles (25) and defensive scores (four).\n\nCORE PLAYERS\n\nThe core of the Broncos roster is a balance of home-grown draft picks, wise free agent signings and a few undrafted discoveries.\n\nManning, Ware and Talib were all signed to lucrative free agent deals on Elway's watch, along with several other important yet under-the-radar additions like linebacker Brandon Marshall and guard Louis Vasquez (both chosen as Pro Bowl alternates in 2015). Wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and offensive tackle Ryan Clady are the two core players who were on the roster prior to Elway, although Clady missed all of the 2015 seasons due to a torn ACL.\n\nThrough the draft, the Broncos have used high draft picks to find core players, including Miller (No. 2 overall, 2011), Derek Wolfe (No. 36 overall, 2012) and Sylvester Williams (No. 28, 2013) in the defensive front-seven. And the franchise has hit on several late round or undrafted players in the bargain bin like Harris (undrafted), Malik Jackson (No. 137 overall, 2012) and Danny Trevathan (No. 188 overall, 2012).\n\nDEPTH FINDS\n\nA player who may or may not be the future of the franchise at quarterback, Brock Osweiler proved to be a valuable member of the Broncos this season, recording a 5-2 record as a starter while Manning was out with injuries. Osweiler was drafted in the second round of the 2012 NFL Draft and will be a free agent after the Super Bowl.\n\nDenver ranked middle of the pack in rushing this season, but are getting bang for their buck with undrafted running back C.J. Anderson (2013), who has rushed for 1,500-plus yards combined the last two seasons. Although neither Anderson nor Ronnie Hillman (No. 67 overall, 2012) are core players, they create a tandem backfield that gets the job done more times than not.\n\nSeveral other members of the Broncos' roster aren't household names, but have been contributors on the path to the Super Bowl. Players like pass rusher Shaquil Barrett (undrafted), cornerback Kayvon Webster (No. 90 overall, 2013) and safety David Bruton (No. 114 overall, 2009) and free agent finds like defensive tackle Vance Walker.\n\nGRADING THE DRAFT\n\nWhile free agent additions might be the backbone to the Broncos' roster, the team's success on draft weekend has been equally as important to Denver playing in Super Bowl 50.\n\nDating back to 2010, the Broncos have drafted very well with their first pick in the draft: wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (2010), linebacker Von Miller (2011), defensive tackle Derek Wolfe (2012), defensive tackle Sylvester Williams (2013), cornerback Bradley Roby (2014) and defensive end Shane Ray (2015).\n\nWith the exception of Ray, who was a nickel rusher as a rookie in 2015, the Broncos' first pick in the draft since 2010 have each been key starters on the current squad. Roby technically started only four games this past season, but his playing time is near equal to a starter due to the amount of nickel packages.\n\nThe Broncos have been far from perfect on draft weekend. They swung and missed on running back Montee Ball (No. 58 overall, 2013) and wide receiver Cody Latimer (No. 56, 2014) has taken longer than expected to develop. But Elway and his staff deserve credit for their work through the draft, especially considering they haven't drafted in the top-20 picks since 2011.\n\nFRONT OFFICE VIEW\n\nElway was a Super Bowl-winning quarterback on the field and he might be a Super Bowl-winning executive off the field if the Broncos can pull the upset over the Panthers in Super Bowl 50. And if that happens, his accomplishments as a general manager will have been earned through hard work, preparation and talent -- just like his accomplishments as a quarterback.\n\n\"Really, what I was drawing off and have been drawing off, is my experience in my career,\" Elway said. \"When we won those two Super Bowls, what was the formula? The formula was to play good defense, and offensively, it was about running the ball.\"\n\nSome will say that it doesn't take talent to open a checkbook and write down numbers and that would be correct. However, Elway has been more than an ATM or figure head -- he has had a plan since the day he took office. And while it hasn't always been pretty, that plan has the Broncos planning for the ultimate prize on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\n-Dane Brugler is a Senior Analyst for NFLDraftScout.com, distributed in partnership with The Sports Xchange and CBSSports.com.",

                    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The last time the Denver Broncos played in a Super Bowl -- to close out the 2013 season -- wide receiver Demaryius Thomas got steamrolled by Seattle Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor early in the first quarter. Thomas wobbled back to his feet and fought to 118 of the most difficult receiving yards a wideout could have in a 35-point loss.\n\nTwo years later, the Broncos stepped off their chartered flight to San Jose on Sunday afternoon, heading into the build-up for Super Bowl 50 and needing Thomas to lift his game. The Broncos have made it to the NFL's title game with their alpha wide receiver still looking to make a significant impact.\n\n\"I'll keep working,\" Thomas said. \"You always want to make plays to help us win. ... Just keep working.\"\n\nThomas, who signed a five-year, $70 million deal in the offseason, had four catches for 40 yards in the Broncos' divisional-round win over the Pittsburgh Steelers and two catches for 12 yards in the Broncos' AFC Championship Game win over the New England Patriots.\n\nAsked if he was worried about the offense if the Broncos can't get their leading receiver involved, Broncos coach Gary Kubiak stood firm in support of his 100-catch receiver.\n\n\"No, I mean I'm proud of D.T.,\" Kubiak said. \"He's worked really hard. [Patriots coach] Bill [Belichick] took him away last week. I mean I've never seen so many guys on one guy a couple of times, and that's a compliment to him, so you've got to go try to win other ways. D.T. understands that, but he's worked really hard.\"\n\nBut it is a growing trend at this point. In the Broncos' past three playoff games combined, including the divisional-round loss to the Indianapolis Colts that ended the Broncos' 2014 season, Thomas has 11 catches for 111 yards (37 yards per game) and one touchdown (in the loss against the Colts).\n\nQuarterback Peyton Manning has tried to get the ball to Thomas this postseason. He has been targeted 15 times in the Broncos' two playoff wins, or just one fewer target than Emmanuel Sanders, who has turned his 16 postseason targets into 10 receptions.\n\nBut it has been that kind of season for Thomas -- sometimes dominant, sometimes perplexing. He had a career-most 18 drops this season, including a five-drop night against the Patriots in November. His concentration has wavered in games, with the dropped passes often coming in clusters. But he also had his second consecutive 100-catch season -- his 105 receptions ranked seventh in the league -- and he had his fourth consecutive season with at least 1,300 yards receiving.\n\nThomas started 16 games for the fourth consecutive year, but has had his share of bumps and bruises that have limited him in practice. He can consistently be seen shaking his hand after catches, thanks to a finger injury.\n\nThomas' season was also marked by his mother's release from prison. Katina Smith saw Thomas play in a game for the first time in December, and she is scheduled to attend the Super Bowl. Smith went to prison for drug trafficking when Thomas was 11 years old. Her sentence pardoned by President Barack Obama in November.\n\n\"I know he'll be ready to go [in the Super Bowl],\" Kubiak said. \"I know that the fact that his mom will get a chance to be there -- I think there are a lot of things going on in his life that he's handled very, very well. I know he'll be ready to go.\"\n\n\"I really feel like it's a blessing to be here,\" Thomas said. \"I always think I can do more and I want to do more and I need to do more. But we played hard, you just keep grinding because this whole teams grinds.\"",

Despite those achievements, are the Panthers really getting the respect they deserve?\n\nDuring the regular season when they kept building each week, they may not have. Yes, Ron Rivera had a nice team, but the NFL was slow to recognize the all-around talent and depth on the Panthers.\n\nThe achievement of going 15-1 in the regular season and winning the Super Bowl would put them in glorious company. The only two teams to have done that are the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears. Both of those teams are recognized as all-time great NFL teams, and the Panthers are in the process of stating their case.\n\nWhat: Super Bowl 50\n\nWhen: Sunday, Feb. 7, 6:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, California\n\nWatch: CBS\n\nLive Stream: CBSSports.com\n\nWhile Newton is the trigger man for the offense, the Panthers have a big, powerful offensive line that have opened holes for the second-ranked Carolina running attack all season. The Panthers rushed for an average of 142.6 yards per game this season, and Jonathan Stewart gained 989 of those yards.\n\nCarolina's ability to run the ball takes pressure off of Newton and gives him the opportunity to play free-and-easy football throughout much of the season.\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nWhile Carolina gets support from its running game, the Broncos need a consistent effort from their ground game if they are going to extend this game deep into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Broncos have to run the ball because they don't have the big-play firepower in the passing game. Peyton Manning is a tactician and a field general at this point in his career, but he is not the strong-armed quarterback he was two years ago.\n\nManning threw 55 TD passes in 2013, but he had just nine TD passes while throwing 17 interceptions in the regular season.\n\nIn two postseason games, Manning has dialed it back and he has thrown two TD passes and no interceptions.\n\nThat's the way head coach Gary Kubiak wants it. If the Broncos can run the ball consistently, play hard-nosed defense with the No. 1-ranked unit in the league, then Manning won't have to attempt to do it by himself.\n\nBut if the strong-armed Newton, who had 35 touchdown passes this year, gets loose and can put a couple of scores on the board, the Broncos may be at a huge disadvantage. They don't want to see the two quarterbacks get into a passing duel at this point in their careers.\n\nThe Panthers have gotten off to excellent starts in both postseason games, and they would obviously like to do the same here.\n\nThe Broncos have been a dominant defense all season, and they can't afford any let-up here if they want to help Manning get his second Super Bowl win and possibly walk off into the sunset with the Vince Lombardi Trophy under his arm.",

Doubting the existence of \"all the doubters\"\n\n9. Injury data | 10. Media night\n\nFIRST...\n\nThe Denver Broncos' quarterback situation this season could have been a fiasco. It could have been a controversial, divisive mess.\n\nInstead, the Broncos are in the Super Bowl and Peyton Manning, even after a career-worst season, somehow has a chance to potentially make a glorious exit from the sport befitting his status as an all-time-great player.\n\n[Peyton Manning is a legendary player. He also has had one of the worst seasons ever by a QB who is starting a Super Bowl]\n\nThere are plenty of people within the Broncos organization who deserve credit for that, from the always graceful Manning to the young but already mature Brock Osweiler to the Wade Phillips-coached defense that made it all work.\n\nBut the deft touch of Broncos first-year Coach Gary Kubiak in handling all of it cannot be overlooked.\n\nWhen Broncos executive John Elway ousted former coach John Fox following a one-and-done playoff exit last season and turned to Kubiak, his one-time backup quarterback in Denver, Kubiak did not inherit an easy situation. There was no way for a seamless transition to be made.\n\n[Has John Elway given Peyton Manning a team good enough to enable Manning to possibly make an Elway-esque NFL exit?]\n\nManning is set in his ways, and rightfully so. He has been probably the finest regular season quarterback in NFL history and has rewritten a portion of the record book doing things his way, running an offense the way he likes to run it.\n\nIt just didn't quite mesh with the type of offense that Kubiak likes to run, with its emphasis on quarterback rollouts. So Kubiak adjusted. He tweaked his offense.\n\nWhen the injuries piled up and Manning's results this season were unraveling, Kubiak turned to Osweiler and gave Manning time off to heal. It never was perceived as a benching. Just when it appeared that Manning never would return to the lineup and the Broncos would be Osweiler's team, Kubiak turned to Manning during the regular season finale and went back to him as the starter for the postseason. The offense did just enough during the AFC playoffs to allow the defense to lead the way to the Super Bowl.\n\n[Wade Phillips, passed over by the Redskins and the No. 2 choice in Denver, has coached the Broncos]\n\n\"The bottom line is I know Gary and he knows what it takes,\" Elway said after the AFC title game. \"He's done a tremendous job this year with a team that when he came in here had won a lot of football games. So to be able to come in and get us back to that Super Bowl, the way that he's done that has been tremendous. Like I said, there's not a better guy for the job that could have done a better job than Gary's done this year.\"\n\nSo Manning is in another Super Bowl in a season in which he was the NFL's 34th-ranked passer. Osweiler has demonstrated that he can be a capable starter going forward. Kubiak has made it all work. And he has done so after deciding last offseason, before the Broncos came calling, that he would pass up NFL head coaching opportunities and remain in Baltimore this season as the Ravens' offensive coordinator, contentedly working for Coach John Harbaugh.\n\n\"That wasn't tough for me because this is where I grew up,\" Kubiak said of the Denver opportunity last March at the annual league meeting. \"This is my football home. I had made a decision that I was going to stay [in Baltimore]. I had actually already went out and celebrated that with my wife: We're gonna stay and we're gonna take a break here. But crazy things happen in this league.\n\n\"As far as the opportunity for me to come back to Denver and do what I'm getting the chance to do, that was a no-brainer to me. I described it that way to John and to Ozzie [Newsome, the Ravens' general manager] because I had told them that I wasn't gonna go anywhere, and then all of a sudden this happened. And I said, 'Hey, guys, this is a game-changer for me.' And they understood. They were great. That was very easy.\"\n\n... AND TEN\n\n1. The perception of Newton\n\nShoot, now I simply cannot wear my yellow zebra-print pants to the Super Bowl.\n\nCam Newton beat me to it.\n\nBut seriously, the fascination with Newton's wardrobe and the debate over his likeability, or lack of it, among fans has gone way off track. There is no legitimate debate to be had.\n\n[He smiles, dances and gives footballs to kids. So why all the hate for Cam Newton?]\n\nIt's all very simple, actually: Newton is a great player. He plays with an exuberance and an enthusiasm that anyone who loves football should appreciate.\n\nIf you don't like Newton or the way he plays, you simply need to get over it. Stop yelling at the young quarterback who actually enjoys what he's doing to get off your lawn.\n\n\"I think he's loved by the public,\" former San Francisco 49ers guard Randy Cross said in a phone interview over the weekend. \"I think the way he's perceived otherwise is shaped by crotchety old TV analysts and print-media people. To me, fans love the guy. I think to the fans, that's the way they want it in sports. That's what they want to see and what they expect whether it's [Clayton] Kershaw or LeBron [James] or Michael Phelps stripping to his Speedo for the basketball-crowd thing. There's a segment of people out there that he'll never make happy. But I don't think that segment is the majority of the fans.\"\n\nNewton spoke the other day of there being a racial component to the backlash against him. That may be true. But more than anything, it seems to be a generational thing. Newton is where the league is headed, not where it's been. He is the next big thing in the NFL. Get used to it.\n\nFormer Philadelphia Eagles and Cleveland Browns executive Joe Banner wrote on Twitter last week that two days were \"spent analyzing why Cam Newton isn't loved. I don't buy the premise. Some idiots [and] racists do not reflect the affection of the masses[.]\"\n\n2. Pro Bowl\n\nAnyone who watched the Pro Bowl on Sunday night should seek immediate help.\n\nIt isn't football. And it shouldn't be. Any player who would put his health and well-being in jeopardy by playing at anything resembling full speed in a game with nothing at stake would be crazy.\n\nThere's no risk of that, of course. The game itself continues to resemble a seven-on-seven passing drill on the practice field during offseason OTAs. The teams have become a jumbled mess not aligned with either conference. The top players don't show up. There is the Pro Bowl team; and then there is the Pro Bowl team of players actually willing to attend.\n\nBut all of that aside, so what? The NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell have tried to \"fix\" the Pro Bowl. Goodell once threatened to eliminate it if the quality didn't improve. Once again this year, there was some talk about getting rid of the game. But why? Viewership numbers are good. Some people actually watch it. The NFL should be pleased and perhaps bewildered by that, and just leave things alone.\n\n3. Calvin Johnson's decision\n\nWide receiver Calvin Johnson and the Detroit Lions announced after the season that Johnson was contemplating retirement.\n\nESPN took it a step further with its report Sunday that Johnson told family members, teammates and the Lions that he would retire after this season. Now it appears that it will take a last-minute change of heart for Johnson to return and play.\n\nJohnson is not the player that he once was. But he remains a highly productive receiver. If he does pull a Barry Sanders and walks away from the Lions with good seasons left in him, it would be a setback and a disappointment not only for the franchise, but for everyone who likes to see football played at the highest possible level.\n\n[Would Calvin Johnson really pull a Barry Sanders and walk away from the Lions?]\n\nYet no one should be entirely surprised. Johnson has had a superb career. He has made a lot of money. He is set for life financially and he has proven himself professionally. With the toll that football takes on a body, no one should be shocked any more when players -- even great players -- walk away.\n\n4. T.O. and the Hall\n\nThere is much hand-wringing over the Pro Football Hall of Fame candidacy of wide receiver Terrell Owens in his first year of eligibility for enshrinement.\n\nFormer Rams coach Mike Martz decried the fact that Owens is a Hall of Fame finalist while two former St. Louis wideouts, Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce, are not.\n\nLet's make this easy: Terrell Owens is a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nEnd of discussion.\n\nCheck the NFL's list of career leaders in receiving yards. There is Jerry Rice first, and Terrell Owens second.\n\nThink what you want about the guy, but it's foolish to argue that he should not go directly to Canton. Yes, he was a high-maintenance diva. So was Brett Favre. Is anyone claiming that should keep Favre from being elected this weekend? Of course not. And it shouldn't prevent Owens from being selected Saturday, either. It's not the Hall of People We Like.\n\nThere are some players who don't have to wait their turn. There are some players where you simply say, \"He's a Hall of Famer,\" and then worry later about who else gets in that particular year.\n\nFavre is such a player this year.\n\nBut so, too, is Owens.\n\n5. Bowlen won't attend\n\nLongtime Broncos owner Pat Bowlen reportedly will not attend the Super Bowl.\n\nBowlen is dealing with Alzheimer's disease and surrendered day-to-day oversight over the franchise in 2014. Joe Ellis, the team's president and chief executive officer, addressed Broncos players Saturday about Bowlen.\n\nBowlen was not on the podium after the Broncos won the AFC championship game. But his wife Annabel was there.\n\n\"That's what it's all about, and especially to do it here, do it in front of our fans,\" Elway said in the Broncos' locker room following the triumph over the New England Patriots. \"To be able to stand up there, to me that makes everything we do, all the work, worthwhile.... Unfortunately Mr. B can't be there. But it's great to have Annabel and the whole family up there.\"\n\n6. Chargers' decision\n\nThe Chargers' decision to remain in San Diego for the 2016 season, rather than joining the Rams in Los Angeles, is interesting. It gives the Rams a head start in L.A., potentially relegating the Chargers to being the No. 2 team in town if they indeed opt to become the second resident in the palatial Inglewood, Calif., stadium scheduled to open in 2019.\n\n[Chargers are staying put for 2016 season but have tentative stadium deal with Rams in place]\n\nBut the decision, announced Friday by Chairman Dean Spanos, also gives the Chargers maximum leverage in their dealings with political leaders in San Diego about a new stadium, and shifts the blame away from the team if it eventually leaves.\n\nThe pressure now is on San Diego to make its last, best pitch for a new stadium. The deadline is clear. The Chargers are halfway out the door. Whatever happens, they can say that they allowed the push for a stadium solution in San Diego to go into overtime.\n\n7. Raiders and Las Vegas\n\nThe latest suitor for the Raiders has emerged with the news that owner Mark Davis met Friday with Sheldon Adelson, the chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands, about the possibility of a stadium being built there.\n\nThe NFL has no rule prohibiting a team from relocating to any particular city. But given the way the league has distanced itself from sports gambling, it seems highly unlikely that a franchise moving to Las Vegas ever would be ratified.\n\nStill, the Raiders are keeping their options open, and they have plenty of them. They can continue to seek a new stadium in Oakland, armed with an additional $100 million to put toward a facility there courtesy of the owners' vote last month in which the Rams' L.A. relocation was approved.\n\nThe Raiders would inherit the Chargers' option to join the Rams in Inglewood if it is not exercised by the Chargers within a year. The Raiders previously have explored the possibility of moving to San Antonio, Tex. St. Louis is now without a franchise. San Diego would be without a team if the Chargers exit for the 2017 season.\n\nShouldn't the Raiders be able to land a stadium deal somewhere?\n\n8. Proving all those doubters wrong\n\nThe Broncos and Panthers each resorted to the \"no one thought we could do it\" approach following the conference championship games.\n\n\"Everybody said we couldn't cover,\" Denver cornerback Chris Harris said in the locker room after the win over the Patriots. \"They said I couldn't cover [wide receiver Julian] Edelman. They said we couldn't cover all week. They said they were gonna shred us all week. So that made us angry. We had it written up every day. That gave us motivation.... I wanted to come out here and prove a point.\"\n\nNewton told Fox following the NFC title game: \"This team, we won as a team. We came out here and fought our tails off. We did what a lot of people said we couldn't do. It's not over yet.\"\n\nJust a couple points:\n\nFirst, did anyone really think there was absolutely no chance that the Broncos' defense, ranked first in the league during the regular season, and the Panthers, who have lost exactly once all season, could have success?\n\nAnd second, just to balance things out, at least one player in a losing locker room should say, \"No one thought we could win. And you know what? Everyone was right.\"\n\n9. Other injury data\n\nThe major news coming out of the NFL's release Friday of its injury data for this season focused on the sharp increase in the number of reported concussions suffered by players.\n\nLeague medical officials said further study is needed to determine whether the increase, from 206 last season to 271 this season, is attributable to more concussions being detected and reported via increased awareness and more diligent screening, or to an actual increase in the number of head injuries being suffered by players.\n\n[Reported concussions suffered by NFL players were up sharply this season]\n\nThe league also released data related to the number of knee injuries suffered by players.\n\nACL sprains were up slightly this season. There were 56 ACL sprains suffered by players this season, according to the data, compared to 49 last season. But that was fewer than the 62 ACL sprains suffered by players in the 2013 season and the 63 suffered in 2012.\n\nThere was a more significant increase in MCL sprains. According to the data, players suffered 170 MCL sprains this season, up from 139 such injuries last season. There were 136 MCL sprains in the 2013 season and 132 in 2012.\n\nThe data also showed that for a fourth straight year, the overall injury rate was lower in Thursday night games than it was in Sunday and Monday night games.\n\n10. Media night\n\nThose who just can't wait for media day during Super Bowl week are being rewarded this year.\n\nThe NFL has scrapped the traditional Tuesday media day. In its place this year is a media night, being dubbed \"Opening Night\" by the league, on Monday. It comes in prime time -- 8 p.m. -- on the East Coast.\n\nThe other significant change to the pre-Super Bowl gab-fest is the elimination of the Friday news conferences for the coaches. So Kubiak and the Panthers' Ron Rivera will be pretty much done with their media obligations Thursday.",

                    "body": "It should have been obvious all week, when nearly every football fan walking down the streets was clad in dark blue and lime green. But it didn't register.\n\nIt certainly should have been clear on the way to the game, where people decked out in uniforms more legit than the ones Steve Largent and Jim Zorn donned back in the '80s outnumbered those in orange and blue by at least a three-to-one margin. But even that didn't sink in.\n\nIn fact, up until the first play of Super Bowl XLVIII in New York (really New Jersey), no one had any idea how much of a pro-Seahawks crowd would be on hand at MetLife Stadium. But the moment Peyton Manning stood behind Manny Ramirez for the first time, it sounded like all of the Pacific Northwest had made the trip to the Big Apple.\n\nAt that point, or perhaps seconds later when the ball sailed over Manning's head and into the end zone for a safety, it became painfully obvious that for the first time in recent memory, one team would have a home-field advantage in the Super Bowl. And it wasn't the one designated by the league as the \"home\" team, nor was it the one wearing their primary jerseys. It was the Seahawks, based solely on the sheer dominance their fans showed in the stands.\n\nTwo years ago, that fact, especially given that it seemed to shock the under-prepared Broncos, sent the game careening toward disaster from the opening snap. This time around, Denver needs to flip the script; they need to be the ones that are getting some help from the folks in the stands.\n\nIt's time for their fans to answer the bell. The Broncos need them now more than ever.\n\nDuring the regular season, Wade Phillips and Company were able to stymie some of the best offenses in football. In order to do so, they also kept some of the league's top quarterbacks in check.\n\nAaron Rodgers rolled into the Mile High City with a perfect 6-0 record, his Packers firing on all cylinders in the early part of the season. He left with a loss that derailed Green Bay's season, the result of his worst performance (14-of-22, 77 yards) as a pro.\n\nBen Roethlisberger came to Denver in the playoffs with perhaps the best offense in the AFC; his Steelers were tops in the conference in yards per game (395.4) and second only to New England in average points (26.4). The quarterback went home on the wrong end of a 23-16 score.\n\nAnd Tom Brady visited the Broncos with all of his weapons in tow, a combination of talent that had been virtually unbeatable this season when on the field together. The reigning Super Bowl MVP left town bruised and battered, having endured 20-plus hits while putting only 18 points on the scoreboard.\n\nThose are three impressive performances. For one defense to shut down all three of those offenses in one season, making a trio of the NFL's best quarterbacks look wholly average in the process, proves that the Broncos are legit on that side of the football.\n\nBut those games all had one thing in common: They were played at Sports Authority Field. And the impact of that can't be understated.\n\nDenver's defense feeds off the energy of 76,000-plus screaming their support. It's what provides the extra boost that elevates their game to another level.\n\nIn part, this is because the Broncos pass rush is enhanced by crowd noise. Von Miller is deadly off the edge when the opposing tackles can't hear the snap count, getting a split second jump that helps him get to the quarterback.\n\nAnd it's also due to the fact that the opposition has trouble making calls at the line of scrimmage; they can't change plays very easily when they can't communicate. That makes offenses less versatile, which gives Denver an edge.\n\nIf the Broncos are going to win Super Bowl 50, they are most likely going to do it on the back of their defense; that has been the group that has carried them all season long. So to increase the chances of that happening, Denver needs the X-factor present that has helped push that unit to new heights throughout the season.\n\nOn Super Bowl Sunday, Carolina blue can't outnumber Broncos orange. The audience needs to be a partisan crowd, one tilted as far toward Denver as possible.\n\nWhich means there is only one goal in mind this week: Get to Santa Clara.\n\nBuy a travel package and go in style. Hitchhike and scalp a ticket right before kickoff. Or something in-between.\n\nDo whatever it takes to be inside Levi's Stadium on the afternoon of Feb. 7, decked out in orange and screaming with every ounce of energy. Don't wait for next time; there's no time like the present.",

                    "body": "Miller had 2.5 sacks, an interception in coverage and was a force the entire day. His play this week will be huge if the Broncos are to slow down the Carolina offense.\n\nThat's why I made him the top player in my rankings of the Super Bowl 50 starters. He got a slight edge over Carolina quarterback Cam Newton, who will be the NFL MVP -- and got my vote for that honor.\n\nNewton has been fantastic this year and is clearly more valuable to his team than Miller is to his -- quarterbacks always are -- but I chose Miller as the top player because I think he tops the list of edge rushers in the league. Newton isn't the best quarterback, although he's in the conversation.\n\nThis list is made up of 46 players because I included the nickel corners for both teams. They are like starters these days, being on the field for 63-percent or more of the defensive snaps. I also included all three of the starting linebackers. There are no kickers or punters.\n\nSome interesting things of note about the list:\n\nThere are eight defensive players in the top 10, including five Broncos.\n\nThe only two offensive players are from Carolina, Newton and tight end Greg Olsen.\n\nDenver has eight defensive players in the top 20, while Carolina has five.\n\nThe Broncos don't have an offensive lineman ranked in the top 20. Carolina's highest-ranked offensive lineman is center Ryan Kalil at No. 11. But both their guards are also in the top 20.\n\nDenver quarterback Peyton Manning is ranked 23rd, but his impact on the game will be much higher than that. PS: It's strange to put him that low, but based on his season that's where he belongs.\n\nSo dive in and take a look. I'm sure there will be plenty of complaints.\n\n1. Von Miller, OLB, Broncos: He showed in the AFC Championship Game how he can dominate. Edge rushers are so valuable in big games. He's the best in this game.\n\n2. Cam Newton, QB, Panthers: He has grown up as a quarterback and a person. It shows. He can now stand in the pocket and make the reads. He's a star.\n\n3. Luke Kuechly, MLB, Panthers: He is a tackling machine who can also play well in coverage. He will be big in this one if Denver tries to run it.\n\n4. Kawann Short, DT, Panthers: Why so high? The tape doesn't lie. This kid has developed into a force inside with 11 sacks this season. What a great pick in the second round in 2013.\n\n5. Chris Harris Jr., CB, Broncos: Do they come any tougher? He played the title game with a shoulder that was really banged up. He's great at playing in the slot and taking away that part of an offense.\n\n6. Josh Norman, CB, Panthers: This free agent to be is about to be a rich man. He can play in zone or handle man if asked. He is tall and athletic.\n\n7. Greg Olsen, TE, Panthers: He is Newton's go-to guy in the passing game and has developed into a downfield threat. He must be handled if Denver is going to win.\n\n8. Malik Jackson, DE, Broncos: He plays the run well and he can rush the passer. There is great value in a down player who can pressure the way he does.\n\n9. DeMarcus Ware, OLB, Broncos: He is playing on a sore knee, but still remains an effective pass rusher. Did you see him in the fourth quarter of the title game?\n\n10. Aqib Talib, CB, Broncos: He remains a quality cover player who can do a lot of things. Would it shock to see him on Greg Olsen some?\n\n11. Ryan Kalil, C, Panthers: He is the best offensive lineman in the game. He gives Carolina a heady inside player to go with two young, talented guards.\n\n12. Demaryius Thomas, WR, Broncos: I know he has had some drops and hasn't been the star we've expected to see this season, but he's still a capable No. 1 receiver.\n\n13. Thomas Davis, LB, Panthers: He broke his arm in the title game, but might be back for this one. He is a steady player who can run, despite having three knee surgeries.\n\n14. Derek Wolfe, DE, Broncos: The Broncos re-signed him this month for a reason. He's a rising power player on their line. He can also push the pocket.\n\n15. Trai Turner, G, Panthers: He was named to the Pro Bowl after an impressive season inside. He is strong in the run game, but can also do a nice job in pass protection.\n\n16. Star Lotulelei, DT, Panthers: This former first-round pick missed time early in the season, and struggled some. But he's back to being a good player next to Short.\n\n17. Emmanuel Sanders, WR, Broncos: His production has been down this season in the new offense, but he is still more than capable of making big plays down the field. If the Panthers focus on Thomas, it could be a big game for Sanders.\n\n18. Andrew Norwell, G, Panthers: He has really emerged as a top-flight guard this season. He is aggressive and really excels in the run game.\n\n19. Danny Trevathan, LB, Broncos: He will be a free agent this spring, so this is another chance to show what he can do. He is a speed linebacker who is asked to do a lot in coverage.\n\n20. Brandon Marshall, LB, Broncos: He can run and cover and is good in the run game. He has been one of the pleasant surprises the past two years for the Denver defense.\n\n21. Jonathan Stewart, RB, Panthers: When he's been on the field, he's put up big numbers. Injuries limited his numbers some this season.\n\n22. Charles Johnson, DE, Panthers: He missed eight games, which hurt their pass rush, but he's back playing at a high level. He's had sacks in each of the past two games.\n\n23. Peyton Manning QB, Broncos: He isn't close to what he used to be as a passer, which is why he's down this low. But that mind is still lethal. You don't fool him much.\n\n25. Bradley Roby, Nickel, Broncos: This former first-round pick has emerged as a quality corner. He is long and does a nice job in man coverage. On any other team, he's a starter, not the nickel.\n\n26. Mike Remmers, T, Panthers: He's better in the run game, but this will be a week where pass protection by the tackles will be key. He's improved the past two years.\n\n27. T.J. Ward, S, Broncos: He got dinged in the title game, but is expected to play with a sore ankle. He can slide into the box or play in the deep middle. I think he's better closer to the line.\n\n28. C.J. Anderson, RB, Broncos: He is Denver's leading rusher and had a solid game against New England. He might need to come up big this week. Injuries slowed him this season.\n\n29. Darian Stewart, S, Broncos: He got banged up in the AFC Championship Game with a knee injury, but he is expected to play this week. He's been a nice addition to their defense this season.\n\n32. Shaq Thompson, LB, Panthers: This rookie linebacker brings another speed element to the Carolina defense.\n\n33. Kony Ealy, DE, Panthers: With Jared Allen missing last week's game, Ealy stepped in and started. He's been a nice rotation player all season long and has five sacks.\n\n34. Devin Funchess, WR, Panthers: After a slow start to his season, he has come on in the second half. He has flashed big-play potential in the second half of the season.\n\n35. Louis Vasquez, G, Broncos: He has settled back in at guard after playing right tackle last season. He's not to the level he once was, but he's a solid player.\n\n36. Kurt Coleman, S, Panthers: He had two picks last week and has improved in coverage from earlier in his career. He's also solid in the run game.\n\n37. Mike Tolbert, FB, Panthers: As far as fullbacks go, he's one of the best. He's a good lead blocker and he can catch it when needed.\n\n38. Michael Oher, T, Panthers: He has held up pretty well at times this season, even if he isn't close to being the player many thought he would be coming out of college. He will have his hands full this week.\n\n41. Corey Brown, WR, Panthers: He showed some big-play speed against Arizona with an 83-yard touchdown catch. He can stretch a defense.\n\n42. Sylvester Williams, NT, Broncos: He starts on the nose, but didn't play that much last week against New England. He will play more against Carolina.\n\n46. Michael Schofield, RT, Broncos: At times this season, he has been a turnstile. He might have major problems protecting Peyton Manning this week.",

The Carolina Panthers aren't interested in storybook endings, and they hope to spoil Manning's potential going away party in Super Bowl 50 on Sunday (KOIN-6 (CBS), 3:30 p.m. PT/6:30 p.m. ET).\n\nManning, 39, could play the final game of his soon-to-be Hall of Fame career. Manning is hoping to end his 18th and possibly final season with a second Super Bowl win. Despite his gaudy regular season statistics, Manning's career has been defined by a so-so record in the playoffs, including a 1-2 record in the Super Bowl. Manning needs to add a second Super Bowl title to cement his legacy as one the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.\n\nThe Broncos don't expect Manning to win the game, they just want him to manage the game, not make mistakes and lean on the team's top-ranked defense. The Denver defense possesses a ferocious pass rush, led by edge rushers Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware. The ability to pressure the quarterback with a three- or four-man rush allows the defense to use a variety of coverages.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers are trying to produce their own happy ending to a historic season. They were the best team in the NFL during the regular season and are looking to win the first Super Bowl game in franchise history.\n\nLed by quarterback Cam Newton, the Panthers use a punishing running game behind running back Jonathan Stewart to set the tone. The Panthers have jumped out to big first-half leads in victories against Seattle and Arizona in the playoffs.\n\nThe Panthers possess a tough and opportunistic defense. The defense led the league in takeaways with 39 during the regular season and they have continued in forcing turnovers in the playoffs. The Panthers, led by linebacker Luke Kuechly's Pick-6 interceptions (one in each playoff game) have forced nine turnovers in the playoffs.\n\nIf you want to watch the Broncos and Panthers in Super Bowl 50, here's what you need to know:",

If you've got a routine, keep the same routine and don't get caught up with everything around you. There are a ton of distractions and it'd be easy to go in another direction. You've got to stay focused and continue to do exactly what you've been doing.\"\n\nThe Broncos and Panthers landed in San Jose on Sunday and got right to work for Super Bowl 50 at their respective facilities in the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nWhile both teams will try to keep their attention on the task at hand, it won't be easy. The Super Bowl is the most media-saturated sporting event in the world and players will have to field questions from reporters they've never before seen from media outlets from all over the world. The fiasco begins with Monday's \"Opening Night,\" which has replaced Tuesday as media day.\n\n\"One thing you have to do is stay focused,\" said wide receiver Kevin Norwood, who was on Seattle's Super Bowl team last year. \"Once you get down there, a lot of people try to grab you to get autographs or interviews, want you to do a lot of stuff. It's going to be hectic with a lot of celebrities. It's pretty amazing. The week is going to be crazy. My advice to these guys is to stay focused. We're going out there for a business trip. Enjoy it, but stay focused.\"\n\nSuper Bowl 50 is the first time two quarterbacks selected No. 1 overall will face off in the NFL's championship game. Should the Broncos win, Peyton Manning can become the first quarterback in NFL history to start and win a Super Bowl with two different teams. If the Panthers win, Cam Newton would join Roger Staubach and Jim Plunkett as the only Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl.\n\nMORE: How the Broncos were built\n\nThe Broncos will practice this week at Stanford while the Panthers will use the facilities at San Jose State. Using the college facilities will give practices a training camp feel and the goal remains the same from last summer when the teams opened camp -- win the Super Bowl.\n\n\"It's a business trip,\" Broncos linebacker Shaquil Barrett said Sunday. \"It's no vacation. We're going out there to work and get the job done.\"\n\nMost of the game plan installation was done last week and this week's practices will be more about fine-tuning and studying as their normal week routine is disrupted.\n\nBefore leaving Colorado, the Broncos players listened to team president and CEO Joe Ellis give a heartfelt speech about owner Pat Bowlen, who is battling Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"I had Joe talk to the football team before we called it a week about Mr. B, how he's doing and how he'd be very proud of this football team,\" Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. \"It was a very good moment.\n\n\"Mr. B was one of us. I mean he was around here at practice, he was in the weight room and he was one of us. Mr. B always hired good people and he let them do their job. He supported you all the way.\"\n\nBroncos director of pro personnel Tom Heckert, who helped the team sign T.J. Ward, DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib, Emmanuel Sanders, Darian Stewart, Owen Daniels, Jordan Norwood, Ryan Harris and Vance Walker, did not make the trip to the Super Bowl because of \"a very treatable blood disorder.\"\n\nAlmost every Panthers employee, aside from a skeleton crew of part-time security staff, flew from Charlotte to California, courtesy of team owner Jerry Richardson.\n\nPanthers center Ryan Kalil grew up in California and said he's looking forward to trip out west.\n\n\"This is what we worked so hard for, to be in this game,\" Kalil said Sunday. \"Now it's here, but we still have some work to do.\"",

                    "title": "The Broncos have to rethink their pass rush to against Cam Newton",
                    "body": "The Denver Broncos defensive front made life a living hell for Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in the AFC Championship. Outside linebackers Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware provided constant pressure around the horn. Inside rushers Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson dominated the Patriots' guards to the point where Brady usually had nowhere to move that wouldn't put him in harm's way. As a unit, along with backups like Shane Ray, Shaquil Barrett, Antonio Smith and Vance Walker, the Broncos put on one of the more dominating playoff performances that I've ever seen. As close as that game ended up being and the fact that it went down to the wire has convinced me that any lesser performance from those guys may well have changed the ultimate outcome.\n\nLooking ahead to the Super Bowl matchup against the Carolina Panthers and their ridiculously physically gifted quarterback Cam Newton, I'm sure fans are wondering if the Broncos pass rushers can have a repeat performance of what they did to Brady.\n\nYeah, no.\n\nNo, they can not have the same kind of performance against Newton because of the kind of quarterback he is and the kind of passing offense the Panthers run, which tends to over emphasize protecting the quarterback.\n\nThat does not preclude the Broncos from getting a performance from their defensive front that will be good enough to help Denver win the game. They can get enough pressure on Newton to make a difference, but they are going to have to go about it differently.\n\nNormally what opposing defensive fronts do to account for mobile quarterbacks is to go to more of a power-rush game plan across the board so they can restrict running lanes inside. It isn't that forcing them to run outside is necessarily a better option, but if a mobile quarterback is able to take off straight ahead, well, you know how they say the quickest route between two points is a straight line?\n\nIt is especially dangerous to let Newton take off up the inside because that dude is every bit of 6'5 and 250 pounds, which is taller and heavier than all but one of the Broncos' inside linebackers (Brandon Marshall). Let's just say if Cam gets up a full head of steam into the secondary, it could get real ugly for the those guys. Also if you have good bull rushers, and the Broncos do, those guys can, at least in theory, escape off those bull rushes when they see Cam break contain and, again, in theory, take him down easier when he is running laterally.\n\nThe Broncos also like to run more pass-rush games, specifically TEX games (defensive tackle penetrates upfield in the B gap, edge rushers takes a couple steps upfield outside then loops inside the defensive tackle) when facing mobile quarterbacks as a way to get safe pressure while also covering the running lanes inside. Any time you get pass rushers exchanging lanes there is a chance somebody on the opposing offensive line will have a brain fart and just let a guy go, so it's usually a viable strategy.\n\nThis is basically the same game plan the Broncos utilized against the Steelers in the divisional round of the playoffs because they were also concerned with Ben Roethlisberger's mobility. Big Ben has always been good at moving around the pocket. If he can get five yards by taking off running when everybody is covered, he will take it, which of course teams have to account for. That made it harder to get constant pressure the way they did against the Patriots, but the Broncos' front was still good enough as a unit to get three sacks as well as other hurries. It's not exactly splitting the atom here; it's basically the same standard operating procedure against mobile quarterbacks that most teams try to employ.\n\nI'm not exactly sure that's the right approach to take with Cam Newton. He is just too much of an anomaly to expect the same things to work on him. Yeah, it's true if your edge rushers get way upfield trying to rush him he is likely going to burn the rest of the defense by taking off running up one of the inside lanes those deep pass rushes left open.\n\nAt the same, and this is very important, his offensive line now completely understands how most defensive fronts are going to try to attack them. You see those guys across the board basically sitting down and waiting for bull rushes, inside moves and pass rush games while not giving the slightest fuck about wide edge rushers.\n\nIt's almost comical how top heavy Panthers left tackle Michael Oher gets at times while taking his pass set at this point. I say comical because against good edge rushers who can beat you outside, offensive tackles are usually taught to keep their weight back when they punch. If they should happen to miss with their punch while keeping their weight back they can still recover against a good speed rush if they have good footwork. However, if they don't sit back and instead lean forward into their punch, good edge rushers will knock their hands down and leave them in their dust.\n\nOher and just about all the other Panthers offensive linemen almost dare pass rushers to try outside moves with how hard they sit down on bull rushes and inside moves. However, as I pointed out before, few ever actually try them because most teams are so busy preaching what?\n\nBull rushes, inside moves and pass-rush games.\n\nMiller and Ware are fucking virtuosos when it comes to turning the corner on offensive tackles; you can ask Tom Brady if you don't believe me. While they can be decent bull rushers, it would be silly to waste their pass-rushing talents by having them running down the middle of Oher and Panthers right tackle Mike Remmers all night long. Bigger than that, if they are not allowed to use their tremendous get-off to get Oher and Remmers bailing out of their stances, Miller and Ware aren't going to be nearly as effective as usual. They can usually catch an offensive tackle still going backwards and just use their momentum against them to knock them off balance on a bull rush, but I don't see them being able to do that if Oher and Remmers are allowed to just sit there on the line of scrimmage and damn near run block because they know the bull rush is coming. It just isn't bound to end well.\n\nSo, what should they do since this seems like a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation?\n\nMy advice is that they line up in a 3-4 look as much as possible with a zero nose and two three-techniques. Then, let Miller and Ware run wild around the edges all damn game. Mind you the \"zero nose\" doesn't always have to literally be a nose tackle. They can also stick a linebacker there, let him hit the center then act as a spy on Newton in the middle while the Broncos secondary plays man-to-man.\n\nLet me make sure I say this clearly because really and truly, it's the ability of their secondary to matchup well one-on-one with Carolina's skill position players across the board that would allow the traditional 3-4 alignment work for the Broncos. That alignment would also allow the Broncos to play assignment football against any read option plays or quarterback running plays that the Panthers might employ without having to worry about their secondary, save maybe one safety, having to be all that involved in stopping the run.\n\nThe Broncos tend to line up in a traditional 3-4 alignment most games anyway, so it wouldn't be much of a stretch.\n\nI would also send five or more rushers as much as possible, even when the Broncos aren't in a 3-4 alignment. If you go back and look at the NFC Championship, the Cardinals actually did do some good things on defense. They even got some pressure on Newton a time or two. What you notice is that when they did get pressure, they were usually in a traditional 3-4 alignment with the B gaps covered and often times sending an extra rusher or two.\n\nThe pass-rush games will help too, but the problem is they lack effectiveness when the edge rushers aren't using speed rushes. With a four-man rush, you are always going to have to worry about Newton taking off and running because you will always be at least a gap short. Hell, the Cardinals were doing a good job of restricting the passing lanes with the sop of bull rushes. The one time when they slipped up and got upfield on a third-and-10 in the fourth quarter, the Panthers ran a quarterback draw and Cam picked up 14 yards. The Broncos can't blitz every play, but damned if I wouldn't blitz early and often if I were the one calling the shots. Their secondary can handle it, and it's going to be necessary to make Cam uncomfortable trying to throw the ball.\n\nEven then the Broncos aren't guaranteed of getting Newton on the ground, but at least it will give them more of a chance to do so.\n\nThe only question in my mind is if the Broncos will actually adjust what they did against the Steelers to look a little more like what I described. I can't see them getting enough pressure on Cam if Miller and Ware are bull rushing all game.\n\nWhen I look back at the second half of their second game against the Chiefs this year, what I said they need looks really familiar. Ware didn't play in that game, so it wasn't quite as effective against Kansas City as they will need it to be against Carolina. Still, Miller was damn near unblockable after halftime when he started taking more chances around the corner. Even though the Chiefs blew their doors off because Peyton Manning sucked ass, there were still some positives to take from how they rushed Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith, another guy who is pretty mobile, in the second half.\n\nAdditionally the Titans, who sacked Newton a season-high (for him) five times, lined up in a 3-4 alignment on three out of those five sacks and sent five or more rushers on all five.\n\nDon't let the final score fool you, the same Tennessee Titans that only won three games were breathing down the Panthers' necks headed into the fourth quarter with the score just 17-10. That's one film I would be pouring over if I were Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips.\n\nIf Phillips lets his edge rushers do what they do best and combines it with a middle spy or extra rushers most of the game, I could definitely see Ware and Miller exposing Oher and Remmers for the average tackles that they really are and getting Newton down on the ground repeatedly. I just can't be sure if he Phillips will go with that game plan and anything less than that truly may not be enough for the Broncos to win.",

                    "body": "The Carolina Panthers are strong six-point favorites over the Denver Broncos as Super Bowl week begins in earnest.\n\nHead coach Ron Rivera's team may not have gotten its due until the last week or two despite a 15-1 regular-season record, but there can be no denying how talented and explosive the Panthers are after two significant postseason victories.\n\nThe Panthers scored 31 first-half points and put away the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional playoffs, and while they had a problem in the second half of that game, the Panthers were never in danger of losing in a 31-24 decision.\n\nThey were even better against the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game as they rolled to a 49-15 blowout. Prior to the start of the playoffs, Seattle and Arizona appeared to be the two hottest teams in the league outside of the Panthers.\n\nThe power of the Panthers' two wins over high-quality opponents is one of the reasons the Super Bowl betting line has gone from an opening 3.5-point spread to its current number.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 Game Line Over/Under Selection Denver Broncos vs. Carolina Panthers Car. (-6) 45 Carolina; Over\n\nOdds Shark; Silverman selection\n\nThe Broncos simply don't have the kind of offensive firepower with Peyton Manning at quarterback to match Cam Newton and the Panthers. The Broncos fully realize that Manning, who was once a dominant gunslinger and one of the finest quarterbacks in the history of the NFL, is no longer that kind of player.\n\nThe numbers bear this out, as Manning played in just 10 regular-season games this year (starting nine of them) and compiled a 9-17 TD-to-interception ratio. Those numbers provide strong evidence of Manning's decline, but so does the wobble on his passes when trying to throw a 15- or 20-yard out pattern -- or anything downfield.\n\nThe Broncos have had the best defense in the league this year, and they have held the No. 1 ranking consistently from the early part of the season. That defense was at its best in the AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots. They held Tom Brady in check and came up with a key interception on the two-point conversion in the final seconds that would have allowed New England to tie the score and send the game into overtime.\n\nThe Denver defense will have to come up with an even better game here, because the Broncos are not getting the Panthers on their home field. They are getting Carolina in Super Bowl 50 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, and not having home-field advantage hurts the Broncos.\n\nCarolina may not have the top-ranked defense, but the Panthers ranked sixth in yards allowed and fourth against the run.\n\nCharlie Riedel/Associated Press Denver RB C.J. Anderson\n\nThat last factor is vital because the Broncos want to establish a running game against Carolina. If head coach Gary Kubiak's team can run the ball, it takes pressure off of Manning and will keep the Carolina offense off the field. If the running game with C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman can make Luke Kuechly and Kawann Short do extra work, that will help Denver considerably.\n\nWhile the passing game is no longer Manning's strength, the Panthers have been vulnerable through the air from time to time. They ranked 11th in passing yards allowed, and their secondary has had a few lapses. Cornerback Josh Norman is one of the best and most aggressive cover men in the league, but the rest of the secondary is suspect.\n\nAdditionally, the status of linebacker Thomas Davis is questionable. Davis had surgery on his arm last week, and while he wants to play, he may not be able to do so effectively. His absence or ineffectiveness would be a huge blow for the Panthers.\n\nPrediction\n\nThis is a difficult assignment for Manning, and it could result in a painful game for the Broncos. The Panthers are not quite the defensive juggernaut the Seattle Seahawks were two years ago in their Super Bowl XLVIII victory over the Broncos, but the Panthers have a hard-hitting and punishing defense.\n\nAdditionally, if the Broncos fall behind by double digits at any point, they will be forced to play catch-up, and that means putting the ball in the air and getting away from the ground game.\n\nThat could be disastrous because Kuechly and Norman can play the role of ball hawks as well as anyone.\n\nLook for the Broncos to be prepared and play a tough, hard game. However, they don't have enough weapons to compete for the full 60 minutes, and the Panthers will pull away in the fourth quarter and earn the Vince Lombardi Trophy as a result of their 33-14 victory.\n\nStats courtesy of CBSSports.com.

                    "body": "The Super Bowl has long been a paradise for those who love to wager on the NFL game.\n\nActually, Super Bowl betting is not restricted to those who are football fans. The game is so big that it attracts those with a casual interest and nonfootball fans as well, with the latter watching for the commercials, celebrities and trends that are set at the big game.\n\nThere are betting opportunities for everyone, including those nonfootball fans. They can bet on the length of the national anthem, the results of the coin toss or the color of the Gatorade that will drench the head of the winning coach.\n\nOf course, there are many more conventional bets available to those who have an interest in wagering on the game.\n\nStart off with the most basic of all NFL-related bets, the point spread.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers are six-point favorites over the Denver Broncos, according to Odds Shark. That line appears to have steadied at this point after moving sharply in favor of the Panthers in the first few days after the original 3.5-point line was announced.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 Game Point Spread Over/Under Money line Denver Broncos vs. Carolina Panthers Car. (-6) 45 Denver +172; Carolina -197\n\nOdds Shark\n\nThe other betting staple of the football season is the over/under, regularly referred to as the total. That number has been fairly level at 45, and it does not seem likely to change much before kickoff at Levi's Stadium on February 7 at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nFans who are only interested in picking the winner of the game without concerning themselves with the point spread can make a bet on the money line. Fans who want to back the favored Panthers have to risk $197 to win $100, while Broncos backers will bet $100 to win $172.\n\nProp bets are offered throughout the NFL season, but they multiply dramatically in the Super Bowl. Sportsbooks in Las Vegas may make as many as 500 props or more available to bettors who want to test their knowledge of the game and each team's personnel.\n\nThe coin toss is a perfect example of a Super Bowl prop bet that could get the nonfootball fan involved. Bettors can wager on heads or tails coming up or which team will win the toss. Bettors have to wager $105 to win $100 on any of those possibilities.\n\nSome fans may be interested in how the game's first points will be scored. If the bettor wants to wager that the first points are scored on a touchdown, he must risk $145 to win $100. If the bettor believes the first points will come on a field goal (or a safety), she risks $100 to win $115.\n\nOne of the more popular props is figuring out which player will score the first touchdown of the game. This prop often features a solid return because there are so many players who could make into the end zone first.\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nCam Newton is listed at +700, while Carolina teammates Greg Olsen (+750) and Jonathan Stewart (+800) are fairly close behind. C.J. Anderson, Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders of the Broncos are all +900 to score the first touchdown.\n\nAnother prop includes the number of touchdowns either team will score. If a bettor wants to wager that the Panthers will score three touchdowns or more, it's a proposition that will require a $100 wager and return an equal payoff. However, if the bet is the Panthers will score less than three touchdowns, the bettor must risk $130 to win $100.\n\nThe action number for the Broncos in the number of touchdowns scored is 2.5. Bettors who want the over will risk $100 to win $120, while the under bettors must risk $150 to win $100.\n\nThe game itself features the explosive Carolina offense led by Newton against the Broncos' outstanding defense.\n\nNewton, who has an excellent chance to win the regular-season MVP award, threw 35 TD passes in 2015 -- 11 more than his previous career high. He also ran for 10 touchdowns and has continued his stellar play during the postseason.\n\nThe Broncos had the top-ranked defense in the league from start to finish this season, and that defense keyed their 20-18 victory over the New England Patriots in the AFC title game. Linebacker Von Miller is an outstanding pass-rusher and impact player who had 2.5 sacks and an interception against Tom Brady.\n\nThe Broncos don't have the offensive firepower with Peyton Manning in the lineup at this point in his career. Manning was a record-setting quarterback two years ago with 55 TD passes, but he had just seven scoring passes this season. If the Broncos are going to have a chance to win, they'll need a productive short passing game and a proficient running attack.\n\nThe longer the Broncos can hold on to the ball, the longer they can keep Newton off the field.\n\nThat will not be easy against a Carolina defense that includes pass-rushing defensive tackle Kawann Short (11.0 sacks) and linebacker Luke Kuechly (two interceptions for touchdowns in the postseason).\n\nThe romantic version of the Super Bowl ends with Manning leading the Broncos to the win, lifting the Vince Lombardi Trophy before heading off into retirement.\n\nThe Panthers may have too much firepower to allow that to happen. This final game may not be the anticipated swan song Manning's fans would like to see.\n\nStats courtesy of CBSSports.com. All betting info courtesy of Odds Shark.",

                    "body": "Not only could Super Bowl 50 crown a new champion in the NFL, but it could signal a changing of the guard at quarterback.\n\nFor years, Peyton Manning was the epitome of an NFL QB, and a generation of fans have imitated Manning's constant pre-snap reads during their backyard football games.\n\nManning is nearing the end of his career, though, and as he goes, the Cam Newtons of the world may start claiming supremacy at QB. Between his combination of size, athleticism and throwing ability, Newton is unlike just about any quarterback in NFL history.\n\nNewton isn't in the mold of Robert Griffin III, Vince Young or Michael Vick, who either adapted to the standards of the league, thus toning down their scrambling, or failed altogether once opposing defenses were able to negate their mobility.\n\nMuch like Stephen Curry is redefining the point guard position in the NBA, Newton could be doing the same thing for quarterbacks, and a win for the Carolina Panthers would only embolden those who want to follow in Newton's footsteps.\n\nA win for the Denver Broncos, on the other hand, wouldn't dispel that notion entirely but illustrate the pocket passer won't be dying out anytime soon.\n\nHere's all the viewing information you'll need for Super Bowl 50, along with three more predictions for the game.\n\nWhen: Sunday, Feb. 7 at 6:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, California\n\nWatch: CBS\n\nLive Stream: CBSSports.com\n\nSuper Bowl Predictions Peyton Manning's Flaws Will Be Exposed\n\nJack Dempsey/Associated Press\n\nAfter throwing 17 interceptions in the Broncos' nine games, Manning has been much more careful with the ball since replacing Brock Osweiler in Week 17. That said, Manning can't claim a lot of credit for helping Denver win a conference championship.\n\nThe legendary quarterback ranks 10th in this year's postseason in yards per game (199) and yards per completion (5.77), while his completion percentage (55.1 percent) places him ahead of only Brian Hoyer among starting QBs.\n\nManning didn't prove to be a hindrance against either the Pittsburgh Steelers or New England Patriots, but those teams ranked 15th and 13th, respectively in pass defense DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average), per Football Outsiders.\n\nThe Panthers, on the other hand, are second, only behind the Broncos. They're present one of the toughest tests Manning has faced all season. If he reverts back to his regular-season self, Denver could be toast, per ESPN Stats & Info:\n\nPeyton Manning threw an INT on 5.1% of his pass att. this season, a career high & highest among qualified QBs. Panthers led NFL with 24 INT. -- ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo)\n\nJanuary 29, 2016\n\nDenver's chances don't hinge on Manning alone, but the Broncos might need a better performance from running backs C.J. Anderson or Ronnie Hillman, in addition to another great defensive outing in order to prevail Sunday.\n\nBroncos Won't Be Able to Constantly Harass Cam Newton in the Pocket\n\nThe Broncos' pass rush dominated the Patriots offensive line to such an extent New England fired its O-line coach a day after the AFC title game. Pro Football Focus illustrated how successfully Denver pressured Tom Brady:\n\nTom Brady was under pressure 35.1% of the time this season. On Sunday the Broncos pressured him on 45.9% of his drop backs. -- Pro Football Focus (@PFF)\n\nJanuary 26, 2016\n\n#Broncos D blitzed Brady 10 times on Sunday. Brady went 1-for-9 for 8 yards, and a passer rating of 39.6. -- Pro Football Focus (@PFF)\n\nJanuary 26, 2016\n\nRepeating the task will be difficult with Newton lining up under center in the Super Bowl -- the reasons for which should be fairly evident.\n\nEven in his prime, Brady was never the most fleet of foot. Now, seeing him scramble for 11 yards is enough to send the social media world into a frenzy:\n\nShare Tweet\n\nCam Newton was sacked 33 times during the regular season, 12th-highest in the league, which some Broncos fans might view optimistically working in Denver's favor. FoxSports.com's Matt Chatham explained, however, why the AFC champions can't bring the house quite as much as they did against the Patriots:\n\nAgainst that kind of quarterback, pocket control is infinitely more important than sack totals. The risk of an aggressive up-field attempt at a sack that may garner a marginal loss is outweighed by the probability of Newton stepping up past rushers, escaping the pocket, and delivering a scramble or pass worth exponentially more yardage than the sack. [...]\n\nAnother concern layer to pass rushing against Newton and the Panthers that's dramatically different than rushing against the team that the Broncos got past to get here is Carolina runs the football as their lead option. Pass rush is far from the first reasonable consideration. Because of this, edge rushers have to be aware of getting too far up field and unintentionally creating bigger running lanes.\n\n\"There isn't one like him,\" said Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips of Newton, per USA Today's Lindsay H. Jones. \"You go from Ben Roethlisberger to Tom Brady thinking it won't get any tougher and then you're going against Cam Newton. He's so versatile that he gives you so many problems that a regular drop-back quarterback doesn't. He is a top-notch drop-back quarterback, but he can run with it better than the rest of them.\"\n\nThe quality of Denver's secondary is such that Newton can still struggle even with time in the pocket, and as Chatham argued, running too many blitzes could prove to counterproductive against such an athletic quarterback.\n\nStill, the Broncos had a distinct advantage against the Patriots as a result of their ability to rattle Brady in the pocket. They won't in all likelihood be able to count on a similar edge against the Panthers.\n\nSomebody Will Have a Malcolm Butler Moment\n\nAs much as Newton, Manning, Von Miller, Josh Norman and Greg Olsen, among others, are dominating the spotlight, the Super Bowl is likely to be less about them and more about one player stepping up at the right time.\n\nThe lasting memory from Super Bowl XLIX isn't Brady's 328 yards and four touchdowns, Bobby Wagner's 12 tackles and an interception or Marshawn Lynch's 102 rushing yards and a TD -- though he's a dominant part of the narrative. Malcolm Butler delivered one of the most memorable Super Bowl plays ever when he intercepted Russell Wilson's pass for Ricardo Lockette at the goal line:\n\nShare Tweet\n\nSomething similar may be on the cards for Super Bowl 50 considering so many of the Panthers' and Broncos' strengths overlap. Both defenses can smother the top skill position players on the other side of the ball.\n\nAnderson's success on the ground could swing the game for Denver, or a huge game for Owen Daniels could overshadow the work of Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders. On the other side, Corey Brown or Devin Funchess could make the game-breaking play for Carolina that turns the Super Bowl on its head. Kony Ealy might have a breakthrough filling in for Jared Allen at defensive end.\n\nDespite the supreme talent on display for both teams, don't be surprised if an unheralded star is given the Disneyland treatment following Super Bowl 50.",

                    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- So I was out early one morning last week on the east side of New York to walk Lucy the dog (we are caring for my daughter's 13-year-old Shepherd/Lab mix), and one of the sanitation guys on recycling duty saw me and struck up a conversation about the Super Bowl. \"I want Peyton to win it,\" he said. \"I want to see him ride off into the sunset on top.\"\n\n\"A lot of people want that,\" I said.\n\n\"I don't think he'll do it,\" the guy said. \"But if he doesn't, that's okay. It'll be like the passing of the torch to Cam.\"\n\n\"You just wrote a story for me!\" I told him.\n\nIsn't that the perfect way to sum up the biggest story line of Super Bowl 50? A great endgame for 39-year-old Peyton Manning, the classic pocket quarterback, or a perfect way for Cam Newton, 26, the new all-around quarterback, to take the world stage. In the 50th Super Bowl, a historic storyline goes along with it, in what is likely the last game of Manning's life.\n\nThere's a lot of other stuff at play here too: A second Super Bowl win would be needed legacy fodder for Manning; one world title in 17 years leaves him shy of the greats ... Ron Rivera trying to join his mentor, Mike Ditka, as one of four men to play in a Super Bowl and coach the winning team in one ... Newton trying to join Russell Wilson as the second athlete/quarterback to win the Super Bowl in the last three games -- and also cementing his spot alongside Wilson atop the next generation of great quarterbacks ... John Elway attempting to be the first Super Bowl MVP turned Super Bowl champion architect ... And this one:\n\nThree years ago, if these two quarterbacks met in this game, it might have been advertised as a young David (Newton) versus Goliath (Manning). Now it's the other way around. Newton is Goliath. Manning is David, sort of. Newton is at the top of the NFL game, throwing and running, and Manning is trying to squeeze one more classic performance (and not turn it over) out of a body that's been betraying him most of the season. Until September, in every NFL game he'd played, Manning had been The Man. Now he's The Complementary Man. Life changes.\n\nBut I think I speak for members of both defenses -- Carolina's, which has forced nine turnovers in eight playoff quarters, and the Tom Brady-wrecking Denver D -- when I say they believe they could well be the stars six nights from now. In fact, I'll let Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr., do the talking.\n\n\"Hey,\" Harris said, \"we're Goliaths on this defense.\"\n\nI'm sure Josh Norman, his Panther counterpart, would say the same thing.\n\n* THEY LEFT BRADY BRUISED AND BEATEN: It was business as usual for the defense, which turns its focus to Cam Newton.\n\nPlenty of Super Bowl 50 fodder to come at The MMQB, today and all week. We've got great stuff planned, including from our road trip across America, weaving great Super Bowl tales from Maine to California, some of the best story-telling in the three-season history of our site. (Our crew is in Texas today.)\n\nThe Panthers and Broncos hunkered down an hour south of here after arriving Sunday -- Denver in Santa Clara, 43 miles from San Francisco, and Carolina in San Jose, 51 miles away. The teams will meet the masses tonight for the first Media Night in Super Bowl history, at 8 p.m. ET at the SAP Center, home of the San Jose Sharks, in downtown San Jose. A quick briefing on the logistics here.\n\n* Denver. The Broncos, who landed in San Jose at 4:45 p.m. PT Sunday, are staying just down the street from Levi's Stadium, and practicing 14 miles away at Stanford's practice fields and Stanford Stadium, if desired. They will practice Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at Stanford, and have a walk-through practice on Saturday morning, 11 a.m., at Levi's Stadium, as is their normal custom. They'll meet the media at their hotel Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings, then be cloistered after that until Sunday.\n\n* Carolina. The Panthers landed in San Jose shortly after the Broncos. They are bunking in downtown San Jose and practicing nearby, at the San Jose State University practice fields -- the same site the Ravens used this year when they stayed in the Bay Area on the occasion of back-to-back western games. The team will use the Spartan facilities, including the weight room and trainers' room, for about five hours each day. Same thing as Denver on the media plans, and the post-Thursday cloistering. The Panthers will hold their Saturday walk-through at Levi's Stadium, 1 p.m.\n\n* LUKE KUECHLY IS THE GENTLEMAN LINEBACKER: Four years at a Catholic prep school helped make Luke Kuechly a 'nice boy' off the field, and a ferocious competitor on it.\n\n* NFL crappola. The NFL and most of the press will be HQ'd in downtown San Francisco. NFL Honors, the annual league awards show, will originate from downtown on Saturday, as will the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame voting, also on Saturday. Now onto the normal Monday business of MMQB, starting with one of Stanford's famous alums, going home this week.\n\n* * *\n\nThere haven't been a lot of superstar players who built championship teams. Jerry West with the Lakers, Ozzie Newsome with the Ravens ... who else? Larry Bird couldn't do it. Michael Jordan couldn't. Elway just might be able to. This is the second time in his five seasons running the franchise that Denver's been in a Super Bowl. Since 2012, the Broncos have the best record in football, and 21 of the 22 starters have arrived under Elway's watch, which began in 2011.\n\nAmazing when you think about it. West and Newsome might be it. Elway's trying to join the championship crowd. If he does, it just might then be only West and Elway who won at least one world title as players, made the Hall of Fame, and constructed world championship teams. We really might be seeing something special if Denver wins.\n\nBut what's the thing you almost always hear from players of the past 20 or 30 years, in all sports, when the subject of coaching or scouting or managing or general-managing comes up. No way I'm putting in all that time. Fourteen-hour days? Not happening.\n\nThen there's Elway, son of a coach, for a while. Son of a scout, for a while. Son of a director of pro personnel, for a while. He saw the business, and, in a strange, ironic twist of fate, spent most of the last month of Jack Elway's life with him learning the business. John Elway had no idea that would train him for the life he's living right now.\n\n\"My first introduction to this life,\" Elway said in Denver the other day, \"came in 2001, when I sat in with my Dad, who was the Broncos' pro personnel director, for a month of pre-draft meetings. Mike Shahanan let me sit in on the meetings. I had sold my car dealers to AutoNation, and I was looking to figure out what I might want to do. That month was a great bonding time for me and my dad, hours and hours of meetings, and a great learning experience for me. I remember this lesson from him: Teams are 80 percent players, and 20 percent coaches. He taught me how important athleticism was, and how important competitive drive was. In that draft, I'll never forget -- he loved Drew Brees. He had that competitive fire. And now look at him. That really was a great month for me.\"\n\nRecalled Shanahan: \"Jack Elway was always excellent in those meetings. He really had a sense for players. And so for John, who was always around that life, and very close to his Dad, it was a perfect scenario if you want to grow up to be a GM.\"\n\nThe meetings ended, and Jack Elway went home to Palm Springs, where he planned to retire after that 2001 draft. Then, on April 15, a week before the draft, Jack Elway died of a heart attack at his home. \"I don't know if it was meant to be,\" John Elway said, \"but I am so grateful I got to spend that time with my dad before he passed.\"\n\nElway cut his teeth in Arena Football, running the Colorado Crush (with 25-man rosters) from 2003 to '08. When Elway was asked by owner Pat Bowlen to run the football side of the team in 2011, Elway accepted, and he remembered some of the lessons from his dad. Draft speed. Look for guys who love football. And, of course, get a quarterback. Would Manning have come to Denver had Elway not been running the show? I have my doubts, but we'll never know. His first draft pick was Von Miller. In his first big free-agency season, 2013, Elway signed DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib and T.J. Ward, all impact players on the current strong defense. Some Elwaysisms:\n\n* \"We don't draft all-pros. We develop all-pros.\"\n\n* \"Speed kills. But not 40 speed. Play speed. A guy's 40 speed might be 4.8, but look at his instincts and how he reacts to plays -- that might get his true speed down to 4.6.\"\n\n* \"My priority is getting guys with desire and a real heart for football. Chris Harris Jr., came in here undrafted. [Actually, the college free-agent from Kansas was the final signee before training camp in 2011 for Elway, for a $2,000 bonus.] He comes in, and right away he's first in line in every drill. His character, his football traits, turned out to be so strong.\"\n\n* \"We cherish the bottom of the draft. We cannot afford to miss a draft, because we want to be good for a long time here, and teams that are good for a long time do not miss drafts.\"\n\n\"They just told me to come in here and compete and I'd have a chance,\" said Harris. \"They were right. I was the 11th cornerback out of 11 on the depth chart. That's one of the things I've liked about being here -- it doesn't matter who you are. They bring in a ton of undrafted guys, late-round guys. If you're the best, he [Elway] will keep you.\"\n\n* THE ULTIMATE MISMATCH: In the showdown between the Panthers and the Broncos, it's whether Cam Newton and Carolina can handle Denver's virtually unstoppable pass rush that will determine the game.\n\nThe Broncos, under Elway, have tried to not have hard and fast personnel rules. Denver went wild in free-agency in 2013 but not in any other year. They like to bottom-feed for players, and if you're on the camp roster, you've got a legit chance to make it. Linebacker Brandon Marshall was cut by Jacksonville three times, but he's slid into an important starting role for Denver -- and it was Marshall covering swift New England back James White on many of his 16 targets from Tom Brady (only five of them completed) in the AFC title game last week. Sixth-round linebacker Danny Trevathan has become a vital sideline-to-sideline player.\n\nThere's one other thing Elway has learned. It's something that was reinforced last summer, when he went to Peyton Manning and told him he was going to have to take a $4-million paycut. Yes, the quarterback who was Denver's lifeline back in 2012, who was the key to being in contention every year -- a big paycut. That ended up allowing Denver to sign a starting guard before the season, Evan Mathis, and Manning has since made back $2 million of it, by winning the AFC title game. (The other $2 million will come back to Manning if Denver wins the Super Bowl.) But it was no easy thing. \"I don't get too close to the players,\" Elway said. \"Because I know I might have to make tough decisions, I know I can't be their best friend. I've got to be the bad guy at times. If it's best for the Denver Broncos, I don't worry about personal feelings. I can't.\"\n\nShanahan wanted to illustrate Elway's feelings about winning. So he said he was going to tell a story he has never told before. In 1993, after his first year on the San Francisco coaching staff, Bowlen offered him the Denver head-coaching job. But they were $150,000 per year in salary and a company car apart from Shanahan's bottom line, and Shanahan was holding firm. Elway found out. Elway said he'd pay him the $150,000 a year, and he'd provide the car Shanahan wanted. \"You're coming,\" Elway said. Shanahan felt he couldn't do that. He couldn't have the quarterback paying part of his compensation. So Shanahan stayed in San Francisco. Wade Phillips coached the team for two years, then Bowlen got Shanahan to come, finally, in 1995.\n\n\"John didn't talk to me for a year,\" Shanahan said.\n\nI gave Elway a chance to puff his chest a little about having the best winning percentage in football over the past four years, and being to the Super Bowl twice. He said he was proud, yes, of competing for the title every year. But he built this team to win, and he made it clear the job's not done. Of course, Elway was the quarterback on three Denver Super Bowl teams that lost. Getting to the Big One is good. It's just not good enough. It might be corny. But it's certainly how Elway feels.\n\nSaid Shanahan, \"John knows this more than anybody: Nobody cares who finishes second.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThree stories you'll be sick of by game time Sunday:\n\n* Win one for Peyton.\n\n* Cam Newton revolutionizing the quarterback position.\n\n* The Cam Newton Joy Referendum.\n\nI'll say what I've said several times this year: At a time in NFL history when there is so much to criticize, and when the concussion/head-trauma issue is such a lightning rod that tens of thousands of parents across the country are weighing whether to let their children play football, here comes a man who exudes joy on the field 10, 15, 20 times a game. He smiles, he gestures, he poses, he hands footballs to small children and makes their days. (Years, in many cases.) So I not only don't have a problem with it. I like it. I know there is a divide on this. I get it. Some people feel it's showing up the opposition. In a traditional way, maybe it is. When I coached girls softball, I would not have wanted my girls to celebrate by stopping on the field after a great play and pretending to be Superman. If other teams did it to us, I'd have been ticked off. So I realize there's a disconnect here. I just find it hard to think what Newton does is bush. It's joyous.\n\n* IS CAM THE NEW ELWAY?: A litany of notes out of the championship games and heading into Super Bowl 50, including the Broncos GM on the Panthers QB, Carolina's forgotten architect and why the respect card shouldn't be played again.\n\nNewton is a player who does everything right inside his team. He studies the game and has the kind of relationship with offensive coordinator Mike Shula that Shula freely, every week, adds and subtracts to the gameplan based on what Newton tells him he likes and doesn't like. The trust between them isn't phony. He is so on top of his game that -- and this is the first time I remember seeing this -- he drew Washington defensive lineman offside on consecutive plays in November. How will a defense as aggressive and impactful as Denver's defense play it when, as he did also against Washington, Newton goes under center, takes the snap, fakes a quick sideline throw to Ted Ginn, holds the defense with a play-action fake to Jonathan Stewart, stares briefly at Greg Olsen on a short curl over the middle, then rips a throw to the right sideline to rookie Devin Funchess for a gain of 11? I only mention those examples to show you this isn't a hey-look-at-me guy who doesn't back up his bravado with homework and preparation and practiced skill.\n\nAs Shula told me a few weeks ago: \"Sometimes, I think we need to remind ourselves that football is fun, and when we have fun and we're winning, we're happy. I would never want to change his personality.\"\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame's 46 selectors will gather at 6:30 a.m. Pacific Time on Saturday to elect the 54th class to the Hall. There's one lock among the 15 Modern Era finalists: Brett Favre. The other 14 finalists will vie for four remaining slots (a maximum of five Modern Era people can be elected each year). Each year, there are battles to get through the tiny funnel into Canton. My gut feeling as a voter: After the certainty of Favre, this is the year for linebacker Kevin Greene, who was third on the all-time sack list with 160 when he retired after the 1999 season, and hasn't been passed in the 16 years since. He made first-team all pro with three different teams, and was more impactful in his thirties than his twenties, twice leading the league in sacks -- at age 32 and 34.\n\nAfter that? Lots of mystery. It's going to be very interesting to see how the voters look at the receiver position, where Terrell Owens is eligible for the first time, and Marvin Harrison returns for third try as a finalist. Comparing the average regular season of Harrison's 13 years and Owens' 15:\n\nI see Harrison as one of the precise route-runners of his day, a man extremely hard for defenders to jam, as good a receiver in an out of cuts as there was, superb hands, an excellent partner for the precise Peyton Manning. One minus for him was his championship game and Super Bowl performance (three games: 12 catches, zero touchdowns), but the big plus there was his NFL-record 143-catch season in 2002, and his consistent productivity. Owens, obviously, was irrepressible as a player, a physical force at 225 pounds with nine seasons over 1,000 yards. He never led the league in receptions or receiving yards in a season, but he retired second all-time in yards and third in touchdowns among receivers, and he's not close to being passed in either category. He's going to get into the Hall. The question is: Will it be this year, and will it be at Harrison's expense?\n\nNow, many of you will say, and have said to me, If both are so deserving, why don't you put them both in? Well it's possible that both will make it.\n\nThe way the system works is that after presentations of the candidates and debating, voters cut the list by secret ballot from 15 to 10, and then when the list of 10 is disclosed inside the room, the list is cut by secret ballot again from 10 to five. After that, the five candidates, one by one, are voted on, yea or nay, by secret ballot again. There are other factors, of course, including Owens coming back from injury to play gallantly and productively in the Eagles' Super Bowl loss to New England ... and including Owens' penchant for drops. Harrison had sure hands, and was better and quicker in and out of cuts; Owens was a tremendous physical receiver who could run all day.\n\n* IN CHICAGO, IT'S FOREVER 1985: Three decades after the Bears stamped their mark on history and brought home Chicago's only Lombardi Trophy, the city remains obsessed with the team and its characters.\n\nHarrison was the quietest guy in the locker room, Owens oft-times the loudest and most distracting. But unless either of those things plays a part in how a guy played on the field, or what part that contributed to winning or losing, it's not supposed to be considered by the voters. That stuff plays no factor in my decision.\n\nOften times, when it's close at a position and two men are eligible, I sense the room giving the most voting sentiment to the one who has waited the longest. But that's if it's very, very close, and it may be in this case. We'll see. If I had to guess, I'd say Harrison, at least, makes it. But Owens could make this a two-receiver class.\n\n* * *\n\nThe increase in diagnosed concussions from 206 last season (including training camp practices and preseason games, and regular-season practices and games) to 271 in 2015 is an alarming number, particularly in light of the massive attention -- rightfully so -- to head trauma and more and more deceased players being found with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Just last week, former Giants safety Tyler Sash, who died at 27 in September, was found to have had CTE.\n\nWhat does the increase mean? One of four things, which will likely take a few more years of data study to understand:\n\n1. The game is getting more violent, and as much time as the NFL is devoting to trying to stop the head trauma, it is powerless to do much about it.\n\n2. The 2014 numbers were minimized somehow, perhaps by not as much attentiveness as in 2015 by the independent spotter upstairs or the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants on the sidelines. In other words, some concussions were either overlooked by team physicians or independent watchdogs or hidden by players.\n\n3. The 2015 stats are, collectively, an outlier, a one-year blip on football's radar screen. The numbers had declined from 261 diagnosed concussions in the preseason and regular season in 2012, to 229 in 2013, to 206 in 2014, before spiking up this year.\n\n4. The spike is understandable, given the NFL's concussion-paranoia, which grew this year with the increased attention on the job of the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant, particularly after a concussion of Rams quarterback Case Keenum was missed by the consultant, by the Rams' team medics, and by the athletic trainer seated in the press box who is supposed to be spotting wobbly players.\n\nClearly, there's no way to put these numbers in perspective -- yet. And just as clearly, it is in the NFL's best interests to minimize the impact of Friday's announcement. If 12.1 of the NFL's 1,696 players were concussed in 2014, and that percentage jumped to 16.0 in 2015, there is no way around the fact that the NFL's antennae need to be up. Way up.\n\nOn Saturday, I asked one of the UNCs and co-chair of the NFL's Head, Neck and Spine Committee, Dr. Richard Ellenbogen (he works the visiting sidelines at Seahawks' games) about the data. It is Ellenbogen's job to collect data from the UNC physicians at 64 preseason games, 256 regular-season games and 11 post-season games. He gets two reports per game, one from each sideline.\n\n\"My belief,\" Ellenbogen said on Saturday, \"is that this is not necessarily an increase in concussions suffered during games. We'll see in the coming years if that's true. I think overall we have lowered the threshold for diagnosis. We are much more erring on the side of caution. I was waiting for the culture change to hit, and I sense it is hitting the game right now ... The medical timeout that has been instituted also is a factor, I think. Plus, this year I have sensed more teamwork between the team physician on the sideline and the UNC. Overall, I think this is all good.\"\n\nEllenbogen thinks that as concussion awareness increases, so will self-reporting and the removal of players from games who might not have been removed four or five years ago. In the Pittsburgh-Seattle game this year, Ellenbogen was on the sideline as Ryan Shazier protested being removed from the game after he was wobbly on the field. Ellenbogen and the Steeler physician examined Shazier in the locker room. Though he passed the verbal test, the Steeler doctor chose to hold him out of the game, feeling he wasn't quite right. Later in the game, Ben Roethlisberger self-reported feeling woozy and was removed from the game. So, a few years ago, would Shazier have been kept out of the game -- and would Roethlisberger have self-reported late in a close game?\n\nMy feeling is 16 percent of players in the league suffering a concussion in a season is probably going to be closer to the norm than 12 percent in the future. We'll see, but with so many eyes on the issue, and the sideline medics focused on removing anyone close to concussed, the higher numbers may be the new normal.\n\n* * *\n\n... By the man who engineered it in Super Bowl XXII, Washington quarterback Doug Williams. Seeing that we are on the verge of the 50th Super Bowl, I am giving the floor to Williams to recount what happened 28 years ago, because I believe Washington's five-touchdown second quarter against the Broncos has been given far, far too little attention by history.\n\nThere's not much to argue about here, when considering the greatest quarter in Super Bowl history by an offense. Washington had five drives in the second quarter of the 42-10 rout of Denver. The five drives lasted a total of 18 plays, and produced 357 yards and 35 points. Just think: It's the Super Bowl, the game of your life, and you play the quarter of your life. Every time you touch the ball, 20 yards happens. At least, that was the average Washington gain in this quarter. I asked Williams to relive it, from the week-before and the pressure of trying to be the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl, to how the quarter actually happened.\n\nWilliams, recalling the second quarter and the things around it, from the game on Jan. 31, 1988 in San Diego:\n\n\"Let me tell you this: In my whole life playing football, that was absolutely the best practice week I've had. Coaches had to call us off each other. We were so physical, and so ready. They didn't want anyone to get hurt during the week. We knew we were ready.\n\n\"Late in the first quarter, we were down 10-0, and I hyperextended my knee. They had just put new turf in at the stadium, and I guess there was a section that was damp, because the sun hadn't really hit it, and my right foot slid out from under me. I was laying on the turf and the trainers came out. But I said, 'Don't touch me. If I can walk, I am gonna finish the football game.' I had to come out for a couple of plays and Jay Schroeder went in for me. You know, the previous year, we played the NFC Championship Game against the Giants in New York, and I was the backup. Jay got hit pretty good and he was laying there for a minute, like he was going to have to come out of the game. We didn't have the concussion protocol in those days, and when I got halfway on the field, he just started waving me off. I had to go back to the sideline. That was one of those most embarrassing moments of my life, getting waved off like that.\n\n\"So now, in the Super Bowl, I'm on the sideline, and Jay's getting ready to go back in the game, and [coach] Joe Gibbs comes to me and says -- he always called me 'Douglas' -- 'Douglas, you ready?' I said, 'Yeah coach,' and I went into the game. So now the day came when the guy who waved me off wouldn't get a chance to play.\n\n\"I don't consider there was any pressure on me that day. I always figured I wasn't going to ever put pressure on myself to perform, so I certainly wasn't going to get anyone else put pressure on me from the outside world. But I did understand what was at stake. I wasn't gonna play this game because I was a black quarterback. I was playing this game because I was the quarterback of the Washington Redskins who happened to have earned the job quarterbacking in the Super Bowl.\n\n\"I was very much aware of the atmosphere around the game. I grew up in Louisiana during segregation. The street where I grew up runs from Baton Rouge to Mississippi. There were two intersections, a crossroads. And every Friday night, there was a cross burning at that intersection. That's just the way it was. The Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan lived a few miles from where I lived. Integration didn't happen till my ninth grade year, and even when I got to high school, it was still mostly black because the white kids who should have gone to the school got pulled out and went to private school. I only played with two white guys in high school. But basically, I never worried about it. Then, when I went to Grambling, coach Rob [Eddie Robinson] never preached black and white. He was only about the American flag. I don't know anyone, ever, who could out-American Eddie Robinson. Anyway, with coach Rob, it was all about performance.\n\n\"So we start the quarter at our 20. Their cornerback, Mark Haynes, walks up to press our receiver, Ricky Sanders. One-on-one press coverage. That's a mistake against our receivers, who were so quick. Joe made us believe every time we would win that matchup. It was supposed to be a seven-yard stop route, but in our playbook that automatically converts to a fade downfield if the receiver's jammed at the line. Ricky gets off the jam -- Haynes missed him with his left hand -- and the rest is history. They had no safety help. That was easy.\"\n\nResult: 80-yard touchdown pass, Williams to Sanders. Denver 10, Washington 7.\n\n\"We hold 'em and get the ball back, move it downfield. At their 27, Denver blitzes, and I've got Kelvin Bryant in the flat open. The linebacker's bearing down on me. To this day, every time I see [offensive coordinator] Dan Henning, he always says, 'Why didn't you take the house read there?' And I say, 'I had Gary Clark one-on-one.' I'll take that every time.\"\n\nResult: 27-yard touchdown pass, Williams to Clark. Washington 14, Denver 10.\n\n\"Before the game, Joe had me go tell Timmy Smith he was going to start at running back. I told him, 'Don't f--- this up!' What a game he had. The guys up front, the five linemen, they just dominated all day. On that run, the tight end trapped the nose tackle for Denver, and I handed the ball to Timmy, and when I turned around, there wasn't a Bronco without 10 yards of the line of scrimmage.\"\n\nResult: 58-yard touchdown run by Smith. Washington 21, Denver 10.\n\n* TIMMY SMITH'S ONE BIG GAME, ONE BIG REGRET: The Washington running back was out of the NFL two years later and eventually found himself on the wrong side of the law.\n\n\"So then we tried play-action. The play was 'Play pass counter 60.' So what do you think their safety, [Tony] Lilly, did on that one? He bit. You watch that highlight, with the guards pulling, and it looks just like a run. When he realizes what the play is, Lilly is like, 'Damn! I gotta get back.' Too late.\"\n\nResult: 50-yard touchdown pass, Williams to Sanders. Washington 28, Denver 10.\n\n\"Late in the quarter, we got one more chance, down at the [Denver] eight-yard line. All game, Clint [Didier, the tight end] had been quiet. We sent Ricky Sanders in motion, ran a fake zoom to the other side, and there was Clint, wide open on a corner route. No safety in sight.\n\nResult: 8-yard touchdown pass, Williams to Didier. Washington 35, Denver 10.\n\n\"That was amazing. Just amazing. Thinking back on it ... It's not just five touchdowns in one quarter. We scored 35 points in 18 plays. Think about Peyton Manning drives. What are they -- 12, 13 plays? That's what you want, the clock-killing drive. To score 35 points in 18 plays, you're scoring a touchdown every three minutes. Less than that. In the Super Bowl! You ain't doing that in no bowl! You ain't doing that in Powder Puff!\n\n\"At halftime, we're up 35-10, and Buges [offensive line coach Joe Bugel] comes to me and says, 'Hey Stud,' that's what he always called me, 'Hey Stud, I think we got this. You don't need to come back with that knee.' I told him, 'I started this game, and I'm gonna finish it.' My knee had really stiffened up. But the doctors got out their needle, and we did what we had to do, and we got the job done.\n\n\"We traveled the road less traveled and won the Super Bowl. After the game, there was nothing to say. The game itself was the best statement.\"\n\nNow I had two questions for Williams.\n\nDoes this quarter get enough attention as the best quarter in Super Bowl history?\n\n\"No, but there's not anything I can do about that. It's not my job to blow my own horn. You control what you can control.\"\n\nHave you ever wondered whether it would be more celebrated if John Elway scored 35 points in one quarter?\n\nBaltimore Ravens offensive lineman John Urschel has his first day of school today.\n\nHe'll walk onto the campus of MIT, in Cambridge, Mass., into the first day of the Applied Mathematics Ph.D program at the most august math and technology university in the United States.\n\nSome off-season gig, starting your Ph.D work at MIT.\n\nBut think of what Urschel must feel like this morning, as the football world starts to rev up for the Super Bowl, and 106 football players begin the biggest week of most of their professional lives -- Super Bowl week. Urschel is starting his alternative Super Bowl. It's the dawn of the semester for Ph.D students at MIT, and Urschel is fully intent on becoming as good a mathematician (or better) as he is a football player. I asked him Sunday what he was feeling like on the eve of joining a pretty exclusive club of geniuses at MIT.\n\n\"I feel a lot like I feel before a game,\" he said. \"Nerves are naturally high, feeding off of uncertainty. But overall, I feel commensurate.\"\n\nI feel commensurate. Equivalent, basically. Two months ago, John Urschel, starting one of his seven games this season at center for Baltimore, had to block Ndamukong Suh for much of the game. He had to be commensurate with Suh, or his quarterback was going down. The duel with Suh, he said, and not allowing Suh to sack the quarterback that day, was a thrill for him, the kind of thrill he gets when nearing the end-point of solving a great math problem. Which is why he's in Cambridge today, at MIT.\n\n\"I can't wait to get started,\" Urschel said. \"Naturally, this is a dream come true. I can't think of anything I'd rather be doing than playing in the NFL and getting my Ph.D in math from MIT. I've always aspired to do both, but I never imagined I'd be doing both at the same time.\"\n\nDid you know Urschel has a theorem named after him? Well, co-named. It's called the Urschel-Zikatanov Theorem -- Urschel went to Penn State, and Ludmil Zikatanov was one of his professors and his mathematics mentor -- and it proves, according to the explanation that is far, far, far over the head of an Ohio University journalism grad, that for any connected graph there exists an eigenfunction corresponding to the minimal non-trivial eigenvalue such that the subgraphs induced by the negative and non-negative vertices, respectively, are both connected.\n\nI could tell you what eigenfunction is, but if I did, of course, I'd have to kill you.\n\nThe point is, Urschel is very serious about both of his professions. He will spend time several days a week in a gym in Cambridge this semester, doing the lifts and the cardio and drills he'd be doing for four hours, several days a week. He's intent on continuing both careers. He makes it very clear, thought, that football is his meal ticket, and nothing will take away from his preparation, mental and physical, to start on the Baltimore offensive line this year, and for years to come.\n\n* LUKE KUECHLY IS THE GENTLEMAN LINEBACKER: Four years at a Catholic prep school helped make Luke Kuechly a 'nice boy' off the field, and a ferocious competitor on it.\n\nThe question that seems most elephant-in-the-room about Urschel is the one about his future in football, and his long-term future in math. With the news about concussions and head trauma (Urschel has suffered one concussion in the NFL -- last August in training camp), and the fear of repetitive blows to the head rendering the brain weaker to do the kinds of things mathematicians would obviously have to be clear-headed enough to do, doesn't playing football take on an added layer of, well, terror?\n\nAnd Urschel said something about the prime age of great talents in both fields that really surprised me.\n\n\"It's something I have thought about, and of course it's a concern,\" he said, about blows to the head, and what they could mean to his mathematics future.\n\nBut ...\n\n\"Both math and football are young persons' games. Very few guys are still playing at 40. The major prize in math is the Fields Medal, which is given to a mathematician 40 or younger. That's our Nobel Prize. I try to do what I enjoy, and I really enjoy playing football and doing mathematics. I recovered from the concussion I had, and I didn't seem to have any after-effects.\n\n\"Time is constantly running out on you. I don't know when I'll die. I don't know when I'll be fired by the Ravens. I don't know when I won't be sharp enough to produce elegant and meaningful mathematical results. But my plan is to work as hard as I can on both things and try to be as accomplished as I can in both things. They both bring me great fulfillment.\"\n\nOne more thing about Urschel I found interesting. (Actually, there are 48 more things, but this was the most compelling to me.) He is determined to not be, as he says, \"that football player who does math.\" He wants to be the best in his business. Both businesses. He has a ways to go to be a Marshal Yanda in football; Pro Football Focus had Urschel rated the 28th of 40 centers in the league in 2015. But clearly he's known for being a football player, and he doesn't want that to be his claim to fame in the math world.\n\n\"It's important to me that my work as a mathematician stands on its own footing,\" Urschel said. \"I don't want to be viewed as some sideshow. I want it to be known that I do good mathematical research, and that this is independent of what I do on Sundays. I want to be remembered as a good mathematician. Really, I want to be elite. MIT is the first step.\"\n\nIt is very, very hard not to root for Urschel. In both worlds.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen the Denver running back was 10 and growing up east of San Francisco, Anderson watched on TV as Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl with the Patriots to cap the 2001 season. \"Mom,\" he said to his mother that day, \"Tom Brady's from the Bay Area, just like me.\" That's the day, Anderson said, when his NFL dream was born.\n\nAnd so Anderson sought out Brady after the AFC title game eight days ago. He was stunned that Brady was so praiseworthy of Anderson first. Brady told Anderson he loved the way he plays, he knew Anderson came up from being an undrafted free agent, and, as Anderson recalled Brady saying, \"Keep proving people wrong.\"\n\nAnderson posted a photo of their meeting on Instagram last Monday, and thanked Brady profusely for his words (\"They will stick ... I have MAD RESPECT\" wrote Anderson). He's particularly drawn to Brady, he said, because Brady was a sixth-round pick in 2000 and faced heavy odds to become a starting quarterback, never mind one of the great quarterbacks of all time. Anderson was still blown away days later when he thought of Brady's kindness in the moments after such a tough loss.\n\n\"I know a lot of people hate Tom,\" Anderson said on Friday, \"but I will never forget those words he spoke to me. He just came toward me and yelled, 'C.J!' and said what he said. That was a beautiful moment. Heartwarming. Those words were just as special as when I got to the Broncos and Peyton Manning walked up to me and said, 'C.J., welcome. Glad you're here.' I remember when I was 11 or 12 years old thinking, If I could have the chance to play with two quarterbacks in my life, it'd be Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. And now we're going to the Super Bowl for the second time in three years.\"\n\nSaid Anderson: \"Man, I am living the dream.\"\n\nIf you've visited our site in the past week, you've surely noticed The MMQB's Road to Super Bowl 50 is in full swing. Here's where we've gone so far...\n\nKENNEBUNKPORT, Maine -- A visit with a fan who's about to attend his 50th Super Bowl.\n\nMIDDLETOWN, N.J. -- Vince Lombardi's understated gravesite has become a shrine to football fans across the nation.\n\nPONTIAC, Mich. -- The birth of the 49ers dynasty and the death of a dome.\n\nPITTSBURGH -- Franco Harris, the Steelers' first Super Bowl MVP, is now in the donut business.\n\nAURORA, Colo. -- How Timmy Smith, the only man to rush for 200 yards in a Super Bowl, found himself on the wrong side of the law.\n\nYOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -- Long-time Ohio State coach Jim Tressel talks about his five former players who will take the field in Super Bowl 50.\n\nCINCINNATI -- Ickey Woods gives a dance tutorial and in a wide-ranging Q&A shares his thoughts on the negativity surrounding Cam Newton's celebrations and his charity work after the tragic loss of his son.\n\nCINCINNATI -- Four years at St. Xavier helped make Luke Kuechly a 'nice boy' off the field, and a ferocious competitor on it.

There isn't one like him. I haven't seen one like him. None of us have.\"\n\n-- Denver defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, on his Super Bowl foe.\n\nIII\n\n\"I like Cam Newton. If he played defense, he probably would've gotten $220 million because he can probably rush the passer and drop back and play safety.\"\n\n-- Denver pass-rusher Von Miller, who knows a good defensive prospect when he sees it.\n\nIV\n\n\"Today I decided our team will stay in San Diego for the 2016 season and I hope for the long term in a new stadium ... We have an option and an agreement with the Los Angeles Rams to go to Inglewood in the next year, but my focus is on San Diego. This has been our home for 55 years, and I want to keep the team here and provide the world-class stadium experience you deserve ... I am committed to looking at this with a fresh perspective and a new sense of possibility.\"\n\n-- San Diego Chargers chairman Dean Spanos, in a statement Friday. The team now has the best of both (temporary) worlds: It can play in San Diego while negotiating with the city for a permanent stadium, and if things don't work, the Chargers have until mid-January 2017 to opt into the Rams' stadium in Los Angeles as the second team there.\n\nV\n\n\"Fortunately for us all, you decided the alternative as not acceptable. We would have despised you ... Hell hath no fury like fans scorned.\"\n\n-- Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune, on what the locals would have thought of Spanos had he taken the Los Angeles deal with the Rams' Stan Kroenke.\n\nVI\n\n\"I do welcome it. It's been garbage from the first day it came out. It's still garbage today.\"\n\n-- Peyton Manning, asked about the NFL's investigation in the Al Jazeera claims that HGH was shipped to his wife Ashley, and the inference that it was intended for him, not her.\n\n* AL JAZEERA, HGH AND THE NFL: A look at where the league's investigation is now.\n\nI have a theory about Peyton Manning. It's that in the 48 days he sat out with a bad foot and other maladies he looked around at his team and thought: I need to be complementary player, not the leader of the band. If I don't turn it over, we've got a pretty good chance to win. Maybe that happened subconsciously, maybe not. The point is, Manning has come back with the attitude of a player focused on taking care of the ball.\n\nRegular-season Peyton Manning versus post-season Manning:\n\nII\n\nWe have considered all season that the Carolina receivers, as a whole, are a pretty meh group. But can anyone say they've dragged the team down in any way? Nope. Comparing Cam Newton's top four targets (Ted Ginn, Jerricho Cotchery, Corey Brown, Greg Olsen) to the more vaunted Denver group (Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders, Jordan Norwood, Owen Daniels) entering the Super Bowl, including regular-season and playoff games:\n\nWhat's most interesting, I think, looking at the comparative numbers, is the yards per catch on each side. Cam Newton, obviously, is more dangerous downfield than Peyton Manning ... even at tight end. Greg Olsen's yards-per-catch in 18 games: 14.5 yards. The combined yards-per-catch of Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders: 13.4.\n\nIII\n\nA Sort of Homecoming Dept.: How weird will it be for Vernon Davis to return to his home field Sunday? The man has become a non-factor, mostly, since being traded from San Francisco to Denver on Nov. 2 ... and it's clear that Niners GM Trent Baalke won this trade over John Elway. Baalke got sixth-round picks in 2016 and 2017 from Denver for Davis and a single seventh-round pick.\n\nIn the last four games -- against Cincinnati, San Diego, Pittsburgh and New England -- here is the disappearing Davis's numbers as Denver's distant third tight end: 22 plays, 1 target, 0 receptions.\n\nIV\n\nIn 28 drives this post-season against two quarterbacks with a total of six Super Bowl titles between them -- Ben Roethlisberger and Tom Brady -- the Denver defense has allowed one touchdown pass.\n\nTen years ago this week -- on Feb. 4, 2006 -- Warren Moon was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThat is the last time a quarterback was elected to the Hall.\n\nSixty men have been enshrined in the nine years since then.\n\nOn Saturday, 10 years and two days after Moon got the call, Brett Favre will get a similar one.\n\nII\n\nMike Leach retired the other day. It probably didn't register much on your radar. Leach began his football life as a wide receiver at Boston University, was moved to tight end, then had to transfer to William & Mary when BU dropped football after the 1997 season. He played tight end and punter for two years at William & Mary, then got signed as training-camp fodder as a tight end for Tennessee in 2000 and only became a long-snapper when special teams coach Alan Lowry saw him doing it for fun one day. That led to him snapping for the Titans, and later for Denver and Arizona. He retired at 39.\n\nLeach's career is notable -- to me at least -- because he finished his career with 1,518 consecutive snaps without error.\n\nThat's 840 punts snaps, 376 field-goal snaps and 302 PAT snaps without bouncing one, or snapping it over the head of the holder.\n\nHis last error: Christmas Eve 2005 against the Raiders, in a 22-3 win, when he snapped the ball to holder Jake Plummer on a PAT try before Plummer was ready, and the ball spiraled back and nailed Plummer right in the throat.\n\nSince that moment, Leach did his job well for 168-and-a-half games.\n\nI'm rather impressed with that.\n\nI asked Leach other day what he was most proud of in his career. \"Surviving as long as I did,\" he said. \"And I'm proud to say I never cost my team a game. I never had what you'd call a catastrophic snap. When I broke in with Tennessee in 2000, I don't remember which coach it was, but one of them said to me, 'They just brought you in here for three weeks to beat you up and send you home.' And I lasted 16 years.\"\n\nAbout the streak of 1,518 straight snaps without error, Leach credited his mindset, and consistency. \"You can never let the moment get big,\" he said. \"Let your muscle memory take over. Make every snap in practice, a game, the off-season or during the season, exactly the same.\"\n\n* * *\n\nLeaving Amarena, a swell Italian restaurant in San Francisco Sunday night, the man/the myth/the legend, Gil Brandt, got into the car picking him up and cheerily said, \"Hello, Mr. Uber!\"\n\nThe subject turned to Kezar Stadium, the windy San Francisco ballpark where the 49ers played through the 1970 season. The seagull-filled place that John Brodie called home may have been better known as the stadium site for Dirty Harry filming in 1971, just months after the Niners moved down the road to Candlestick Park.\n\n\"The locker room,\" said Brandt, \"was about as big as this car.\"\n\nThe other dinner guest, longtime NFL fixture Mike Ornstein, asked Brandt, \"Hey Gil: Even done a book?\"\n\nI go away on the road to earn a living for my family. Then, I come home to discover the betrayal.\n\nGirl Scout cookies have come and gone. -- Sam Farmer (@LATimesfarmer)\n\nJanuary 30, 2016\n\n* * *\n\n1. I think, as I wrote two weeks ago, Calvin Johnson is going to retire. And Adam Schefter's report, that the 31-year-old receiver told the Lions that he has played his last game, solidifies that belief.\n\n* BIRTH OF A DYNASTY, DEATH OF A DOME: Thirty-four years ago, the Silverdome hosted Super Bowl XVI and the 49ers began their decade of dominance. With the Detroit stadium now in ruins, let's look back at how San Francisco began its run.\n\n2. I think this is now the Cleveland Browns football decision-making tree. See if you can spot a trend:\n\n* Hue Jackson, head coach, 50 years old. Degree in physical education, University of the Pacific. Quarterback, Pacific.\n\n* Sashi Brown, Executive VP of football operations, 39. Degree in communications, Hampton University. Law degree, Harvard.\n\n* Andrew Berry, VP of player personnel, 28. Degree in economics, Harvard. Cornerback, Harvard. Masters in computer science, Harvard.\n\n* Paul DePodesta, chief strategy officer, 43. Degree in economics, Harvard. Wide receiver, Harvard.\n\n* Alec Scheiner, president, 45. Degrees in economics and Latin American studies, Georgetown. Law degree, Georgetown.\n\nSo ... with the exception of the head coach (and I can tell you, Jackson has been well trained in the school of hard knocks), the Browns will be run by four brainiacs between 28 and 43, three with advanced degrees from Harvard or Georgetown. The fourth, DePodesta, was one of the brains behind Moneyball. This is going to be a very, very interesting year in Cleveland.\n\n* CAN A MONEYBALL MAVEN FIX THE BROWNS?: An MLB expert weighs in on what the hiring of Paul DePodesta means for the Browns and the NFL.\n\n3. I think Wade Phillips spoke on Friday on what every coach on every level of sports should hear. All sports, not just football. Phillips thinks coaches should tailor what they do to the talent they have, not the other way around. \"I don't understand the people that say, 'Hey, this is our scheme and that guy can't play in it,'\" Phillips said Friday. \"Well, to me, there's something wrong with your scheme. You adapt the scheme to what the players can do, not what you can think of. We've always done it that way. We started with [Hall of Fame defensive end] Elvin Bethea. We played a lot of the same things that we play now, but he was so quick and so fast that we stunted him all the time. He was our second-leading tackler on the team as a defensive end. He was a great player, but we didn't let him sit there all the time playing our technique that you have to play, two-gap or whatever. The nose guards that I've had -- I've had four or five of them make the Pro Bowl. All of them are different. Ted Washington was huge. We played more in the middle with him, but he controlled the gap. Jamal Williams, he was a powerful guy, so we offset him on the nose and played the same gap, but he hard-charged. We had Greg Kragen here. He was an undersized nose guard and we stunted him to that same gap. It's the same defense, but it's different players. That's what you have to do. We played Quentin Jammer at corner. His name was perfect because he wasn't great playing off, but he was great at jamming a guy on the line of scrimmage. In zone, man and everything that we did, he jammed the guy on line of scrimmage and played well. That's what you do. That's a simple way of telling you how you play with players you have and fit your scheme to what they can do.\"\n\n* 11 ASSISTANT COACHES WHOSE NAMES YOU SHOULD KNOW: Each played a vital role for his team in 2015.\n\n4. I think this is what you need to know about the state of the Pro Bowl today: One of the six quarterbacks named to the Pro Bowl in December played in the game (Russell Wilson). Cam Newton couldn't. Of the other four, one (Aaron Rodgers, minor knee surgery) had an injury excuse. The other three -- Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, Carson Palmer -- could have played but chose not to. Drew Brees and Philip Rivers chose not to play. One of the league's top 10 quarterbacks in passing yards, one (Eli Manning, sixth) suited up Sunday. Where the other five quarterbacks ranked on the yardage list in 2015: Jameis Winston 11, Russell Wilson 12, Derek Carr 13, Teddy Bridgewater 22, Tyrod Taylor 23.\n\n5. I think I'm through railing against the Pro Bowl. If people want to watch the \"game,\" who am I to stop them? Players like it; it's a free trip to Hawaii, with prize money whether they \"win\" or \"lose.\" But I have zero interest in it. It's a bunch of guys -- rightfully -- trying not to get hurt in a contest that isn't really a contest.\n\n6. I think the problem with turning the Pro Bowl into some sort of skills competition, as some have suggested, is this: If you ran the New York Giants, and you knew Odell Beckham Jr. hadn't been working out regularly in the four weeks since the end of the season, and Beckham had a history of hamstring injuries (he has had hamstring issues in 2014 and '15), and Beckham was on tap to run a 40-yard dash against four other speedy guys, and then was going to enter the long-jump against four or five guys ... I mean, how would a team and the player feel about this? I'll tell you what will kill the Pro Bowl or some athletic contest taking the place of the Pro Bowl: the first star who blows out a knee in some silly athletic contest because people won't let the Pro Bowl die a sensible death.\n\n7. I think one of the silliest things I see in the media is the attempt to draw conclusions about how many penalties a crew will call in a playoff game based on who the referee is. Bizarre. Crews are not the same in the playoffs. The stats of what a ref's crew might call in a playoff game is totally irrelevant to how many calls were attributed to that ref's crew during the regular season. Further, to ascribe any meaning of the numbers of pass-interference or illegal-contact calls as a trend for a referee during the playoffs is particularly absurd. Referees are watching the quarterback and the play around the pocket once the ball is snapped; their job is never watching hand-fighting among corners and receivers.\n\n8. I think this was the Pro Football Talk story in the last week that surprised me the least: \"Police deal with another incident between Manziel, girlfriend.\"\n\n9. I think if I were the Cowboys, and I had my choice between Robert Griffin III and Johnny Manziel, I'd pick Griffin. Fifty times out of 50.\n\n10. I think these are my non-Super Bowl thoughts of the week:\n\na. Best thing I heard or read in the past week: The BBC story about the explosion of the Challenger, killing all seven aboard -- from the perspective of Barbara Morgan, the backup to the teacher aboard the shuttle who died, Christa McAuliffe. Morgan was so taken with the experience, so smitten with space flight, that she quit her job as a teacher and became an astronaut. Morgan actually took flight 21 years after the Challenger exploded. What a story.\n\nb. I'm not particularly fond of ornithology, but wow, is this a cool map and story in the New York Times about bird life patterns.\n\nc. I do believe that is my first reference to birds in 19 seasons writing this column. Other than Ravens and Eagles and Seahawks.\n\nd. John Scott, you're an all-star in my book. I didn't even watch the game, and now I wish I had.\n\ne. Coffeenerdness: Don Banks bought me coffee Sunday afternoon in San Francisco. A tall latte macchiato, one of the new drinks at Starbucks, to be exact. Quite pleased with it. Intense.\n\nf. Beernerdness: Happiness in San Francisco, out to dinner on the first night here, is finding Pliny The Elder on tap. Smell that beer. Smells like a pinecone! Tastes superb.\n\ng. And so for the many of you who have asked, this is what I know about GLEASON, the documentary sold to Amazon and Open Road Films for in the neighborhood of $2.5 million last week: The film will be shown in theaters in North America in mid- to late-summer this year, to get a good distribution and also to make it eligible for the awards season in the documentary category. Then, Amazon will distribute the film widely. So for those who want to see it, and who missed it at the Sundance Film Festival, you'll be able to catch it in July or August on the big screen, and later on the small screen.\n\nh. I found myself watching a lot of Iowa and New Hampshire politics in the last week and thinking, Wouldn't it be fun to cover a presidential campaign?",

                    "body": "With Super Bowl 50 just six days away, betting odds on the big game have gone back and forth since the original opening line.\n\nThe one-loss Carolina Panthers certainly have the edge in talent, but the Denver Broncos bring experience and the NFL's top defense. Per Odds Shark, talent trumped experience just minutes after the matchup was set, as the Panthers opened as 3.5-point favorites, with both teams at minus-110.\n\nAs of Sunday night, the spread jumped to six in favor of the Panthers, as bettors felt good about Carolina covering the opening line. Denver crept up to minus-105, while Carolina fell to minus-115.\n\nWith the game finally here, it's always interesting to look back and see how the two Super Bowl teams were projected to fare before the season began. According to RJ Bell of Pregame.com, odds were different for the two teams in September:\n\nPreseason Super Bowl Champ odds:#Broncos 10/1 (only 5 teams with better odds)#Panthers 60/1 (only 9 teams with worse odds) -- RJ Bell (@RJinVegas)\n\nJanuary 25, 2016\n\nThose hoping to ride the Panthers to a big payday based on an outright victory will need to dig deep into their pockets. After opening at minus-177, the money line on Carolina moved to minus-210 as of Sunday. An outright win for the Broncos would pay off for those trusting in Peyton Manning, with a money line of plus-175.\n\nIt's clear oddsmakers are confident the Panthers will win the game, but let's take a look at how the teams match up on the field, per Bleacher Report:\n\nIf the saying \"defense wins championships\" always rang true, the Broncos would win this one going away. However, those trying to make money off the game need to realize that while Carolina's offense is one of the best in the game, its defense is better than many people think.\n\nThe Panthers' 39 takeaways were tops in the NFL, and the offense doesn't give it away often, which led to Carolina finishing first in turnover margin at plus-20. The Broncos may have allowed a stingy 18.5 points per game, but the Panthers were right on their heels at 19.3.\n\nAnother reason the safe bet is the Panthers is their success against the spread in 2015. While Denver was a decent 8-6-2, Carolina stood at 11-5, with only the Cincinnati Bengals and Minnesota Vikings holding better ATS records, per Vegas Insider.\n\nAt this point, it's nearly impossible to find something likely MVP quarterback Cam Newton and the Panthers don't do well, which makes sense considering they were eight points away from a perfect season. Finishing 18-1 would be better than when the New England Patriots did so after a Super Bowl 42 loss.\n\nEven college basketball analyst Dick Vitale is weighing in on how good Carolina has been this year:\n\nPanthers will win Super Bowl Baby Cam is too good ! 10 surprising facts about Super Bowl matchup https://t.co/x62c5gNjlg via @USATODAY -- Dick Vitale (@DickieV)\n\nFebruary 1, 2016\n\nWith Manning nearing 40 and relying on his brain and defense more than his arm, it's hard to believe his team will find a way to defeat a juggernaut Carolina squad with few weaknesses. It may seem like taking the Broncos on any bet is a bad idea, but that's not exactly the case.\n\nThere are plenty of prop bets for the game, and one in particular regarding the Broncos is safer than any on-field action. Bovada lists the odds at plus-120 that announcers will mention the fact that Denver head coach Gary Kubiak was John Elway's backup. Considering there are roughly 11 minutes of football action during the three-hour broadcast, the TV personalities have to fill the air somehow. And it certainly wouldn't be the first time they've mentioned that interesting factoid.\n\nManning, who is 1-2 in Super Bowls, provided great insight about playing for a championship, per Jeff Legwold of ESPN.com: \"I'm very grateful for the opportunity to be going back to a Super Bowl, and I can certainly attest that winning is a lot better than losing.\"\n\nWiser words have never been spoken. Winners will take the Panthers on Super Bowl Sunday -- unless they want to spend three hours hoping Kubiak and Elway are mentioned in the same sentence.",

                    "title": "NFL Super Bowl Week Hangover: Cam Newton vs. Peyton Manning vs. America - Bleacher Report",
                    "body": "Welcome to the most important political primary of the year! It's Super Bowl 50 Week, a nationwide referendum on race, privilege, perception, the modern pharmaceutical culture and lots of other critical topics, followed by a football game that the Panthers will probably win.\n\nCam Newton got the sizzling off-field chatter rolling on Wednesday when asked why he receives so much criticism about his touchdown celebrations and the like. \"I'm an African-American quarterback,\" he told reporters. \"That may scare a lot of people because they haven't seen nothing that they can compare me to.\"\n\nSome nodded at Newton's remark as being blindingly obvious. Others responded with predictable thou doth protest too much faux shock that race might somehow still play a role in our perceptions of anything in this multicultural utopia we have built. There's the How dare he play the race card angle, of course. There's also the Obama's politically correct nanny state interpretation. In the slightly less hawkish middle of the spectrum lie measured condemnations of \"showboating\" (a term derived from 19th-century Mississippi riverboat shows usually performed by...oh, you get it) or exhortations, both in the articles already linked and in some radio interviews I have done, along the lines of: Has Cam Newton ever heard of a fellow named RUSSELL WILSON?\n\nOr something like that. I have drank beer in enough West Virginia taprooms on road trips, monitored enough middle school cafeterias and sweated in enough suburban saunas (filled with nothing but other gray-bearded white guys) to chuckle resignedly to myself when I hear \"no-no-no, this has nothing to do with race\" about any particular topic. I have heard enough not-so-carefully coded language in media rooms and NFL circles to know the problem hasn't been relegated to Confederate flag rallies or Archie Bunker's living room.\n\nSome folks still have trouble thinking clearly about black quarterbacks, folks. It did not come up so much in connection with Russell Wilson because: a) Wilson has an extremely conservative demeanor; and b) we had Richard Sherman and Marshawn Lynch to obsess over in the last two Super Bowls.\n\nThe battle over Newton's remarks, like all the best American political battles, is being waged through: a) Internet memes; b) pull quotes from everyone tangentially related to the issue, from Doug Williams to Steve Smith; and c) think pieces. Lots of think pieces.\n\nFor the next week, a complex, multi-layered social issue will be oversimplified into a conversation between hundreds of sportswriters with no expertise in this topic and tight deadlines and one 26-year-old football player with a Yogi Berra-like command of the language. Somehow, it will still be a more informed conversation than most of what is emanating from the presidential primaries these days. Heck, at least we are talking about race, not talking around it.\n\nDavid Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nPeyton Manning, our other Super Bowl quarterback, stands accused by a media investigation of obtaining a banned-by-the-NFL, legal-when-prescribed substance five years ago, when Manning was recovering from an injury. If somehow found guilty (like, Ted Wells finds a cellphone in Manning's trash can with an \"HGH rules, Brady drools\" sticker on it), Manning faces a six-game suspension according to the NFL collective bargaining agreement. But the Manning HGH story wouldn't be a story if it was about policy and procedure. It's about DRUGS, and CHEATING and PRESERVING THE SANCTITY OF SPORTS, a phrase so silly it should be read in a Monty Python voice, and of course the DOWNFALL OF AN AMERICAN ICON, something we weirdly root for.\n\nThe NFL is investigating the allegations, because if there is one thing we all trust, it's an NFL investigation. Human growth hormone is difficult to detect in the best of circumstances, and the NFL investigators couldn't spot a Bond villain if they saw a dude with a monocle stroking a kitty-cat in a volcano lair. There is zero chance that the Manning allegations will result in anything definite, which makes it both the perfect NFL scandal and the perfect political scandal. Everyone can take sides based on his preconceived notions and walk away satisfied.\n\nJust as we still obsess about black quarterbacks' athleticism, maturity and leadership decades after Doug Williams and James Harris, we still hear the phrase \"performance enhancing drugs\" and think of Drago from Rocky IV. America isn't very good at nuanced debates.\n\nManning's involvement, of course, brings layers of preconceived notions, potential double standards, regional rivalries and the inescapable fact that this story was about to disappear quietly before the Broncos reached the Super Bowl. We don't focus on the most important topics, just the ones that happen to move into the spotlight.\n\n(The Manning story admittedly appears pretty small right now, when stacked up against the all-trumping racial issue and last year's Deflategate mass hysteria. But all it takes is one suspicious-sounding text message exchange to put us in the path of a tidal wave, folks. And this will be a long week).\n\nIf we polled a thousand people on their feelings about Cam Newton's racial opinions and Peyton Manning's HGH allegations on some kind of 0-to-10 scale, then graphed the results on an xy-axis, we would probably find lots of demographic clusters and trends. The graph could be used as a litmus test to determine a respondent's age, race, education level, socioeconomic class, political party, geographic region, whether they think Seth McFarlane is a comic genius, whether they are actually Seth McFarlane, where they shop, and various other insights.\n\nAs a society, we are so polarized and predictable that we wear our values on our sleeves when talking about NFL quarterbacks. And nothing you post in the comment thread or shout at me on Twitter will change my mind, just as nothing I write can change yours, though I appreciate your readership.\n\nWe can't talk politics (or race or class or gender equity or even Star Wars spoilers) in polite company anymore, even though we really need to (well, all but the spoilers). We can, however, have a proxy argument during Super Bowl week about whether dabbing is bad sportsmanship, if the drug policies of major sports are regressive, where \"gotcha\" journalism ends and how much benefit-of-the-doubt is too much and for whom, and so on.\n\nThen we can all sit down together and watch a football game, cheer and gasp and laugh, then return to our neutral corners, determine what the game's outcome means for society at large and individual players' legacies, and prepare for a nine-month election season that's bound to leave us all more outraged and exasperated than enlightened.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 gives us all a chance to speak our minds, then to vicariously hash out our differences on the field. Let's enjoy this chance to tackle Big Topics in simple ways while we still have it.\n\nSuper Bowl Week in Preview\n\nHere is a brief rundown of some of the other big stories entering Super Bowl week. The first guy on this list is the only person with any chance of breaking through the Cam-Peyton ceiling, though he may have to use a bionic arm to do so.\n\nThe Big Injury\n\nPanthers linebacker Thomas Davis hopes to play despite 12 screws and a plate in the right arm he broke last week. Davis will also have to endure the throbbing migraine he will have by the end of the week after answering 20,000 questions about the status of his broken arm.\n\nScott Cunningham/Getty Images\n\nThe Davis situation reminds me of Maurkice Pouncey in Super Bowl XLV. Pouncey, then a rookie, suffered a high ankle sprain during the AFC Championship Game. The week before Super Bowl week was full of optimistic/hopeful reports about the Steelers center walking without crutches, hoping to participate in practice, and so forth. But Pouncey was ruled out five days before that Super Bowl, because you cannot play center on a badly sprained ankle.\n\nI wish Thomas Davis all the best, but you cannot play linebacker with a broken arm, either.\n\nWill Broncos Safeties Play?\n\nBoth Darian Stewart (knee) and T.J. Ward (ankle) will be subjected to injury scrutiny usually reserved for quarterbacks, Adrian Peterson and Rob Gronkowski.\n\nStewart and Ward are vital players for the Broncos defense, of course.\n\nJust to deliver a taste of the kind of deep-dive analysis you will drown in for six days: The Broncos rank 8th in the NFL in defending opponents' tight ends, according to Football Outsiders. They rank in the top five against just about every other type of receiver. The Panthers use tight end Greg Olsen as their primary possession receiver, and Ward and Stewart would typically divvy up coverage responsibilities against him. If Stewart and/or Ward are limited, it's one more matchup working against the Broncos in a game where many of the matchups appear to work against the Broncos.\n\nRyan Clady Willing to Rework Contract\n\nUm, can it wait until next week, Ryan? Everyone's a little busy.\n\nClady is due nearly $20 million over the next two years and missed all of this season with an ACL tear, so it makes sense for him and his agent, as reported by the Associated Press, to get ahead of contract-restructuring talks before cap-casualty season begins.\n\nGetting the story into the Super Bowl stack also reminds us that the Broncos had this remarkable season without their Pro Bowl left tackle, which can interpreted either as \"imagine how good they could be with him\" or \"gee, they seemed to do pretty well without him.\"\n\nWhen it comes to long-range financial planning, Clady isn't the Broncos veteran who raises the most questions, of course. But the other guy still has one football game to play.\n\nCan Denver Run for 105 yards?\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images C.J. Anderson\n\nThe Broncos are 9-0 this season when they run for 105 yards or more. This stat actually flashed on NFL Network's crawl throughout the weekend. It's the kind of nutty nugget that makes Super Bowl coverage seem trite (when only most of it is) while keeping football analytics firmly rooted in the Stone Age. It's a double-whammy of statistical tomfoolery.\n\nFirst, it rehashes the old cause-and-effect problem of running the ball and winning games. Teams tend to accumulate higher rushing totals because they are playing with a lead; they don't take the lead (in most NFL circumstances) because they are accumulating high rushing totals.\n\nThe Broncos also have a gaudy record when they kick off more than their opponent and their quarterback kneels more often than the opponent's quarterback, but no one says that a team should \"establish the kickoffs and kneels.\"\n\nSecond, that \"105 yards\" plateau is flashing like a neon sign, isn't it? You look at it and just know that the Broncos lost a game in which they rushed for between 100 and 104 yards.\n\nSure enough, they rushed for 104 yards in their regular-season loss to the Steelers. For some reason, an NFL Network staffer didn't think a 9-1 record when rushing for over 100 yards was impressive enough.\n\nThe Broncos do play better when their running game is humming, and running the ball is more important to them than it is to a team like the Patriots. Just don't expect the Panthers to fall to their knees in surrender if the Broncos reach 106 rushing yards.\n\nThe Donald's Choice\n\nDonald Trump is rooting for the Broncos because he knows Peyton Manning. There are all sorts of ways to go here. I just can't stop picturing the Trump, Peyton and Trump-buddy Tom Brady bowling together like the guys from The Big Lebowski.\n\nAround the League\n\nAdam Schefter of ESPN reports that Calvin Johnson plans to retire. Johnson is 30 years old. Barry Sanders retired at 30. Playing for the Lions must be like Logan's Run.\n\nLas Vegas building domed stadium, hopes to attract the Raiders. \"I'm shocked, SHOCKED, to find that gambling is going on in here!\"\n\n\"Here are your daily fantasy winnings.\"\n\n\"Oh thank you very much.\"\n\nShare Tweet\n\nPayment processing company cuts ties with FanDuel and Draft Kings. It could be a major blow to the daily fantasy services, which need reliable ways of moving huge sums of money around quickly. If anyone needs to leave the country in a hurry, the letters of transit are in Sam's piano.\n\nChiefs sign Travis Kelce to a lucrative extension. The no-brainer talks probably took about five minutes. Just like your typical Chiefs two-minute drill.\n\nChargers to play in San Diego in 2016, may move in 2017. Someone please go unchain Philip Rivers from that bulldozer.\n\n49ers owner Jed York tells Rich Eisen he would never hire a coach away from Notre Dame, his alma mater. You can hear Chip Kelly in York's office next year. \"Technically, boss, you and Trent Baalke each took that Marketing 101 course from University of Phoenix, so...\"\n\nFalcons GM Thomas Dimitroff confesses to past personnel mistakes during candid press conference. Something about having four other people on the payroll highly qualified to replace you can turn a man into an over-sharer.\n\nEagles sign Zach Ertz, Brent Celek and Lane Johnson to contract extensions. Eh, we already navigated a minefield of potential racial humor in the intro. Let's move on.\n\nMONICA M. DAVEY/Getty Images An emotional Terrell Owens, with J.J. Stokes\n\nMike Martz thinks it's ridiculous that Terrell Owens is a Hall of Fame finalist over Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt, he told Jim Thomas of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Unfortunately, the Hall doesn't let you or I vote, Coach.\n\nBrowns talk to Carson Wentz at Senior Bowl, Patriots to Glenn Gronkowski. Betcha the Browns talked to Lil' Gronk and the Patriots to Wentz, too, because the whole point of the Super Bowl is meetings between prospects and teams. When I am crowned King of Sports Journalism, writers who ask \"Did you talk to this team?\" questions at the Senior Bowl, knowing full well that everyone talks to everyone, will be forced to watch two hours of special-teams drills (one Gus Bradley practice, in other words) as punishment.\n\nRobert Griffin wants to play for the Cowboys, Yahoo's Charles Robinson reported. The Cowboys were also rumored to be interested in Johnny Manziel before his latest incident. And of course, Jason Garrett (who coached the Senior Bowl's North squad) spent the whole week talking to Carson Wentz. In summary, this is all a bunch of hooey.\n\nLast Call\n\nEric Risberg/Associated Press\n\nSome final thoughts from a hotel in San Francisco before this week descends into utter madness.\n\nThere's nothing funny about Johnny Manziel at this point. He's not a young man who \"doesn't get it,\" he's a young man who needs help. I hope he remains on an NFL roster next year, because while the NFL doesn't exactly earn A-plus grades as a support network, it's better than what he appears to have. Calvin Johnson has had a great career and has been a joy to watch and cover. Not every NFL player gets the chance to leave the game on his own terms, whatever those terms may be. May Johnson do what's best for Johnson, and may no player ever have to play a snap past the moment when he feels the pain and exhaustion are no longer worth it. The Pro Bowl does not need fixing. The Pro Bowl is frothy football-like entertainment programming. It's not for hardcore fans who read the fourth segment of a Super Bowl preview. It's for bored folks in taverns, channel flippers and fans like my nephew who truly dig the fact that Odell Beckham and Jarvis Landry are playing together and like the pop starlets performing the pregame show. And hey: the multiple fake punts and offensive players (like Beckham) playing defense kept things lively. The Pro Bowl is mildly fun, and nothing the NFL does to entice bigger stars or increase the competition level will make it more than mildly fun. Let it be. Carson Wentz had a fine Senior Bowl week, and I think he will be a first-round pick with the potential to be a fine quarterback. That said, the hype has gone off the rails already in some cities. \"If the Browns take Carson Wentz at No. 2 they'd be set for 15 years,'' an anonymous personnel expert told Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain Dealer. That's the kind of bold statement personnel types make when talking about someone else's team. The biggest problem with statements like these is that they are unfair to prospects like Wentz. No one should have to cope with the pressure of going from the FCS level to \"savior of a franchise\" status because some general manager wants to play mind games with his counterparts. This is the fourth Super Bowl I will cover live in five years. Each experience has been exhilarating, disorienting, exhausting and utterly amazing. Doing this for a living is a privilege, something I never imagined would happen 10 years ago when I was teaching math and writing quirky stat articles for Football Outsiders on the side. Just getting that out of the way in case you see me complaining about long bus rides to events on Twitter.\n\nMike Tanier covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.",

                    "body": "You hear it all the time. Football is a game of matchups.\n\nWe totally agree. So we have chosen eight crucial encounters (in no particular order) which we feel will have a major say when it comes to the Super Bowl 50 clash between the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos.\n\nWhile the Panthers are making their first Super Bowl appearance since 2003, the Broncos are back in this game for record-tying eighth time and the second time in three years. Of course, while that's a relatively short period of time, this is a much different Denver team under head coach Gary Kubiak. And they must find a way to knock off a talented Carolina squad that has lost just one game this season.\n\nCan it be done? Or will the Panthers walk away with their first NFL championship? These eight matchups may be enough to convince you one way or another.\n\nFor the first time in his stellar career, DeMarcus Ware will be playing in the season's biggest game. In two seasons with the Broncos, the 11-year veteran will have played in as many postseason games (four) than he did in his nine years with the Dallas Cowboys once he takes the field in Super Bowl 50.\n\nOn the other hand, Carolina Panthers left tackle Michael Oher is back in the Big Game for the second time in four years. In 2012 with the Baltimore Ravens, he started 15 of the team's 16 regular-season games at left tackle, then switched to right tackle for the team's finale and four-game postseason run -- culminating with a 34-31 win in Super Bowl XLVII. Oher played one more year in Baltimore, then wound up taking the free-agent route to Nashville when it appeared the Ravens weren't in a hurry to re-sign him.\n\nElizabeth Merrill of ESPN has an excellent retrospective look at Oher's journey to the NFL, documented in the motion picture \"The Blind Side\" and how a message from Panthers quarterback Cam Newton got him to Carolina following a disappointing season with the Titans in 2014. While Oher's overall grade (via Pro Football Focus) wasn't very high, he ranked 15th in the league at the tackle position in terms of pass blocking.\n\nChances are, he will have to play an exceptional game against Ware and the team that led the NFL with 52 sacks in 2015 and have tacked on seven more in two playoff games.\n\nCarolina Panthers All-Pro cornerback Josh Norman was one of the league's most talked-about defenders this season, as well as one of its best. The 2012 fifth-round pick enjoyed a breakout campaign this year, totaling 56 tackles and a team-high 18 passes defensed. Throw in four interceptions (two returned for scores), three forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries and Norman had a pretty complete 2015.\n\nOn the other hand, Denver Broncos wideout Demaryius Thomas racked up 105 catches for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, pretty impressive numbers overall. But there were also times he seemed to disappear, most notably twice against the New England Patriots and cornerback Logan Ryan. In two games vs. the Pats this season, including last Sunday's AFC title game clash, the talented wide receiver was targeted a combined 20 times and caught three passes for 48 yards.\n\nNot that he's appeared to need much help this season, but no doubt Norman and his cohorts in the Carolina secondary spent a little extra time watching Thomas' two games against New England. Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning has always had good rapport with the receiver and with two weeks to prepare, could lean on him more than he has the team's first two playoff games.\n\nAnd Norman will be waiting.\n\nThe 18-game resume for Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton in 2015 is daunting...and that's an understatement.\n\nThe fifth-year signal-caller completed 59.8 percent of his throws for 3,837 yards and 35 touchdowns compared to only 10 interceptions. Newton was sacked 33 times and lost four out of his five fumbles but he also ran the rock 636 times, 10 for scores.\n\nIn the postseason, a two-game sweep of the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals, produced a combined 80 points and eight offensive touchdowns. Newton hit on exactly 70 percent of his passes for 496 yards and three scores with only one interception. Add in 21 rushing attempts for 50 yards and two touchdowns and it has been amazing year for the Panthers' field general.\n\nKeeping Newton under wraps is far from a one-man task. But could Wade Phillips employ a spy on the talented signal-caller. In any case, we have opted to give Broncos inside linebacker Danny Trevathan the assignment. The rangy defender led Denver with 109 tackles, also knocked down six passes and totaled two interceptions (one returned for a touchdown).\n\nOf course, Trevathan will be one of many Broncos defenders busy trying to corral the NFL's likely MVP this season.\n\nThis clash could be worth the price of admission. But in reality this will be far more than a three-hour confrontation between two of the best in the business at their positions.\n\nDenver left guard Evan Mathis, discarded by the Philadelphia Eagles during the offseason, latched on with the Broncos and wound up playing 15 games -- making a dozen starts. He not only graded out as one of the top 10 guards in the league, no player at his position ranked higher when it came to blocking for the run.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolina Panthers defensive tackle Kawann Short enjoyed a breakout year, leading his team with 11 sacks while providing solid play against the run. The 2013 second-round pick graded out as the NFL's fourth-best defensive tackle this season, behind only Aaron Donald, Geno Atkins and Ndamukong Suh.\n\nMeanwhile, look for another interesting battle up front between Panthers defensive tackle Star Lotulelei and Broncos right guard Louis Vasquez as Denver looks to control the tempo of this contest with their running game.\n\nIn recent seasons, thanks to the play of New England's Rob Gronkowski and one-time New Orleans Saints/turned Seattle Seahawks tight end Jimmy Graham, it would be understandable if another player at their positions could be overlooked.\n\nHowever, it's hard to ignore what Carolina's Greg Olsen has done during his five-year stint with the Panthers after being obtained in a trade with the Chicago Bears in 2011. In four seasons in the Windy City, the 2007 first-round pick totaled 194 catches for 1,981 and 20 touchdowns, missing just two games.\n\nIn five seasons with Ron Rivera's club, Olsen has amassed an impressive 348 receptions for 4,311 yards and 29 scores. He's totaled 1,000-plus yards receiving each of these past two seasons and has not missed a game with the Panthers.\n\nOne Denver Broncos defender who may be assigned to slow down Olsen is strong safety T.J. Ward. The hard-hitting safety, injured in last week's conference title game, appears ready to take on the Panthers.\n\n\"I feel great,\" said Ward to Jeff Legwold of ESPN on Saturday. \"I'm just resting and making sure I'm healthy when it comes (to the Super Bowl). I'll definitely be ready to play.\"\n\nWard and free safety Darian Stewart, who was also injured in last week's AFC Championship Game win over New England, did not practice this week but both are expected to be available for the clash for the Panthers.\n\nThe bigger question may be if Ward is ready to slow down the Panthers' most consistent downfield target.\n\nThis could be the most crucial matchup of all, especially if Carolina Panthers center Ryan Kalil can handle Denver Broncos nose tackle Sylvester Williams one-on-one.\n\nWhile Ron Rivera's club finished second in the league in rushing, Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips spearheaded a unit that was third in the NFL against the run. Williams comes off an up-and-down year but his forte is still run defense, where he graded out above-average.\n\nOn the other hand, only three centers in the league graded out higher overall than Kalil this season and only Minnesota's Joe Berger and Dallas' Travis Frederick were better when it came to run blocking. Guards Andrew Norwell and Pro Bowler Trai Turner could also help with Williams if need be, although the Broncos defensive end combination of Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson are formidable as well.\n\nIf running backs Jonathan Stewart and Mike Tolbert, as well as quarterback Cam Newton, are to rack up their share of yards against Denver's defense, Kalil must come up big -- which is usually the case on a weekly basis.\n\nAs we like to remind everyone occasionally this time of the season, there has never been a punt returned for a touchdown in 49 previous Super Bowls.\n\nIn fact, the record for the longest punt return in this championship series belongs to San Francisco 49ers wide receiver John Taylor, who took back a kick 45 yards against the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII. If you recall, he was very busy late in that game with other matters -- such as catching the game-winning touchdown pass from Joe Montana in his team's 20-16 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nBut to this Super Bowl and the possible contributions of Carolina Panthers wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr., who in his nine-year NFL career has taken back four punts for scores. This season, Ginn averaged 10.3 yards on 22 punt returns and Carolina ranked 12th in the NFL in punt return average.\n\nMeanwhile, Denver Broncos punter Brinton Colquitt ranked near the bottom of the NFL in gross average (43.6) but his team finished 12th in the league in punt coverage.\n\nSounds like a fair fight. But will we indeed see some Super Bowl history?\n\nWho would have thought that after two playoff games this year that Carolina Panthers middle linebacker Luke Kuechly would have as many touchdowns as Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning would have scoring passes?\n\nThat's the reality of the red-hot Carolina Panthers and the determined Denver Broncos these days. The Panthers appear to be clicking on all cylinders while the Broncos are getting by with exceptional defense and the savvy of a legendary signal-caller.\n\nThen again, Manning hasn't thrown an interception in this postseason -- a far cry from the first nine games of 2015 when his pick total (17) was nearly twice as high as his number of touchdown passes (nine). And Carolina's star linebacker knows he and his team have a different kind of challenge ahead in Super Bowl 50.\n\n\"He's a guy that's got all kinds of calls,\" said Kuechly to Brian Haines of Fox Sports. \"You have to try and figure some out but at the end of the day you just have to do your job because I'm sure he's got fake (calls) and he's got real ones.\n\nKuechly wasn't done in his assessment of the NFL's five-time MVP.\n\n\"He's still Peyton. He's still up there. He's still got all the hand signals, the code words. He's adjusting everything and getting everybody lined up,\" Kuechly said. \"He's still Peyton. I don't care what anybody says. He's still got all his gestures and movements and it's fun to watch.\"\n\nBy this time next week, we will know just how much fun Kuechly and the rest of the Panthers defense had in dealing with one of the game's best offensive minds.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all player and team statistics come from Pro-Football-Reference and ESPN.com.

                    "body": "The picks are coming for Super Bowl 50, and most experts are predicting the Carolina Panthers to win their first Lombardi Trophy.\n\nOur SB Nation experts favor Carolina by a TK-1 margin, with free spirit PFT Commenter being the only one to pick the Denver Broncos. It's a similar consensus over at CBS Sports, with five of the seven writers taking the Panthers.\n\nThe Panthers are making their second trip to the big game after dismantling the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship. Cam Newton threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more, while the defense forced Carson Palmer into six turnovers. Carolina ran roughshod in the regular season with a 15-1 record, its only loss coming to the division rival Atlanta Falcons.\n\nOne concern for the Panthers is the injury to veteran linebacker Thomas Davis, who broke his forearm in the NFC Championship. He's hoping to play, although his status will be a question mark with such a short recovery window. Defensive end Jared Allen sat out the last game with a broken foot, but is expected to play in his first-ever Super Bowl.\n\nThe Broncos pulled out a nail-biting 20-18 win over the New England Patriots, making the Super Bowl for the second time in three years. They'll hope to have a better result this time -- Peyton Manning had no answer for the Legion of Boom as the Seattle Seahawks cruised to a 43-8 win in Super Bowl 48.\n\nThe Broncos' defense had an inspired performance in the AFC Championship, putting constant pressure on Tom Brady and never allowing him to get into rhythm. That pass rush will be tested against Newton and an underrated offensive line, so look for the trench battle to be one of the key matchups.\n\nThe 40-year-old Manning has settled into a game manager role at this point of his career, but he still has top-shelf weapons in Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders at wide receiver. However, Thomas has struggled with drops all season and Josh Norman is itching to shut down one of these receivers. The Panthers also have the league's fourth-best run defense, so it figures to be tough sledding for C.J. Anderson.\n\nTo win this game, the Broncos will need their defense to keep playing at a high level and possibly hope for some late-career magic from Manning. Not many experts predict that will happen, though.",

Time_Sports\n\n391 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Wade Phillips has been nothing but deferential this year when it comes to his top-ranked Denver Broncos defense.\n\nIt's his assistant coaches, he says, who teach the technique and spend the most time with players. And it's those players, guys like linebacker Von Miller and cornerback Aqib Talib, Phillips says, who truly make his scheme run. In his slow, Texas drawl, Phillips will say he's just, \"clanging the bell\" on the Broncos' defensive train.\n\nBut it's all just a front.\n\nRead Phillips' tweets -- yes, the 68-year-old three-time former NFL head coach is a prolific tweeter under the handle @sonofbum -- and listen closely to his recent news conferences, and you'll discover a brilliant defensive mind and a man who takes great pride in not just building a defensive scheme, but his ability to adapt it year to year, roster to roster.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSuper Bowl 50 matchups: Panthers TE Greg Olsen vs. Broncos safeties\n\n\"I don't understand the people that say, 'Hey, this is our scheme, and that guy can't play in it. The guy can play, he's a good player, but he can't play in our scheme,' \" Phillips said last week.\n\n\"Well, to me. There's something wrong with your scheme.\"\n\nAnd that, indeed, has been the secret to his success in his first year as Denver's defensive coordinator. He saw Talib and fellow corner Chris Harris and knew they were best suited to play man-to-man coverage. Phillips saw Miller and veteran pass rusher DeMarcus Ware, whom Phillips also coached with the Dallas Cowboys, and knew how he could aggressively send both off opposite edges while stunting defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson through the middle. Phillips saw two inside linebackers, Danny Trevathan and Brandon Marshall, who were strong against the run, but that he could trust to cover running backs on anything from screens to deep routes.\n\nPhillips inherited all of those players from the previous regime, when Jack Del Rio ran the defense. And while the unit was a good one, Phillips made it great. All season, players have praised his play calling and knack for knowing.\n\n\"You look at his track record and how many times has Wade gone to an organization, team and real fast done things?\" Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. \"It tells you what type of teacher he is.\"\n\nThe Broncos had 52 sacks in the regular season, most in the NFL, and then rode the defense to Super Bowl 50 after holding the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots to 34 total points in a pair of playoff victories. The performance against the Patriots was especially impressive as Broncos defenders hit quarterback Tom Brady 20 times and intercepted him twice.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe 50 greatest players in Super Bowl history\n\nIn the following days, Phillips took to Twitter to discuss the complicated art of blitzing -- perhaps a shot at analysts who said the Broncos rarely blitzed against the Patriots -- and later in the week gave a history lesson about the matchup zone coverage scheme. He might not have a Dick LeBeau-like reputation for confounding opposing offenses, but that doesn't mean Phillips' system is simple.\n\n\"I'm pretty confusing usually. We play a matchup zone, and people think it's man-to-man. Then we play man-to-man, and we play some basic zone. We started a long time ago,\" Phillips said.\n\nThat's how you know his \"aw shucks\" demeanor is just an act. This man knows football, and he learned it from his father, Bum Phillips, the former Houston Oilers and New Orleans Saints head coach who died in 2013. Bum Phillips' Oilers reached two AFC Championship Games in the 1970s, but both times lost to the Steel Curtain Steelers.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDon't be surprised if Broncos LB Von Miller is Super Bowl 50's breakout star\n\nNow Phillips, whose son Wes is a third-generation NFL coach as the tight ends assistant in Washington, is making his second Super Bowl trip as a coordinator but first since 1989, his first stint with the Broncos.\n\n\"My dad was my hero. Not just my dad -- he was also my high school coach and my college coach. I worked for him for 10 years as a defensive coach and defensive coordinator,\" Phillips said.\n\n\"Everything that I learned about football and about people and how to work with people was from him.\"\n\n***\n\nFollow Lindsay H.

                    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO - The all-time great quarterback potentially playing in his final game.\n\nThe out-of-nowhere team looking to become only the third Super Bowl champion to finish with an 18-1 record.\n\nThe polarizing passer looking to add a pro title to his already jam-packed resume that includes a college title and the Heisman Trophy.\n\nAnd the NFL's best defense trying to continue what it did in last week's AFC title game.\n\nWhen the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos touched down in nearby San Jose late Sunday afternoon, Super Bowl Week was officially underway.\n\nHere are 10 storylines about the 50th Super Bowl to watch:\n\n1. PEYTON'S LAST PARTY\n\nCombining regular season and the playoffs, Denver quarterback Peyton Manning has played in 292 games, compiling a 200-92 record (199-92 as a starter). He'll be appearing in his fourth Super Bowl (1-2 record).\n\nManning turns 40 next month and the Broncos have free agent-to-be Brock Osweiler waiting to take over so this is almost assuredly No. 18's final game in Denver.\n\nBut a subplot will be whether this will be Manning's final game, period. We say yes and the list of players who get to go out clutching the Lombardi Trophy is short and decorated, led by Denver personnel chief John Elway.\n\n2. STRENGTH VS. STRENGTH\n\nDenver's defense led the NFL in fewest yards allowed for the first time in franchise history.\n\nThe Broncos will face a Carolina offense that was second in rushing yards per game (142.6) and first in points per game (31.1).\n\nWhich unit gets to dictate will be critical. Carolina must win on first down so Denver can't scheme up pressure on third-and-long.\n\n3. ALL CAM, ALL THE TIME\n\nCarolina's Cam Newton will be the first Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback to start a Super Bowl since Oakland's Jim Plunkett in Super Bowl 18.\n\nNewton has emerged from a run first-run second-throw third player into a passer whose 35 touchdowns tosses were tied for second-most in the league with the Jaguars' Blake Bortles.\n\nNewton's personality - he's going to have fun playing and isn't afraid to show it - will rub some people the wrong way, but look for him to flourish on the early-week stage (in front of the microphone) and the Sunday-night stage (in front of a world-wide television audience).\n\n4. MILLER'S STAR TURN\n\nNewton was the top pick in the 2011 draft, but don't forget about the No. 2 pick. Denver selected Texas A&M's Von Miller.\n\nMiller has 60 sacks in 72 career regular season games. He took 58 games to reach 50 sacks, the third-fastest in league history.\n\nMiller missed Denver's Super Bowl loss to Seattle two years ago because of injury. He wants to be a difference-maker Sunday just like he was against New England (2 1/2 sacks and one interception).\n\n5. CAROLINA'S EMERGENCE\n\nThe Panthers were the seventh team to go 15-1 in the regular season and they've done better than Minnesota (1998), Pittsburgh (2004) and Green Bay (2011), which couldn't cash in on home-field advantage to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nIn our book, Carolina is the most unlikely Super Bowl participant since, well, Carolina in 2002. The Panthers were 7-9 in 2001, but improved to 11-5 in 2002, won at Philadelphia in the NFC title game and lost to New England in the big game.\n\n6. LONG-TIME, FIRST-TIME\n\nVeteran players who waited a long time for their first Super Bowl dot both rosters and they're always good for providing perspective.\n\nCarolina: The Panthers have seven players who are in their second decade of pro football and six are on their first Super Bowl-playing team - three 12th-year players (receiver Jerricho Cotchery, defensive tackle Dwan Edwards and defensive end Jared Allen), two 11th-year players (linebacker Thomas Davis and back-up quarterback Derek Anderson) and 10th-year cornerback Courtland Finnegan.\n\nDenver: The Broncos have six players with at least 10 years of experience. Appearing in their first Super Bowl will be 11th year defensive end DeMarcus Ware and two 10th-year players - guard Evan Mathis and tight end Owen Daniels.\n\n7. CASHING IN\n\nOne game won't make a big difference because players such as Miller, Trevathan and Malik Jackson on Denver and Josh Norman on Carolina will cash-in big time next month in free agency.\n\nBut what the Super Bowl will provide is a chance for fans of teams like the Jaguars to day-dream about what their team would look like if they acquired one of those stars.\n\n8. SURVIVING FIRST QUARTER\n\nCan Denver stay afloat in the first quarter? Seattle and Arizona weren't able to against Carolina.\n\nSeattle fell behind Carolina 14-0 in the opening four minutes and trailed 31-0 at halftime. The Seahawks got no closer than 31-21.\n\nArizona trailed 17-0 after the first quarter, 24-7 at halftime and 34-7 late in the third quarter. Carolina cruised to a 49-15 win.\n\n9. EXPECT TURNOVERS\n\nIn 18 games, Denver has 30 turnovers and Carolina a staggering 48 takeaways.\n\nKansas City and Arizona scored six defensive touchdowns apiece during the regular season but tied right behind them were Denver and Carolina with five touchdowns apiece.\n\nThe Panthers have added two more in the postseason (both by linebacker Luke Kuechly).\n\nThis hasn't been a woeful year for the NFL's officiating crews. Calls have been missed - a flag wasn't warranted. And calls have been missed - the flag shouldn't have stayed in Mr. Official's pocket.\n\nClete Blakeman gets the Big Whistle for the Super Bowl and all eyes will be on him and league officiating czar Dean Blandino, who will be in charge of replay reviews, to see if they can avoid the biggest black eye of them all, a championship-size mistake.",

We going to have today, maybe, to have a little fun but it's a business trip. It's not no vacation. We're ready to work to get the job done.\"\n\nThe Panthers and Broncos both largely put their game-plans together in practice back home, leaving just some fine tuning ahead of the big game.\n\nDenver, playing in their record-tying eighth Super Bowl game, are going for their third Lombardi Trophy.\n\nCarolina are aiming for their first championship in their second appearance in the Super Bowl.\n\n(Editing by Andrew Both)",

                    "title": "Stories abound as Super Bowl week kicks off",
                    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The Super Bowl is back in California for the first time in 13 years, and the 50th battle for the Lombardi Trophy offers a dynamic matchup between the Panthers and Broncos.\n\nBoth teams arrived last night, and the week of festivities begin tonight with the first primetime edition of Super Bowl Media Day.\n\nAs always, there is no shortage of storylines in the lead-up to Sunday's game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nThe Panthers and Broncos play an old-school brand of physical, intimidating football, and Panthers quarterback Cam Newton's rapid ascension yields a new-school twist.\n\nHere's what's worth keeping an eye on this week:\n\nSuper Cam\n\nNewton will almost certainly win the MVP, which means he'll have a chance to join Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, Emmitt Smith, Steve Young and Kurt Warner as the seventh player in history to double up as the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nFrom start to (possibly) finish, this has been the year of Newton and the Panthers, and the quarterback has legitimized himself as one of the most dominant offensive forces in the league. That's been made all the more impressive by the relative lack of big-name weapons around him, as wide receiver Steve Smith left in 2014, running back DeAngelo Williams departed in 2015 and wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin tore his ACL in August.\n\nBut Newton led the Panthers to 14 consecutive regular-season wins and 17 victories in 18 games to this point. And he has completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 3,837 yards, 35 touchdowns and just 10 interceptions while running 132 times for 636 yards and 10 scores.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 245-pounder is a menace on third down, too, with 13 touchdowns (second most in the NFL) and a league-high 25 conversions on the ground (more than twice as many as all but four players).\n\nHowever, Newton's on-field brilliance has been met with widespread criticism from the \"what are we supposed to tell the children?\" crowd, who can't understand that football is meant to also be fun.\n\nGranted, the dab is insufferable, but there isn't a defense on the planet that can make him stop. Unfortunately, during a week like this, that storyline will get extra airtime from the entertainment media.\n\nOld man Peyton\n\nBroncos quarterback Peyton Manning told Bill Belichick after the AFC Championship Game this might be his \"last rodeo,\" so with a win, he has a chance to go out on top like his boss, John Elway.\n\nAt this point, Manning's arm strength resembles Archie's more than his own, but his supporting cast, both offensively and defensively, is about as strong as it's ever been in his 18th season. Manning's Super Bowl history is checkered, but he could join his brother, Eli, and become the 12th quarterback to win a pair of Super Bowls.\n\nBut in Manning's two losses, he threw a pick-6 on a decisive drive against the Saints in 2009 and was embarrassed by the Seahawks in 2013, which was tied for the third most lopsided Super Bowl in history. Elway knows that feeling, too.\n\nOh, and there's the HGH storyline. The NFL has announced it's investigating Manning's alleged receipt of an HGH delivery in 2011, while the 39-year-old has denied ever using the PED in the fallout of the Al Jazeera report. That subplot has been largely swept under the rug over the last month, but Manning can't hide from the allegations during four consecutive days at a podium this week.\n\nRoger that\n\nSome 367 days ago, Roger Goodell claimed that he's available to the media every day of the year. In a conservative estimate, Goodell has fallen short of that by about 350 interviews, but he gets his next chance Friday to stand before the masses.\n\nDeflategate will remain on the table, now and forever, as well as the league's apparent investigation into Manning's wife's HGH shipments. The \"Concussion\" movie will likely be addressed. It also seems fair to inquire about Greg Hardy's tone deaf remarks in the aftermath of his suspension.\n\nBut remember last year? Goodell was asked 28 questions, but only one Boston media member was called upon when droves wanted answers about Deflategate. Goodell's representatives instead doled out microphones to those who asked questions about the NFL's improved technology and the carrot it continues to dangle in front of the London audience. And this was when Goodell wasn't yucking it up with a junior reporter about their Play 60 mission.\n\nSo yeah, everyone would love to hear Goodell give genuine, informative responses about the league's shortcomings, but the reality is he'll probably spent the better portion of 45 minutes talking about how he and the league brought football back into the Los Angeles market.\n\nAnd don't forget the game\n\nAh yes, the game. The Panthers and Broncos try to kick in their opponents' organs for 60 minutes, and the Panthers' offense likes to get nasty, too. If you like to watch teams line up with the intention of beating the heck out of one another, this is the week for you.\n\nThis is a pretty cool week for 33-year-old pass rushers Jared Allen (Panthers) and Demarcus Ware (Broncos), who are making their first trips to the Super Bowl.\n\nKeep an eye on a couple local angles. Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly, a Boston College product, signed a five-year, $62 million contract extension this season. Kuechly, 24, is younger than both Dont'a Hightower, 25, and Jamie Collins, 26, but they'll be arguing for contracts in that range in the next year.\n\nSpeaking of money, Panthers cornerback Josh Norman may very well be the best at the position, and he's scheduled to be a free agent in March. Norman and Broncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders will have the best battle on the perimeter in the game.\n\nBroncos cornerback Aqib Talib spent a year and a half with the Patriots. Former Pats second-round pick Ras-I Dowling could potentially play the role of Talib on the Panthers' practice squad.",

There will be a million people out here.\"\n\nAs the event went into full swing, Broncos cheerleaders signed autographs, and former players made predictions about the outcome of next Sunday's Super Bowl. The rally also featured an appearance by Miles the Mascot.\n\nBut celebrating with devoted fans from the Mile High City was the motivation for several fans who showed up for the rally.\n\n\"I'm feeling that Mile High energy,\" said Jason Phelan, a 30-year-old salesman from Denver. \"I would just love to see them bring a trophy home. I think they deserve it, and we have a good chance.\"\n\nAbove the crowd chanting \"Go, Broncos,\" Miguel Sifuentes, 37, waved a massive, homemade Broncos flag. He said the flag will travel with him to California this week when he cheers on the team at the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We've got to do our thing in the stands, and they've got to do their thing on the field,\" he said.\n\nFans who aren't attending the game turned out at the rally to gear up for their own celebrations.\n\nTate Gilpin, a 28-year-old Denver resident, said he and his friends will unite in orange at their annual Super Bowl viewing party.\n\n\"The fans are going to have an impact,\" he said. \"If you're not a true fan, don't be in the room with me during the game.\"",

For years, he's donned an orange tuxedo for the games. He's even been featured on banners around Denver - showing his Bronco pride. And when they won a Super Bowl spot a week ago , he was celebrating with friends atop a party bus in the Mile High parking lot.\n\nThese fans may have left Denver, but this week, Denver came to them. It's just like being back home again.\n\n\"It was kind of fun to come to our adopted home town and have our home town come to us,\" said Tom.\n\nWe also stopped by the NFL fan experience, where fans could try on giant Broncos helmets, pose with cardboard cutouts of Manning, even play football. Broncos fans from Denver and California alike described the excitement surrounding all the events.",

                    "title": "Constructing a champion - How the Denver Broncos were built",
                    "body": "Since Peyton Manning arrived in Denver four years ago, the Broncos have consistently been a Super Bowl contender, including a trip to the big game two years in Super Bowl XLVIII against the Seattle Seahawks. But unlike that Super Bowl run, which was mainly orchestrated by Manning and a juggernaut offense, the Broncos are the 2015 AFC champions largely due to a suffocating defense and roster built with balance.\n\nThe Broncos have been very active in free agency, filling out the roster with cornerstone players like defensive end Demarcus Ware, wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders and cornerback Aqib Talib. But the NFL Draft has been a critical step to the construction of the AFC champs with 22 players on the roster that Denver drafted (two more than the Panthers), including five first-round picks. Team-building is a delicate balance between free agents and draft picks and executive vice president/general manager and Broncos legend John Elway has walked the fine line well.\n\nAnother key difference in this year's Broncos team is the coaching staff as Denver and former head coach John Fox mutually agreed to part ways after last season. To create better cohesion between the coaching staff and front office, Elway hired Gary Kubiak as head coach, another familiar face as he previously served as backup quarterback (1983-91) and offensive coordinator (1995-2005) in Denver.\n\nMEN AT THE TOP\n\nFollowing the disastrous Josh McDaniels era, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen added Elway to the front office in 2011. The move was met with skepticism as some saw the hire as a public relations move for the fans. However, it became clear very quickly that Elway was more than just a spokesman or token figure head, the Broncos were going to be built with a blueprint designed by the quarterback who won the franchise its only two Super Bowls.\n\nOnce Elway took over the day-to-day, he didn't insist on a complete overhaul of the player personnel department. Instead, he kept most of the football operations staff intact, adding several experienced decision-makers from the outside, including Tom Heckert, former general manager of the Cleveland Browns.\n\nFIVE MOVES THAT GOT THEM HERE\n\nTwo years ago, the Broncos advanced to the Super Bowl with a record-breaking offense led by Manning, but it was no match for the Seahawks No. 1-ranked defense as Seattle dominated Denver in Super Bowl XLVIII, 43-8. Having a future Hall of Fame quarterback at the helm was obviously important, but, as the old adage says, defense wins championships. A few weeks after that loss, Elway committed over $100 million in free agency to Talib, Ware and T.J. Ward and continued to focus on defensive prospects in the draft.\n\nYes, Elway is a former quarterback and offensive thinker by trade, but since he was hired as a member of the Broncos' front office in 2011, Denver has drafted a defensive player with their first pick in the draft each of the last five years and eight defensive players on the roster are former top-40 draft picks. Elway and his staff have also found several late round or undrafted gems, including cornerback Chris Harris, who has made the Pro Bowl the last two years.\n\nAnd the final piece to the puzzle was Wade Phillips, who was hired as defensive coordinator prior to the 2015 season. The year the Broncos lost to the Seahawks in the Super Bowl, the Denver defense finished 19th in the NFL. But that ranking improved to third in 2014 and No. 1 in 2015 under Phillips, leading the league in total yards allowed (283.1), sacks (52), forced fumbles (25) and defensive scores (four).\n\nCORE PLAYERS\n\nThe core of the Broncos roster is a balance of home-grown draft picks, wise free agent signings and a few undrafted discoveries.\n\nManning, Ware and Talib were all signed to lucrative free agent deals on Elway's watch, along with several other important yet under-the-radar additions like linebacker Brandon Marshall and guard Louis Vasquez (both chosen as Pro Bowl alternates in 2015). Wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and offensive tackle Ryan Clady are the two core players who were on the roster prior to Elway, although Clady missed all of the 2015 seasons due to a torn ACL.\n\nThrough the draft, the Broncos have used high draft picks to find core players, including Miller (No. 2 overall, 2011), Derek Wolfe (No. 36 overall, 2012) and Sylvester Williams (No. 28, 2013) in the defensive front-seven. And the franchise has hit on several late round or undrafted players in the bargain bin like Harris (undrafted), Malik Jackson (No. 137 overall, 2012) and Danny Trevathan (No. 188 overall, 2012).\n\nDEPTH FINDS\n\nA player who may or may not be the future of the franchise at quarterback, Brock Osweiler proved to be a valuable member of the Broncos this season, recording a 5-2 record as a starter while Manning was out with injuries. Osweiler was drafted in the second round of the 2012 NFL Draft and will be a free agent after the Super Bowl.\n\nDenver ranked middle of the pack in rushing this season, but are getting bang for their buck with undrafted running back C.J. Anderson (2013), who has rushed for 1,500-plus yards combined the last two seasons. Although neither Anderson nor Ronnie Hillman (No. 67 overall, 2012) are core players, they create a tandem backfield that gets the job done more times than not.\n\nSeveral other members of the Broncos' roster aren't household names, but have been contributors on the path to the Super Bowl. Players like pass rusher Shaquil Barrett (undrafted), cornerback Kayvon Webster (No. 90 overall, 2013) and safety David Bruton (No. 114 overall, 2009) and free agent finds like defensive tackle Vance Walker.\n\nGRADING THE DRAFT\n\nWhile free agent additions might be the backbone to the Broncos' roster, the team's success on draft weekend has been equally as important to Denver playing in Super Bowl 50.\n\nDating back to 2010, the Broncos have drafted very well with their first pick in the draft: wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (2010), linebacker Von Miller (2011), defensive tackle Derek Wolfe (2012), defensive tackle Sylvester Williams (2013), cornerback Bradley Roby (2014) and defensive end Shane Ray (2015).\n\nWith the exception of Ray, who was a nickel rusher as a rookie in 2015, the Broncos' first pick in the draft since 2010 have each been key starters on the current squad. Roby technically started only four games this past season, but his playing time is near equal to a starter due to the amount of nickel packages.\n\nThe Broncos have been far from perfect on draft weekend. They swung and missed on running back Montee Ball (No. 58 overall, 2013) and wide receiver Cody Latimer (No. 56, 2014) has taken longer than expected to develop. But Elway and his staff deserve credit for their work through the draft, especially considering they haven't drafted in the top-20 picks since 2011.\n\nFRONT OFFICE VIEW\n\nElway was a Super Bowl-winning quarterback on the field and he might be a Super Bowl-winning executive off the field if the Broncos can pull the upset over the Panthers in Super Bowl 50. And if that happens, his accomplishments as a general manager will have been earned through hard work, preparation and talent -- just like his accomplishments as a quarterback.\n\n\"Really, what I was drawing off and have been drawing off, is my experience in my career,\" Elway said. \"When we won those two Super Bowls, what was the formula? The formula was to play good defense, and offensively, it was about running the ball.\"\n\nSome will say that it doesn't take talent to open a checkbook and write down numbers and that would be correct. However, Elway has been more than an ATM or figure head -- he has had a plan since the day he took office. And while it hasn't always been pretty, that plan has the Broncos planning for the ultimate prize on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\n--Dane Brugler is a Senior Analyst for NFLDraftScout.com, distributed in partnership with The Sports Xchange and CBSSports.com.",

There will be a million people out here.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Fans celebrated the Denver Broncos heading to Super Bowl 50\n\nAs the event went into full swing, Broncos cheerleaders signed autographs, and former players made predictions about the outcome of next week's Super Bowl. The rally also featured an appearance from Miles the Mascot.\n\nBut celebrating with devoted fans from the Mile High City was the motivation for several fans who showed up for the rally.\n\n\"I'm feeling that Mile High energy,\" said Jason Phelan, a 30-year-old salesman from Denver. \"I would just love to see them bring a trophy home. I think they deserve it, and we have a good chance.\"\n\nAbove the crowd chanting \"Go, Broncos\" Miguel Sifuentes, 37, waved a massive, homemade Broncos flag. He said the flag will travel with him to California this week when he cheers on the Broncos at the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We've got to do our thing in the stands, and they've got to do their thing on the field,\" he said.\n\nFans who aren't attending the game turned out at the rally to gear up for their own celebrations.\n\nTate Gilpin, a 28-year-old Denver resident, said he and his friends will unite in orange at their annual Super Bowl viewing party.\n\n\"The fans are going to have an impact,\" he said. \"If you're not a true fan, don't be in the room with me during the game.\"",

We're ready to work to get the job done.\"\n\nThe Panthers and Broncos both largely put their game-plans together in practice back home, leaving just some fine tuning ahead of the big game.\n\nDenver, playing in their record-tying eighth Super Bowl game, are going for their third Lombardi Trophy.\n\nCarolina are aiming for their first championship in their second appearance in the Super Bowl.\n\nReuters",

                    "title": "What Advanced Stats Tell Us About Super Bowl 50 Matchup",
                    "body": "Super Bowl 50 marks a fitting matchup between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers -- the top seeds for their respective conferences. Not surprisingly, both teams boast some of the league's best statistics.\n\nCarolina ranked fourth in overall DVOA, according to Football Outsiders, for example, while Denver isn't far behind at eighth. The Panthers boast the top cumulative rating, according to Pro Football Focus, and Denver was third overall.\n\nThe Dream Matchup\n\nIn the Captain Obvious department, Super Bowl 50 is a matchup between the league's best offense and top defense. That much was evident during championship weekend alone, as the Panthers throttled a good Arizona Cardinals defense, while the Broncos suffocated the New England Patriots.\n\nDenver has been touted as the No. 1 defense for much of the season, so there is little surprise in a strong postseason performance. What might be news, though -- considering how well-touted Arizona and Pittsburgh offenses were during the season, at any rate -- is the fact Carolina's offense was, by far, the best-rated offense over at Pro Football Focus.\n\nThose are raw ratings, to be fair, but it's going to be fun to watch Carolina quarterback Cam Newton take on linebacker Von Miller and that vaunted Denver defense.\n\nThat Broncos pass rush was all the difference in the victory against New England. Miller was a force of nature in the AFC Championship Game, abusing Patriots offensive linemen en route to three sacks, another quarterback hit and four more quarterback pressures.\n\nHe spearheaded a pass rush that harassed Tom Brady into oblivion. Is more of the same in store against Carolina?\n\nAll in all, Carolina's pass blocking ranked just 21st by DVOA standards, according to Football Outsiders, allowing an adjusted sack rate of 6.8 percent. That's not exactly encouraging considering New England ranked 18th and had healthy starters against Denver.\n\nDenver, as you might imagine, boasted the top-ranked defensive line with an 8.1 percent sack rate, according to Football Outsiders.\n\nFortunately, the offensive line has been a strength for the Panthers in recent weeks, including solid play from an unexpected source -- left tackle Michael Oher. Though he had a negative overall grade from Pro Football Focus, Oher improved his pass blocking after being moved to the left side this season.\n\nThe big lineman has protected Cam Newton's blind side well in the playoffs, having allowed zero quarterback pressures in two games.\n\nShare Tweet Embed\n\nOher's counterpart, Mike Remmers, has also kept Newton clean on the right side through the playoffs. If he can manage a similar performance with Miller lining up across from him, the Panthers will have a massive advantage on offense.\n\nNewton enjoyed the eighth-most time to throw at quarterback with 2.85 seconds per dropback on average, according to Pro Football Focus. He was among the leaders in time to attempt (2.65 seconds) and time to scramble (5.40), too.\n\nIf the Broncos can disrupt Newton's timing like they did against Brady, the presumptive MVP could find himself scuffling in turn. Of course, Newton has a few things Brady lacks, most notably the elusiveness of a squirrel and the speed of a gazelle.\n\nCarolina's offense isn't predicated on Newton freelancing, but he is one of the few quarterbacks in the league who can play right into a defense's game plan and still make his opponent look silly.\n\nTurning Back the Clock\n\nThere is, of course, a narrative surrounding Peyton Manning's play. Age has caught up to him at 39, after all, and he can't throw the ball deep anymore. Right?\n\nWell, that may be half-true.\n\nManning threw deep passes 12.7 percent of the time, smack dab in the middle of the pack among NFL starting quarterbacks. His relative penchant for throwing deep is the reason receivers Demaryius Thomas (2.20) and Emmanuel Sanders (2.10) are both in the top 20 in yards per route run.\n\nThose deep passes were plentiful considering he couldn't complete them. Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis doesn't think Manning has lost arm strength -- or much else -- either, per Ben Swanson of DenverBroncos.com:\n\nI mean, he's going to go down as -- if not the greatest -- one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play this game and you don't just lose that overnight. You look at some people talking about his arm strength, but in the Patriots game, it looked pretty good to me. He looked good throwing the ball to me, from watching the game.\n\nWe have to understand that as a defense, that he's a true competitor. He's a guy that's going to come and want to do whatever he can to make sure that his team leaves that field victorious so we have to make sure that we're doing whatever we can in our power to make sure that that doesn't happen.\n\nAmong quarterbacks with at least 20 deep passes, only teammate Brock Osweiler and rookie Marcus Mariota had worse completion percentages on throws over 20 yards, per Pro Football Focus. The AFC Championship Game highlighted this issue -- Manning just missed on several long balls, including a couple of them just out of reach in the end zone.\n\nAll that to say the Broncos will take their shots against that depleted Panthers secondary. Whether Manning can be on target with a few of them could be one of the biggest deciding factors on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nThat is if Carolina gives him time to throw, at any rate.\n\nWhereas Newton had a ton of time to throw on average, Manning was in the opposite boat this year -- he had the least time to throw among all qualifying quarterbacks at 2.31 seconds, per Pro Football Focus.\n\nMuch of that has to do with the nature of the offense -- Manning tends to get rid of the ball quickly -- but he also had just 3.11 seconds before getting sacked on average.\n\nWho's Cam Throwing To?\n\nSpeaking of going deep, Ted Ginn Jr. is known best as a deep threat. Counting on him to make a big play down the field might be fool's gold, however.\n\nAmong receivers with 49 or more deep targets, Ginn posted the 10th-worst catch percentage in the entire league -- he caught just 26.1 percent of his deep targets this season. Of course, he is infamously butter-fingered on such passes, dropping five of his 23 opportunities to tie for the most in the league.\n\nFortunately, none of that may matter. Ginn has been huge for the Panthers, and he doesn't need to catch a deep pass to make a big difference in the game. If Denver cornerback Chris Harris Jr. is tasked with stopping Ginn, though, it might be a long night.\n\nConsistently one of the most underrated players in the league, Pro Football Focus rated Harris the third-best cornerback in the land. But it's far likelier he will be lining up elsewhere for much of the game. More on that in a minute.\n\nScott Cunningham/Getty Images Stopping Greg Olsen will be key for Denver's defense.\n\nThe biggest question is whether the Broncos can stop tight end Greg Olsen. Though he's not quite Rob Gronkowski at tight end, Carolina's leading receiver is nearly as unstoppable.\n\nHe was a focal point for Arizona's defense -- at least if head coach Bruce Arians' pre-game comments were to be believed -- yet Olsen ran wild in the NFC Championship Game to the tune of eight receptions for 113 yards in a game that had all but gotten away from the Panthers.\n\nThe Broncos have had trouble stopping tight ends this season, including Gronkowski's eight-catch, 144-yard performance against them that included a touchdown. Denver bracketed Gronk wherever possible, but primary coverage depended on where he lined up.\n\nOlsen ran roughly half his snaps out of the slot this season. Guess who the league's top slot cornerback was? That would be Mr. Harris, who allowed a passer rating of just 43.4 on passes thrown his direction while covering the slot receiver, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nOf course, a 6'6\", 250-pound tight end against a 5'10\", 190-pound cornerback isn't exactly a fair physical fight, but the Broncos at least have a competent cover man to blanket Olsen out of the slot.\n\nThe Bates Motel\n\nFew receivers have escaped the Bates Motel after checking in.\n\nJosh Norman has been great this season, rating out as one of the league's top cornerbacks and developing a reputation as a shutdown corner. While the latter may not be quite true -- Carolina gives him help in tougher matchups.\n\nShare Tweet Embed\n\nNorman has allowed just two touchdowns and a 54.0 passer rating on passes thrown his direction this season, earning him the third-best coverage grade among his peers, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nThe question is who will draw Norman's attention this week. The easy answer is Demaryius Thomas, who is Denver's most dangerous receiver.\n\nThomas has come down with a case of the postseason dropsies, though -- not terribly surprising considering his 12 drops in the regular season, third-most in the league -- and he is best in catch-and-run situations where the Broncos get him the ball in space.\n\nEmmanuel Sanders, meanwhile, is the more polished Broncos receiver -- at the very least, he has rated higher than his counterpart in the passing department over at Pro Football Focus for the past couple of seasons -- who has proven to be a threat anywhere on the field.\n\nThe Panthers could decide to leave Norman on an island with Sanders and crowd Thomas so he doesn't get loose on screens and short passes.\n\nRunning Backs are People, Too\n\nOf course, the Super Bowl will feature some running of the ball -- or at least attempts to do so. Denver has been particularly eager to establish the run, perhaps in part to preserve Manning's arm as games and the season have gone on.\n\nUnlike their first meeting, the Broncos didn't get much going against the Patriots. C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman combined to average just under 3.3 yards per carry, and that includes a 30-yard scamper from the former.\n\nJustin Edmonds/Getty Images Can Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson get things going against Carolina's dominant front?\n\nBacked by stud linebackers Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis, Carolina's defensive line was ranked fourth in DVOA against the run, according to Football Outsiders. That unit has given up just 106 yards in two games, though David Johnson had moderate success in a blowout loss.\n\nJust three defensive lines ranked higher than Carolina against the run, and one of those belonged to Denver.\n\nThough Pittsburgh's Fitzgerald Toussaint and New England's Steven Jackson weren't exactly marquee opponents, the Broncos defense has allowed just 2.6 yards per carry to running backs during the playoffs.\n\nAll that to say, Anderson, Hillman and Jonathan Stewart might be stuck in the proverbial mud in Super Bowl 50.\n\nJust Play the Game\n\nSo what can we glean from all these fancy stats? If the game was played in a vacuum -- or perhaps a Madden simulation -- it could become a defensive slugfest.\n\nIf the Broncos can continue dominating the defensive trenches and the Panthers take away the run, we could be looking at a final combined score in the 30s.\n\nOr two weeks of scheming might render any and all statistics irrelevant. Here's to hoping for a great game regardless.\n\nFollow @AlexMiglio",

                    "title": "Mapping Out Super Bowl 50 Loyalty",
                    "body": "When it comes to rooting for a Super Bowl 50 team, most people go by their gut rather than geography.\n\nDo you feel compelled by Peyton Manning's likely swan song? Go with the Broncos.\n\nAre you more into the dabbin' energy of Cam Newton? Go with the Panthers.\n\nStill bitter that you're team got eliminated? Watch the commercials.\n\nDespite all that, you might be interested to see where the general public lies on the loyalty landscape. While there aren't too many scientific polls that determine exactly how much of the population roots for one team over another, social media provides us at least a broad picture.\n\nA lot more people list the Broncos as an \"interest\" on their Facebook page than list the Panthers. Nearly 8 million Americans mention the Broncos among their interests, while about 3.5 million mention the Panthers as an interest. This makes sense given that the Broncos have a much deeper history, which has allowed them to develop a sizeable fanbase over time. Another thing driving the Broncos fan surplus is that the Broncos are more familiar with deep postseason runs and will be appearing in their eighth Super Bowl, while the Panthers will be making just their second trip to the championship game.\n\nAfter categorizing the Facebook data by state we found that only two states, the Carolinas, clearly have more Panthers fans than Broncos fans. This wasn't terribly surprising given that Broncos fans make up about 70 percent of total Broncos and Panthers fans.\n\nThe interactive map below is based off each state's total amount of Broncos and Panthers fans. It shows what percentage of fans each state has devoted to each team. States where the Broncos hold more than 80 percent of the fans are shaded dark orange, states where the Broncos make up 60-80 percent of fans are shaded in a lighter orange, states where Broncos fans make up 40-60 percent (meaning there isn't a very clear cut majority one way or the other) are hardly shaded at all, and states where Broncos fans make up less than 40 percent (in other words, where the Panthers are clearly favorited) are shaded blue.\n\nThis map just shows us that in most states there are more people interested in the Broncos than the Panthers. But it tells us nothing of how each team's fans are distributed. To do that, we looked at what percentage of fans each state holds for both teams. For example, in Indiana the Broncos have about 160,000 fans and the Panthers have about 66,000 fans (via Facebook). While the Broncos have a very clear majority based off raw amounts, the percentage of Broncos fans that reside in Indiana is barely any different than the percentage of Panthers fans in that state. The 160,000 Broncos fans in Indiana make up 2.01 percent of the total amount of Broncos fans in America, and the 66,000 Panthers fans in Indiana make up 1.9 percent of the total amount of Panthers fans in America.\n\nThe interactive map below show what percentage of Broncos and Panthers fans each state holds. It also shows each state's difference between the teams in percentage-change terms.\n\nThe distribution shows heavy geographic bias. Even on a percentage basis, Broncos fans dominate every state west of Arkansas. But east of Arkansas, nearly every state is titled in favor of the Panthers. Aside from Florida, the Southeast is Panthers country.\n\nWhile raw data and percentage distributions give us a good idea of where fans for both teams reside, they still don't really tell us who each state will root for in the Super Bowl. Many people who show interest in an organization on Facebook are merely casual fans. And casual fans can often be easily swayed.\n\nSure, there might be a significantly greater number of Broncos \"fans\" in Michigan than there are Panthers fans. But many of these are probably also Detroit Lions fans. And if the Lions aren't playing, their favoritism toward any other NFL team is very slight. When it comes to the Super Bowl, and the context is either root for the Broncos or root for the Panthers, it isn't unreasonable to think that many in Michigan will root for University of Michigan alum and Panthers wide receiver Devin Funchess to catch a game-winning touchdown. (Conversely, you could also argue that they will root for the Broncos because former Wolverine Michael Schofield plays for Denver, but casual fans usually don't even know the names of offensive lineman.)\n\nBased off arbitrary judgment and emotional reasoning, we've created a map that shows how we think each state would -- or should -- root. Reasons for each state's alleged fandom range from proximity to media bias to holding the birthplace of each team's superstars. Feel free to click around and tell us in the comments whether you agree or disagree with our choice for each state.\n\nWhen going off raw data devoid of any context, we expect only two to five states to root for the Panthers. But since showing \"interest\" on Facebook isn't nearly the same as being a diehard fan, we expect many of these Broncos \"fans\" will cheer for the Panthers.\n\nOur last map, based on our opinionated judgment, shows 23 states for the Panthers and 27 for the Broncos. If we translate those results in presidential electoral votes, the Broncos would win 277-261. Which means that although we still think that most people will be rooting for the Broncos, the Panthers are within a major swing state of closing the gap.\n\n* * *",

I recap the season with some outside help.\n\nWe are only one week away from the Super Bowl. The Broncos travel to Santa Clara on Sunday in hopes of winning the franchise's third championship.\n\nIt was not an easy task getting there. This team has gone through quite a bit to get where they are. From offensive line struggles to a switch at quarterback near the halfway point among various changes. But it got the Broncos to a 12-4 record, another AFC West title, the No. 1 seed, and a Super Bowl birth.\n\nIn my opinion, this has all the takes of being quite the story to remember if they take care of business in the big game.\n\nWith the Super Bowl just around the corner, I thought this would be an opportune time to recap the entire season. Starting in Week 4, I started this little segment here on Predominantly Orange called Broncos Fanzone, where I interview Broncos fans and/or writers from various places.\n\nWhat a way to kick off Super Bowl week then by bringing them back for this new segment. Each one is going to cover a week of the season from Week One to the AFC Championship Game and we are all going to give our favorite moment and MVP if the Broncos won the game. If the game ended in a loss, the person will be talking about a positive moment, if possible, from the game itself.\n\nLet us get started. We first will take a look at the Week 1 meeting with the Baltimore Ravens, covered by yours truly.",

The Broncos defeated the Oakland Raiders 20-17 in the AFC championship game on New Year's Day of 1978 and were going to New Orleans to face the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XII.\n\nAfter 17 seasons of futility, the Broncos had suddenly found a place in pro football's sun.\n\n\"The fans were painting their houses and cars orange,\" Turner said as he remembered his days with the Broncos. \"I've never seen a city get so wrapped up in a game like that.\"\n\nTurner's previous experience had been as a member of the New York Jets team that shocked the Baltimore Colts 16-7 in Super Bowl III in Miami. Turner accounted for 10 points in the Jets' victory behind quarterback Joe Namath. In those days before the merger, it was the NFL against the American Football League, and New York's upset victory ended the NFL supremacy.\n\n\"They laughed at us when we took the field,\" Turner said of the attitude of the NFL backers.\n\nIt was a case of the last laugh being best.\n\nThe Broncos didn't have much to laugh about in Super Bowl XII. They entered the game as decided underdogs. Quarterback Craig Morton was hobbled with hip and knee problems, and backup Norris Weese finished the game. The Broncos committed eight turnovers: four interceptions and four lost fumbles.\n\nDallas quarterback Roger Staubach completed 17-of-25 passes for 183 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe Cowboys took a 13-0 lead before Turner's 47-yard field goal got the Broncos on the scoreboard early in the third quarter. Running back Rob Lytle scored a touchdown, getting the Broncos within 10 points late in the third quarter, but it was too little, too late.\n\nBilly Thompson, a Broncos safety, remembers thinking he had been on the field the entire game because of the turnovers. But he also has another memory.\n\n\"At the end of the game, the Broncos' fans gave us a standing ovation,\" Thompson said. \"I'll never forget that.\"\n\n\"They (the Cowboys) were better than us, no question,\" Turner said, adding that Broncos coach \"Red Miller had taken a fractured team and coached it into the Super Bowl.

You don't forget those memories.\"\n\nOffense: WR Jack Dolbin, LT Andy Mauer, LG Tom Glassic, C Mike Montler, RG Paul Howard, RT Claudie Minor, TE Riley Odoms, WR Haven Moses, QB Craig Morton, RB Rob Lytle, RB Jon Keyworth.\n\nDefense: DE Barney Chavous, NT Rubin Carter, DE Lyle Alzado, OLB Bob Swenson, ILB Randy Gradishar, ILB Joe Rizzo, OLB Tom Jackson, CB Louis Wright, S Billy Thompson, S Bernard Jackson, CB Steve Foley.",

                    "body": "Local high school coaches were split down the middle on who will win Super Bowl 50.\n\nThe AFC champion Denver Broncos were the sentimental choice of many with it expected to be Peyton Manning's last game as a professional quarterback. Several of the coaches talked about how tough a matchup Carolina quarterback Cam Newton presents with his ability to run and pass.\n\nMost believe it will be a close game with the coaches raving about both teams' defenses, arguably the two best in the league.\n\nIt would be tremendous for Peyton to win it and that defense at Denver is unbelievable, but with Cam Newton being able to extend plays, I think Carolina is going to win the game.\n\nI like Carolina's offensive line and their running game. And on defense, Luke Kuechly is the best linebacker in the game. They have a total team effort, but I think it will be a close game.\n\nI think Denver will have to run the ball to give the Broncos a shot to win, but I haven't seen a team as hot as Carolina in a while.\n\nStill, it will come down to quarterback play and whichever quarterback plays the best. Both of the defenses are really stout. Carolina's linebackers are so good and a lot will depend too if Thomas Davis is able to play. But, you would think if Denver's defense can rattle Tom Brady, they can rattle Cam Newton too.\n\nI don't think Cam Newton has seen anything like Von Miller and Demarcus Ware coming off the edges. Chris Harris Jr. at nickel back is one of the best in the league.\n\nI know the Panthers' defense gets a lot of credit, but Denver's defense is not too shabby. Peyton is just an intelligent man and I think he will be as prepared as any game he's ever played. I think he will lead them to the win on a final drive.\n\nAs a longtime favorite, you've got to pull for Peyton Manning. But, the Panthers have had a phenomenal season and they have a lot of momentum.\n\nEvery game but one, they've played lights out. The Carolina Panthers, with the way Cam Newton has developed, and with the offense, defense and special teams, I think they're a better team. With all Peyton has done for the National Football League, you pull for him to go out a winner. He's had two weeks to prepare so you think he will be ready to go. Super Bowl 50, I think will be a great game, one to remember.\n\nMy heart tells me the Broncos since Peyton said it might be his last rodeo, but I think Carolina is going to win it.\n\nCarolina looks like the team to beat all year. Offensively, they put up numbers really quick and Cam Newton is hard to stop as a dual-threat guy.\n\nDefensively, they're solid from the front to the back. Kuechly is the best linebacker out there and their backs break on the ball pretty good, but Denver's defense is pretty special too.\n\nI think Manning will play superbly. Knowledge is the key and he's been in so many big games like that. He's a Tennessee boy so I've got to pull for him.\n\nThe athleticism of both teams' defense is unreal, so different that what we can do at our level. You're amazed at the athleticism of the players.\n\nI think karma is on Peyton's side and they will get the win.\n\nIt will be tough to get points against the Carolina defense, but I think he will find a way to get it done.\n\nI'm disappointed my Patriots didn't get it in. My heart, I hope that Peyton goes out a winner, but Carolina looks like the best team in football right now.\n\nCarolina, they're young and they play good defense. I know a running quarterback usually gives Denver problems and the way Carolina scores so quickly and the way they've been blowing teams out, I've got to go with the Panthers.",

Denver ranked fourth overall in the NFL this season in points allowed (18.5 per game). Carolina led the NFL with an average of 31.2 points per game and has dropped 80 in the playoffs on Seattle and Arizona, two of the most productive defenses this year.\n\n>> The Broncos generated pressure on opposing QBs in 35 percent of defensive snaps, highest in the NFL\n\n>> Making this stat even more interesting, the Broncos blitzed a season-low 17.2 percent of snaps against the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, according to Pro Football Focus, showing just how dominant their front four was. If linebackers Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware can keep up that pace, Carolina's league-leading scoring offense could be in trouble.\n\n>> Denver went 11-3 this season in games decided by seven points or fewer, with the most close victories of any team in league history\n\n>> If the Super Bowl is tight and within one score, it bodes well for the Broncos.\n\n>> Manning will have four Super Bowl appearances with four different head coaches\n\n>> In his previous three Super Bowls, Manning has completed 90 of 132 passes (68.2 percent), which is second-best in NFL history for quarterbacks who have played in more than one Super Bowl.\n\n>> The only time Newton has played the Broncos (and Manning), Denver won 36-14\n\n>> The game came in 2012. The Broncos sacked Newton seven times, one of which was for a safety. Manning completed 71.1 percent of his passes for 301 yards and one touchdown that day. Newton threw for 241 yards with two scores but was picked off twice.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1SSmjEE",

Another noteworthy stat: His 10 rushing touchdowns in the regular season was just one shy of the NFL's leaders: running backs Adrian Peterson, Devonta Freeman, Jeremy Hill and DeAngelo Williams.\n\n>> The Panthers offensive line allowed Newton to get hit only 61 times this season, the third-lowest total in the NFL.\n\n>> By comparison, the Broncos racked up 17 quarterback hits on New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in last week's AFC Championship Game alone. In two playoff games, Newton has been hit only three times.\n\n>> The Panthers' point differential by halves: +162 in the first; +61 in the second.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\n\nSuper Bowl: 10 things to know about the Broncos\n\n>> A complete blowout against the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game helped, but Carolina's one big flaw is that it has allowed teams to get back in games in the second half after building big leads. All things considered, that's a good problem to have, but against a stingy Broncos defense, an early lead might be tougher to come by.\n\n>> The Panthers have rushed for at least 100 yards in 31 consecutive games, including four postseason contests over this span.\n\n>> If you remove a tie and a six-game losing streak that started this stretch -- a period when the team's young players began to take on larger roles \u00e2\u20ac\" Carolina's record in that span is 22-2. Denver's defense, however, only allowed seven 100-yard rushing games all season long.\n\n>> Ron Rivera previously faced Peyton Manning in a Super Bowl and lost.\n\n>> Rivera, now the head coach of the Panthers, was the defensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI, which the Indianapolis Colts and Manning won 29-17.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1WVVtL6",

                    "body": "Here's an old saying: \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\"\n\nThe Broncos are headed to their second Super Bowl in three years and are determined to avoid the mistakes they made the last time.\n\nFrom changing hotels midweek and being ill prepared for the weather and the crowd noise, Super Bowl XLVIII was largely a trip to forget for the Broncos.\n\nThe result on the field was a team that appeared unprepared from literally the first snap and lost 43-8 to Seattle.\n\nThe Broncos believe this time they are more mature, more aware and more apt to be at full focus at Sunday's kickoff.\n\n\"We've been through the week before,\" outside linebacker Von Miller said. \"It's all about the moment now. It's not about the gifts or where we're staying at or anything like that.\"\n\nNow, there's a new boss in town. Coach Gary Kubiak has Super Bowl experience and decided it's best to leave the week's off-field structure to the team's predominant leaders: quarterback Peyton Manning and outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware.\n\nThe first task for the captains was to set curfew. Manning suggested 9 p.m., much to the dismay of the rest of the team. Ware said he would take some time to think about it, hopeful of finding a middle ground.\n\nThe consensus throughout the team is that they won't let off-field distractions affect what for many is the biggest game of their career.\n\n\"I look back at my opportunities to go and I could almost go through each one of them and say, 'I wouldn't do that again,' or 'I would do that again,' \" Kubiak said. \"Every one is different. This one will be different.\"\n\nThe first big change Kubiak made was to have all of the Broncos players, including those on injured reserve, leave with the team for Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"That's what you want. Nobody is left behind, and everybody is going to be there together,\" cornerback Chris Harris said.\n\nDuring Super Bowl XLVIII, coach John Fox had Miller, Harris, defensive end Derek Wolfe and all of the other Broncos' injured players stay in Denver until Thursday of Super Bowl week.\n\nHarris and Miller were upset. They had been key contributors on the team but weren't awarded the opportunity to share in the experience.\n\nManning still has Super Bowl XLVIII in the front of his mind. He told Kubiak about the need to practice with noise, a reminder of the botched snap on the first play of the Super Bowl two years ago that resulted in a safety.\n\nTemperatures are expected to be in the 60s all week, so weather shouldn't be a problem like the cold of New York.\n\nWith the whole team in the San Francisco Bay area for the week, there are natural fears of night life and extracurricular activities. When Super Bowl week makes nearly every player a celebrity, how do you keep the balance?\n\n\"Everybody that has no affiliation with blue and orange, you don't have to listen to them,\" running back C.J. Anderson said.\n\nCornerback Aqib Talib didn't think it would be a problem.\n\n\"When it's time to chill, we chill,\" he said. \"When it's time to work, we definitely put in our work.\"\n\nKubiak trusts that his players won't do anything to sabotage the team's ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nEven in this environment, Santa Clara is a business trip.\n\nOne of the Broncos' elder statesmen is sure to keep the team in line if they slip up.\n\n\"If you see somebody that sits beside me today, their eyes are 'corralling' a little bit, that's when you slap him and he looks at you and he's like: 'OK. I've got to get back in order,' \" Ware said. \"So it's a fun time and they know that you really mean business, but it comes with trust.\"\n\nMany Broncos saw Super Bowl XLVIII hopes quickly go up in flames. Now 15 players who were on the 53-man roster then and now get a second shot at being a champion:\n\nNote: Outside linebacker Von Miller, cornerback Chris Harris, defensive end Derek Wolfe and outside linebacker Lerentee McCray were on injured reserve for Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\nSafeties David Bruton and Omar Bolden played inSuper Bowl XLVIII but will be on injured reserve for Super Bowl 50.",

Ramirez snapped the ball over Manning's head and the resulting safety helped set the tone in a 43-8 loss to the Seahawks.\n\nTwo years later, boisterous Seattle fans won't be at Levi's Stadium, but Manning isn't taking any chances. Last week, the Broncos practiced with piped-in noise at their facility. They didn't two years ago because then-head coach John Fox assumed a neutral crowd wouldn't be too loud.\n\n\"Peyton mentioned that (noise was an issue in Super Bowl XLVIII) so we took the approach this week to practice with noise,\" head coach Gary Kubiak said to reporters Saturday. \"We can always go the other way.\"\n\nEasy week: The Broncos' practices at Stanford this week won't be too arduous. Kubiak indicated their on-field sessions would be curtailed leading up to Super Bowl 50.\n\n\"We'll stay in our routine, but we'll probably be a lot shorter,\" Kubiak said. \"... Hopefully, we're short and very sharp ... I want them relaxed. They've done the work. They've put in the work, so I want them to relax next week and enjoy themselves so they're ready to go.\"\n\nThis and that: Broncos quarterbacks coach Greg Knapp coached Panthers quarterbacks coach Ken Dorsey with the 49ers in 2003. Knapp was the offensive coordinator and Dorsey, who attended Miramonte High-Orinda, was a backup quarterback. ... With a win, Manning would become the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl with multiple teams. ... Kubiak and Carolina's Ron Rivera are just the sixth and seventh head coaches to also appear in a Super Bowl as a player. They have joined a group that includes Forrest Gregg, Mike Ditka, Dan Reeves, Sam Wyche and Tony Dungy.",

We going to have today, maybe, to have a little fun but it's a business trip. It's not no vacation. We're ready to work to get the job done.\"\n\nThe Panthers and Broncos both largely put their game-plans together in practice back home, leaving just some fine tuning ahead of the big game.\n\nDenver, playing in their record-tying eighth Super Bowl game, are going for their third Lombardi Trophy.\n\nCarolina are aiming for their first championship in their second appearance in the Super Bowl.",

                    "body": "Uniformity. White uniforms in the big one? Any certified Broncomaniac knows we should be wearing take-no-prisoners orange. How can you have an Orange Crush defense wearing wimpy white? How can we be \"United in Orange\" if we're not in orange? Stick with the big orange in the big one. It's what got us here.\n\nChuck, Golden\n\nKiz: Orange is a groovy color. But the four times Denver has worn orange in the Super Bowl, the Broncos' record is 0-4, with those losses by an average score of 42-9. Not to suggest the Broncos are superstitious, but if you believe they should avoid the mistakes of their most recent trip to the Super Bowl, we can understand why Peyton Manning will take the field wearing white and will take the first snap from under center (so the football can't go flying over his head).\n\nMoney talks. I am a Broncos season-ticket holder with a priority number lower than 1,000. I returned home from Denver's victory in the AFC championship game only to find an e-mail from the Broncos telling me I was not selected in the lottery for Super Bowl tickets but could go to their partner Prime Sports and purchase a package at a cost of more than $4,000. I think it is outrageous the Broncos spit on their season-ticket holders and try to tell us it's raining.\n\nDoug, representing the 303\n\nKiz: Here's one of the packages promoted by the Broncos: one game ticket, one round-trip airfare to Oakland, arriving and departing Sunday, one tailgate party with food, drinks and music. Cost? $5,595. Don't know what you call it. But I call it a rip-off.\n\nBad coaching. After watching the Broncos beat New England, I thought John Fox was still coaching Denver. How come nobody is calling out Gary Kubiak for basically trying to give the game to the Patriots? What kind of coach has a 20-12 lead with a chance to go to the Super Bowl and refuses to go get even a field goal to seal the game? He wasn't even trying to get one first down. His coaching job was one of the worst in playoff history.\n\nLars, Chicago\n\nKiz: Props to the Denver defense, which repeatedly thwarted the comeback efforts from Pats quarterback Tom Brady. If the Broncos employ the same fourth-quarter strategy against Carolina quarterback Cam Newton, however, the odds are he will find the end zone for the points required to beat Denver.",

                    "body": "How else would Peyton Manning's team kick off Super Bowl week than with a little chicken parm?\n\nManning, the Broncos quarterback with a plethora of endorsements, is perhaps most known in commercials for singing the Nationwide jingle in which he doodles, \"Chicken Parm You Taste So Good.\"\n\nBefore Manning's team took off for San Francisco on Sunday, it looks like they got to enjoy that taste themselves.\n\n@BroncosguySochi, who appears to be Mike Bonner, the Broncos' senior director of event presentation and production, tweeted a picture of the team's menu on their flight to San Francisco, which featured a chicken parmesan sandwich as the pre-departure snack.\n\nThe Broncos, of course, are now in San Francisco for the start of Super Bowl week in anticipation of the team's showdown with the Panthers next Sunday for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nVideos posted by the Broncos' official Twitter account showed that fans showed up to the team's facility in Englewood, Co. The Broncos' faithful cheered and chanted as players boarded buses set for the airport to bring the team to the Super Bowl.\n\nPeyton Manning, the veteran quarterback hoping to pick up another ring in the twilight of his career, sported a crisp blue suit with an orange tie -- Broncos colors -- in photos before the team's takeoff.\n\nGood eats on this flight pic.twitter.com/eDogLIBjf8 -- Michael Bonner (@BroncosguySochi)\n\nJanuary 31, 2016\n\nManning also spoke in taped interview on ESPN at halftime of the Pro Bowl on Sunday night. The 39-year old quarterback said in that interview that he thought that the two week break between the championship games and the Super Bowl would help anyone, but noted he might benefit more than others.\n\n\"For any player, especially a player 30 years old and up, having a week off...it's definitely going to help you,\" Manning, who battled a plantar fascia injury earlier this season, said.\n\nThe Broncos landed in the Bay Area around 3 p.m. local time. Shorty thereafter, their opponents, the favored Carolina Panthers, also made it to California.\n\n\"Their entire football team is outstanding... Cam Newton is the MVP of the league,\" Manning said. \"He's had an outstanding year. So you have to realize how explosive their offense it. Oh by the way, their defense is one of the tops in the NFL.\"\n\nFor many Denver players, this is a familiar experience. Denver is playing in the Super Bowl for the second time in three seasons, but they are hoping for a different result this time around. The Broncos were blown out by the Seahawks 43-8 in Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium in February 2014.",

                    "body": "Here's an old saying: \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\"\n\nThe Broncos are headed to their second Super Bowl in three years and are determined to avoid the mistakes they made the last time.\n\nFrom changing hotels midweek and being ill prepared for the weather and the crowd noise, Super Bowl XLVIII was largely a trip to forget for the Broncos.\n\nThe result on the field was a team that appeared unprepared from literally the first snap and lost 43-8 to Seattle.\n\nThe Broncos believe this time they are more mature, more aware and more apt to be at full focus at Sunday's kickoff.\n\n\"We've been through the week before,\" outside linebacker Von Miller said. \"It's all about the moment now. It's not about the gifts or where we're staying at or anything like that.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Fans celebrated the Denver Broncos heading to Super Bowl 50\n\nNow, there's a new boss in town. Coach Gary Kubiak has Super Bowl experience and decided it's best to leave the week's off-field structure to the team's predominant leaders: quarterback Peyton Manning and outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware.\n\nThe first task for the captains was to set curfew. Manning suggested 9 p.m., much to the dismay of the rest of the team. Ware said he would take some time to think about it, hopeful of finding a middle ground.\n\nThe consensus throughout the team is that they won't let off-field distractions affect what for many is the biggest game of their career.\n\n\"I look back at my opportunities to go and I could almost go through each one of them and say, 'I wouldn't do that again,' or 'I would do that again,' \" Kubiak said. \"Every one is different. This one will be different.\"\n\nThe first big change Kubiak made was to have all of the Broncos players, including those on injured reserve, leave with the team for Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"That's what you want. Nobody is left behind, and everybody is going to be there together,\" cornerback Chris Harris said.\n\nDuring Super Bowl XLVIII, coach John Fox had Miller, Harris, defensive end Derek Wolfe and all of the other Broncos' injured players stay in Denver until Thursday of Super Bowl week.\n\nHarris and Miller were upset. They had been key contributors on the team but weren't awarded the opportunity to share in the experience.\n\nManning still has Super Bowl XLVIII in the front of his mind. He told Kubiak about the need to practice with noise, a reminder of the botched snap on the first play of the Super Bowl two years ago that resulted in a safety.\n\nTemperatures are expected to be in the 60s all week, so weather shouldn't be a problem like the cold of New York.\n\nWith the whole team in the San Francisco Bay area for the week, there are natural fears of night life and extracurricular activities. When Super Bowl week makes nearly every player a celebrity, how do you keep the balance?\n\n\"Everybody that has no affiliation with blue and orange, you don't have to listen to them,\" running back C.J. Anderson said.\n\nCornerback Aqib Talib didn't think it would be a problem.\n\n\"When it's time to chill, we chill,\" he said. \"When it's time to work, we definitely put in our work.\"\n\nKubiak trusts that his players won't do anything to sabotage the team's ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nEven in this environment, Santa Clara is a business trip.\n\nOne of the Broncos' elder statesmen is sure to keep the team in line if they slip up.\n\n\"If you see somebody that sits beside me today, their eyes are 'corralling' a little bit, that's when you slap him and he looks at you and he's like: 'OK. I've got to get back in order,' \" Ware said. \"So it's a fun time and they know that you really mean business, but it comes with trust.\"",

                    "body": "Not even football could set up the situation more ideally, and this is a sport that begins each game with the ball balanced perfectly on a tee.\n\nThe aging, legendary future Hall of Fame quarterback clinging to the final remnants of past glory trying to will his team to victory against the forces of unbridled youth in the golden anniversary edition of the ultimate championship game.\n\nOther than that, Super Bowl 50 really doesn't offer a whole lot.\n\nIf you have a heart -- and, perhaps, the early onset of angina -- you're pulling for Peyton Manning against Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers. Everyone 40 and older is rooting for him, at least according to what I just read on the Twitter.\n\nI suspect even Bill Belichick is on Manning's side and everyone knows Belichick, where his heart should be, has only a cold, jagged stone.\n\nYes, if you remember when a hashtag was called a number sign, you'd love to see Manning's Denver Broncos win because there's nothing more poignant than a man riding off into forever as a champion.\n\nIn fact, these two teams, on the surface, offer such a polarizing generational juxtaposition, that the Broncos should change their name, just for this one matchup, to the Denver Pyles.\n\nDon't worry. If you're unfamiliar with that reference, it's OK. You're rooting for Newton and the Panthers anyway.\n\nIt's really not this simple, of course, not this black and white, with a touch of gray around the temples.\n\nThe Panthers' roster includes 12-year veteran Jared Allen, an old-guard five-time Pro Bowl defensive end who, before this season, had experienced just a single playoff victory.\n\nThe Broncos' success, as much as on the passing of Manning, could depend on the running of C.J. Anderson, who, during Manning's rookie season, was only 7 years old.\n\nBut it's much easier and more entertaining to analyze this game in overly simplistic terms, bearing in mind that, if Manning does win, his hamstrings will appear next on \"Antiques Roadshow.\"\n\nSee, Manning is the beloved, dorky everyman who celebrates touchdowns by modestly pumping his fist and then, during the commercial breaks, tries to sell us stuff by being delightfully awkward and convincingly vulnerable.\n\nNewton, in comparison, is the flashy personality who celebrates first downs by pumping his entire body and then, during the commercial breaks, tries to sell us stuff by wearing a cape and playing the part of a superhero.\n\nHow's that for being overly simplistic? For conveniently ignoring the fact Newton, through his various physical expressions, actually appears to be having fun playing a game that was invented for fun in the first place?\n\nYou better believe it's easier to make this Super Bowl about those who grew up thinking a quarterback looks like Johnny Unitas against those who nowadays think a quarterback looks like Johnny Manziel.\n\nBut let's all be honest for a moment. Who doesn't want to see a decorated all-time great go on top? This is particularly true when given the opportunity to witness the complete opposite, although, frankly, I've already written plenty this season about Kobe Bryant and the Lakers.\n\nRemember Jerome Bettis? He retired after his Pittsburgh Steelers won the Super Bowl and in his hometown of Detroit, no less.\n\nBasketball's Bill Russell retired after winning his 11th NBA title, his final appearance coming in Game 7 against the Lakers in Los Angeles, and how Hollywood is that?\n\nJohn Elway retired after winning consecutive Super Bowls -- he even was named MVP of the second one -- and he's the man now running the Broncos.\n\nMichael Jordan was so ultra-competitive, so committed to experiencing that lasting and permanent moment of euphoria that he retired after winning the NBA championship -- twice, in 1993 and again in 1998.\n\nJordan, naturally, also retired as a failed minor league baseball player and, even worse, a failed Washington Wizard.\n\nBut this column is about going out on top, remember, not about going out on the bottom more than the rubbery portion of a pair of Air Jordans.\n\nAlthough there has been no official acknowledgment, the prevailing theory is that this will be Manning's final game, particularly if the Broncos win.\n\nAfter the AFC championship, Manning apparently whispered something to Belichick about a \"last rodeo,\" and I'm just glad I didn't have to come up with all the old man cliches for this column.\n\nOne last rodeo for the aging cowboy? To be honest, watching Manning struggle physically at times this season, I'm afraid his story ultimately is probably too true to be good.\n\nI'm thinking the Panthers are going to win Super Bowl 50, are going to spoil our perfect ending, that a set up this ideal can't possibly happen, right?\n\nThen again, the aging cowboy is the one with a horse on his helmet, and horses are the preferred mode of transportation when riding off into a sinking sun.\n\nVisit The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.) at www.ocregister.com",

                    "title": "Anatomy Of Loss: Studying Carolina's Offense",
                    "body": "The Carolina Panthers have lost just one game this season -- a 20-13 road loss in Atlanta. Join MHH Publisher Chad Jensen as he studies Cam Newton and some of the Panthers' offensive staples.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers are one of the most balanced offensive teams in the NFL. During the regular season, they rushed the ball 51.22 percent of the time -- good for second-highest in the league.\n\nCarolina's offensive approach revolves around a few cornerstone principles. Firstly, tempo. Cam Newton and the Panthers offense want to move from play to play quickly and dictate the tempo of the game. They want to be the aggressors.\n\nCarolina wants to impose their will on the opposition and they start with tempo and a wide variety of rushing attacks. Single-back sets. Shotgun. Pistol. Motions. Read-option. Triple-option. Quarterback designed runs.\n\nThey've been wildly successful with it because the opposing defense has to account for more than just the running back. Newton is always a threat to run and offensive coordinator Mike Shula finds ways to get the receivers involved, even if it's just as decoys.\n\nThe Panthers want to pick up large chunks of yardage on first and second down running the ball. Once they've got the defense in a lull, zeroed in on the running game, that's when the play-action comes into the equation. That's when WR Ted Ginn, Jr. and TE Greg Olsen get involved.\n\nWhen the Atlanta Falcons handed Carolina their only loss in Week 16, they succeeded by consistently pressuring Cam Newton and they took away Ginn and the big play downfield. Olsen was largely kept in check. The Falcons couldn't stop the run -- they allowed 155 yards on the ground.\n\nBut Atlanta didn't allow the big play downfield and they stayed disciplined on play-action. Newton's deepest completion was for just 15 yards. Let's take a look at some of Carolina's plays from that game that can give us an insight into what the Broncos can expect in Super Bowl 50.\n\nPlay No. 1:\n\nMike Shula loves designed Cam Newton running plays in the redzone and this play is quintessential. Atlanta rushes four and there are a lot of open lanes for Newton to navigate. Notice All-Pro center Ryan Kalil way downfield, into the secondary, paving the way for Newton's 8-yard score.\n\nDenver will have to account for this attack inside the 20. It'll be important for defenders -- linebackers and defensive backs -- not to turn their back on the line of scrimmage. Newton thrives on that. And put a spy on the QB in the redzone.\n\nPlay No. 2:\n\nOn this play we see Newton in the shotgun, looking to make a play downfield with his arm. Atlanta has it covered well and the pocket is collapsing. This play captures Newton's size, power and will to win. We see him step out of a couple of leg tackles and then push the pile and stretch the ball across the first-down marker.\n\nHe gets help in the pile by his big O-linemen, helping to push him forward to convert the first down. Carolina plays fast and as talented as their offesive line is, they're also remarkbly smart. Their situational awareness is something that helps the Panthers in more ways than one.\n\nThis is a play where clearly one side wanted it more than the other. That's intensity. And physicality. The Broncos will have to eclipse this level of focus in Super Bowl 50. And when Newton gets in the open field, the Broncos have to not only tackle him well, but make him pay for it.\n\nPlay No. 3:\n\nShula's innovation continues. Remember we were talking about the receivers getting involved? WR Jerricho Cotchery goes in motion from right to left, ending as the deep back in a pistol formation. Newton has three choices on this play -- hence the triple option moniker.\n\nHe can give it to his running back. Keep it, or toss it to Cotchery. But Newton has to read the defensive end. If the DE crashes toward the RB, Newton eliminates one option, which is what happens here. Instead of keeping the ball, he tosses it to Cotchery, who has a full head of steam and a step to the edge.\n\nThis play picks up 16 yards and spotlights what I meant by the defense having to account for more than just the RB in the running game. The Broncos interior linemen and inside linebackers will have to play well between the tackles and allow the outside linebackers -- DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller -- to maintain discipine on the edge and force Newton to hand the ball off up the gut.\n\nPlay No. 4:\n\nMore option looks. RB Cameron Artis-Payne motions to the deep back in the pistol set. TE Ed Dickson is to Newton's left as the fullback and RB/FB Mike Tolbert is to his right. Although this looks like a designed give to Tolbert, it is a zone read.\n\nNewton keeps his eye on the outside DE and when he doesn't bite inside on Tolbert, Newton gives it to his RB. This play is blocked well. TE Dickson gets a great block and Tolbert picks up six yards. Again, the Broncos will have to maintain their discipline and guys like Malik Jackson, Sylvester Williams and Derek Wolfe will have to dominate the point of attack inside.\n\nPlay No. 5:\n\nHere we see how dangerous Newton can be when he gets a head of steam. Carolina catches Atlanta sleeping on a substitution and makes the most out of a free play. It is a designed QB run left. Carolina makes a show of the deep back in the pistol going right, while the play goes left.\n\nBut Newton just puts his head down and follows his blockers. Desmond Trufant (No. 23) of Atlanta makes the mistake of trying to tackle Newton high. Like Rob Gronkowski, when Cam Newton is in the open field, the best way to take him down is to hit him low. Get him around the legs and be sure to wrap up because he's strong. This play goes for 18 yards.\n\nPlay No. 6:\n\nMore motion and eye-trickery. Follow the bouncing ball. Newton's in the shotgun, with RB Tolbert to his left. WR Philly Brown goes in motion from right to left, in hopes of drawing a tail and getting Atlanta to over-commit. But it's another designed run to Newton -- in the redzone.\n\nDE Vic Beasley does a great job setting the edge, forcing Newton inside where he's bottled up by the defense. This play was perfectly defended by the Falcons and reiterates why it's important for ends and OLBs to maintain lane and assignment discipline against Carolina.\n\nPlay No. 7:\n\nI chose to show this play because it's an example of Shula's creativity and commitment to get TE Greg Olsen the ball. Here, Newton drops back out of the shotgun and makes an easy completion to Olsen. He has a couple of options but notice the deep streaker out of the slot, who clears out the middle of the field.\n\nOlsen makes like he's staying in to pass block, but sheds his man and sneaks out into the passing lane. The play doesn't quite pick Carolina up the first down, but again, it gets the defense thinking. Olsen is Newton's security blanket and the Broncos will have to figure out how to take him away next Sunday.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Denver Broncos can learn a lot from this game. Cam Newton is a different quarterback when he's under pressure. I didn't choose to show many passing plays, because stopping Carolina starts and ends with the run. Their entire passing scheme is dependent on the run.\n\nWade Phillips found a way to pressure Tom Brady constantly in the AFC title game, while only blitzing on about 17 percent of the snaps. That means the Broncos were successful rushing the passer primarily with three or four guys.\n\nNow, Carolina's offensive line is significantly better than New England's piece-meal unit was. But that doesn't mean the Broncos can't overcome it and get to Newton. But first thing's first. Stop the run and get Carolina into third-and-long situations where the play-action is nullified.\n\nForce Newton to stay in the pocket and make his reads downfield, all while applying pressure. It's easier said than done. But if the Broncos hope to emerge next Sunday with their third Lombardi Trophy, they'll have to get it done.\n\nWhat say you? Can the Broncos stop the Panthers offense?

                    "body": "Bob Glauber\n\nGlauber has been Newsday's national football columnist since 1992. He was Newsday's football writer covering the Jets and\n\nemail twitter HIGHLIGHTS Two-time Super Bowl champ as QB has transitioned nicely to front officeShrewd drafting, free-agent and coaching moves by Hall of Fame passer\n\nJohn Elway was one of the NFL's greatest quarterbacks, a Hall of Fame passer with five Super Bowl appearances and two championship runs to end his career with the Broncos.\n\nBut as terrific as his skills were as a legendary quarterback whose epic comeback drives are part of NFL lore, his personnel skills make him one of the league's premier architects of a championship caliber roster.\n\nFor as much as Super Bowl 50 is about what could be Peyton Manning's final chance to leave the game as Elway did -- with a Vince Lombardi Trophy in hand -- it is about the spectacular job Elway has done in constructing a team capable of winning it all.\n\nLatest columns Glauber: Panthers' SB berth started with ex-GM Hurney Glauber: Newton, Panthers pass SB 50 eye test Glauber: Newton has nothing to apologize about Glauber: Eli knows SB50 won't decide Peyton's legacy Glauber: Storybook finish for Peyton Manning?\n\nAs general manager and vice president of football operations, Elway's moves in recent years have set the stage for the team's second Super Bowl appearance in the last three years. His impact is as tangible and meaningful as any of his achievements during his 16-year career as the Broncos' quarterback.\n\nStart with Manning himself. When the former Colts quarterback was shopping for a new team after he was released by the Colts in 2012, the Broncos were completely under the radar as a potential suitor. But through Elway's stealth recruiting, which included some persuasive conversations with Manning that only a former quarterback with Elway's background could pull off, Manning became convinced that Denver would be his best landing spot.\n\nThis after the Broncos seemed stuck with Tim Tebow, who had led a dramatic playoff run the previous year. About the only person in Denver who seemed unconvinced about Tebow's place on the team was Elway himself. Who can forget the sight of Elway's dour expression when Tebow led the Broncos to a stunning overtime playoff win against the Steelers with an 80-yard touchdown pass in the extra session? He may have been happy about the win, but Elway knew he couldn't get to a Super Bowl with Tebow, who was summarily traded to the Jets soon after Elway landed Manning.\n\nBut it was more than just getting the right quarterback that set Elway apart as a shrewd general manager. His head coaching moves were also smart, from hiring John Fox in 2011 to provide a measure of discipline and stability, to believing the time was right to part ways with Fox after the 2014 season because of philosophical differences.\n\nElway brought in former Broncos teammate -- and roommate -- Gary Kubiak, a one-time backup quarterback who had a solid if unspectacular run as the Texans' head coach. But Kubiak proved to be a resourceful and effective leader in his second go-round as a head coach.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\n\"The bottom line is I know Gary and he knows what it takes and he has done a tremendous job this year with the team,\" Elway said. \"When he came in here, he had won a lot of football games and to be able to come in and get us back to the Super Bowl has been tremendous. There is not a better guy for the job.\"\n\nKubiak had the unenviable task of dealing with Manning's worst statistical season, which was compounded by a foot injury that forced him out of the lineup. The coach showed a patient hand with backup Brock Osweiler but also knew when it was time to go back to Manning in the regular-season finale against the Chargers.\n\nBut what helped the Broncos weather that storm was a championship caliber defense pulled together by Elway. He used a combination of terrific draft choices such as linebacker Von Miller and defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson -- and even signing college free agent Chris Harris Jr., who has turned into one of the NFL's top cornerbacks -- and then made judicious moves in free agency to further increase the talent pool. Among the key signings: Cowboys linebacker DeMarcus Ware, Patriots cornerback Aqib Talib, Browns safety T.J. Ward and 49ers inside linebacker Brandon Marshall.\n\nThat defense was at the heart of the Broncos' 20-18 win over the Patriots for the AFC title, a game that wasn't decided until Denver prevented Tom Brady from completing a two-point conversion in the final seconds. The Broncos put on a pass- rushing clinic against the Patriots, sacking Brady four times and getting hits on him 20 times, the most Brady had absorbed all season.\n\n\"It's kind of how the year has gone,\" Elway said. \"I think our defense has made so many great plays throughout the whole year and really saved us. They did it again against a great team and a great quarterback in Tom Brady.\"\n\nAnd now the Broncos are once again in familiar territory for the former All-Pro quarterback. Elway lost his first three Super Bowls before winning the final two and then leaving the game after the 1998 season. He knows the job is not complete, that getting here is not what it's about.\n\n\"I think the big thing is we have to win it,\" he said. \"We've given ourselves an opportunity, so hopefully we've saved our best for last.\"",

From Centennial, the 24-year old has been a Broncos fan for as long as she can remember, she says.\n\nHer fondest Broncos memories are going to games with her father, a season ticket-holder, cheering in snow and cold and supporting the team through the not-so-great days.\n\n\"One year I was home from college for the Broncos vs. Patriots game when (Tim) Tebow was on his winning streak,\" DeGreef remembers. \"I looked up ticket prices online and my dad could easily have sold his tickets for 10 times face value. I told him I understood if he wanted to sell but he said, 'Of course not! I wouldn't miss that game with you for the world.' \"\n\nFast forward to 2016 and DeGreef is planning a Super Bowl party outside of Broncos Country for most of her D.C. friends who are not United in Orange.\n\n\"I had to find a way to convince them my Super Bowl party was going to be the best one, so I decided to write a poem for the Facebook event page,\" she said.\n\nThe poem turned into a 49-line ode to the Broncos and the week before the Super Bowl set to the tune of \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\" that she called \"'Twas the week before the Super Bowl\" and submitted to The Denver Post.\n\nDeGreef said it took about an hour to write the poem, then extra time afterward perfecting it. using the original story meter and rhymes as her guide, writing it came easily.\n\nSince sharing the poem on Facebook, friends have been coming out of the woodwork with a great response, which she says is especially meaningful for DeGreef living outside her home state of Colorado during all the Super Bowl excitement.\n\n\"It's easy to feel removed and detached from all the excitement and energy surrounding this game, so this has really connected me back to that and gotten me pumped for next Sunday,\" she said.\n\nAs for next Sunday? DeGreef is still not losing hope on trying to score herself seat at the big game. \"I'm sure my friends would understand if I had to cancel my Super Bowl party.\"\n\nWith apologies to Clement Clarke Moore (and Peyton Manning)\n\n'Twas the week before the Super Bowl, when all through the lands\n\nEveryone was nervously wringing their hands.\n\nThe Broncos were polishing their trophy case with care,\n\nIn hopes that another Vince Lombardi Trophy soon would be there.\n\nBroncos fans on the east coast all took to their sleds,\n\nWhile visions of touchdowns danced in their heads.\n\nThe Panthers in their black suits and Broncos in white,\n\nWere just gearing up for the afternoon fight.\n\nWhen out on the practice field Demaryius was catching,\n\nBut a team dressed in white and their orange football gear.\n\nWith a little old quarterback, so lively and cunning,\n\nAnd he whistled and shouted and called them by name:\n\nWhen it meets with a gust of wind, mounts to the skies;\n\nHe was dressed all in white, from his head to his toe,",

I think the other team looks fantastic. Probably, they would be favored by something,\" Trump said. \"But I'll stick with Peyton because he's a very good guy.\"\n\nThe Broncos defeated Trump's original favorite to win it all, the New England Patriots, last week in the AFC Championship game.\n\nThe billionaire businessman has not been shy in his praise of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.",

                    "body": "The chance to win a title is more than enough to motivate members of the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50, but offering a further financial incentive will only sweeten the pot for the winning team.\n\nGranted, everybody will be a bit richer after the Super Bowl, according to CBSSports.com's Chris Trapasso. The losers will take home $49,000 apiece, while the winners will be entitled to an individual share of up to $97,000.\n\nFor the teams' highest annual earners, neither payout will register much excitement. For those earning at or close to the league minimum, though, the winning share would equal a significant chunk of their salary this year.\n\nCBSSports.com's Joel Corry, a former sports agent, explained which players will be entitled to payouts at the close of the playoffs:\n\nPlayers on the 53-man roster when the game is played who have been on the roster for at least three previous games Players with more than one year of experience put on injured reserve during the regular season who are still under contract when the game is played Players with four or more years in the league put on injured reserve during the preseason who are still under contract when the game is played Players who aren't on the 53-man roster at game time who spent at least eight games on the roster provided they're not under contract to another team in the same conference\n\nOf course, no player stands to gain more financially than Peyton Manning. The Broncos quarterback restructured his contract in March, giving him the chance to earn back the $4 million he saved the team. As ESPN.com's Jeff Legwold wrote, Manning received half of that $4 million after leading Denver to an AFC championship; the other half will be paid out should the Broncos win the Super Bowl.\n\n\"I've never really talked about my contract and I'm not going to start now,\" said Manning.\n\nManning hasn't officially announced he plans on retiring after the Super Bowl, but he intimated as much to New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, per the NFL:\n\nTheir 20th career showdown?\n\nMight've been the last.\n\nSo Peyton met Belichick at midfield and... wow #NFLPlayoffs https://t.co/YvvkE6Wxyw -- NFL (@NFL)\n\nJanuary 26, 2016\n\nIt would be fitting for Manning's last act on an NFL field to be winning the Super Bowl, mirroring how the man who helped bring him to Denver -- Broncos general manager John Elway -- ended his NFL career.\n\nPocketing a further $2 million wouldn't be too bad for Manning, either.",

                    "body": "When the best of the best meet to determine which No. 1 seed receives the Lombardi Trophy, picking a favorite becomes a nearly impossible chore.\n\nWait, scratch that. According to Odds Shark, the Carolina Panthers are six-point favorites to best the Denver Broncos. The line opened at 3.5 and has risen all week, pointing to heavy action in the NFC champions' favor.\n\nThe Broncos were also underdogs last weekend despite hosting the New England Patriots, and their bullying defense should stop the spread from expanding any more. While repeating their AFC Championship Game performance would produce a thriller, many onlookers instead fear seeing a replica of Super Bowl XLVIII, when the physical Seattle Seahawks manhandled the overmatched Broncos.\n\nThe truth probably lies somewhere in between.\n\nSuper Bowl Info\n\nWhen: Sunday, Feb. 7\n\nTime: 6:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif.\n\n*Spread: Panthers -6\n\n*Over/Under: 45\n\n*Odds via Odds Shark as of Sunday, Jan. 31\n\nPreview\n\nChuck Burton/Associated Press\n\nBy most measures, the Panthers are simply a better team than the Broncos. A casual observer need look no further than the records, as Carolina has lost one game to Denver's four.\n\nThat simple approach, however, actually underscores the gap. After demolishing the Arizona Cardinals, who entered the playoffs with the second-best record and point differential, the Panthers boast a plus-228 scoring margin.\n\nDenver, which has attained 11 of its 14 victories by seven or fewer points, carries a plus-68 point differential. Even after two playoff triumphs, it has outscored opponents by fewer points than the New York Jets.\n\nShare Tweet Embed\n\nCarolina followed a similar win-close formula early in the season, but it has since proved far more dangerous. Following the 49-15 annihilation of Arizona, it sports a 32 percent Defensive Adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA), per Football Outsiders' Aaron Schatz. Denver wields a 20.1 percent clip, which rates No. 8 in the NFL.\n\nSchatz examined Carolina's rise from a misleading undefeated club to a perennial powerhouse:\n\nThe same Panthers team that had just one win by 14 or more points in its first eight games has six wins by 14 or more points in its last ten games, including four different wins by 28 or more points. Including the playoffs, there were only eight games this season with single-game DVOA over 100%. Carolina has three of those games, all of them in the second half of the season...\n\nIf it's any consolation to Denver, Vegas is on a Super Bowl slump. Per Odds Shark's Mike Pickett, the underdog has won each of the past four clashes. Since Peyton Manning led the favored Indianapolis Colts to a 29-17 win over the Chicago Bears nine years ago, only the Green Bay Packers have covered as favorites.\n\nOf course, the \"nobody believes in us\" narrative will surface from the jilted underdogs. The Patriots looked like a strong bet to make their second straight Super Bowl, but the league's top-rated defense instead pulverized Tom Brady all game.\n\nAfter pulling off the upset, Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. lambasted the media for making logical yet inaccurate predictions, per DenverBroncos.com's Andrew Mason:\n\nWe felt like we were totally disrespected by everybody in the media. I don't think I heard one telecast about us winning. And as good a defense as we've been playing all year, that was the focal point: that Tom Brady was going to shred us apart. So we took total disrespect [from] that. Total disrespect. So we wanted to prove a point to everybody.\n\nHe can beat the same drum for another week. In all fairness, the Broncos already hold seven victories over playoff participants. With a defense dominating every facet of the game, their penchant for winning close games could be considered a bankable skill rather than a harbinger of upcoming regression.\n\nYet it's also worth noting that everything needed to go according to plan for Denver to win a contest that was a two-point conversion away from overtime. It now has to decimate a superior Carolina offensive line while also worrying about Cam Newton's running prowess.\n\nIncluding the postseason, the Panthers have registered 32.2 points per game. Keeping them below 20 is asking a lot, but it also may prove necessary given Denver's offense.\n\nCarolina compiled a league-high 24 interceptions during the season before picking off Russell Wilson and Carson Palmer a combined six times in the playoffs. Despite missing six games, Peyton Manning's 17 interceptions nearly led the league.\n\nDuring the season, the Panthers limited the opposition to 6.2 yards per pass attempt, tied with Denver for first. Manning, meanwhile, isn't exactly spraying darts downfield. Pro Football Focus highlighted the discrepancy in deep accuracy between the starting quarterbacks:\n\nCam Newton has the 3rd-highest accuracy percentage on deep passes (20+ YIA) this season at 48.8%. Peyton Manning ranks 33rd of 35 at 27.5% -- Pro Football Focus (@PFF)\n\nJanuary 28, 2016\n\nWith apologies to Denver's defense, Carolina is the rightful favorite. While one unit has carried the Broncos this far, the Panthers harbor elite talent on both sides of the field. The Panthers have had trouble maintaining large leads in the past, but the Broncos aren't built to overcome an early deficit. If they fall behind early, they're toast.",

I know him,\" Trump said. \"And he's a very, very good guy.\"\n\nManning, who missed part of the season due to injury, won one Super Bowl, in 2007, when he played for the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n\"I have to go with the person I know and I like,\" Trump said. \"I like the other team. I think the other team looks fantastic. Probably, they would be favored by something. But I'll stick with Peyton because he's a very good guy.\"\n\nDespite his praise for Manning, Trump's \"greatest\" compliments have been for Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady, another quarterback he notes he knows personally.\n\n\"I know Tom. He is the greatest guy. He is the greatest person,\" Trump said on Boston's WRKO 680-AM in early January, when the Patriots were still in contention for the Super Bowl.\n\n\"He's better than everyone else,\" Trump said. \"You got yourselves a real gem, believe me.\"",

                    "body": "So the Broncos were able to squeak by the Patriots in the AFC Championship game last week. However, when they face the Panthers in the Superbowl they won't be so lucky.\n\nA lot of people were rooting for the Broncos last week, half for wanting Manning to make it to another Superbowl, and the other half just wanting the Patriots to lose. We get it, like 80% of all NFL fans hate the Patriots and want them to lose everything all the time. For all of those people that want Manning to win another Superbowl, sorry, it isn't going to happen.\n\n6 Reasons why you shouldn't watch the Pro Bowl\n\nIf you told me the Broncos, who got steamrolled against the Seahawks 2 years ago will win this game, I'd call you crazy. The Panthers are a better team than the Seahawks were and the Broncos are a worse team than they were when they got stomped. That explosive offense is gone, they still have no running game, and Manning will probably choke under the pressure of having to be perfect. Yes, the Broncos' defense is better than it was, but the Panthers' offense is better than the Seahawks' offense was and we saw how that went.\n\nThe Cardinals had an amazing defense too, they also had a better offense than the Broncos currently do and look how that ended; the Panthers forced like a dozen turnovers and completely railed the Cardinals so badly that they pulled their starters in a Championship game. That beat down was one of the worst I've seen in a while, well since the Patriots' AFC Championship game against the Colts last year, and the Broncos last Superbowl.\n\nEven if the Patriots would have come back on the Broncos, I would have a hard time being confident about them beating the Panthers. I think they would put up more of a fight than the Broncos, but I don't know if they'd be able to win. The Broncos are a fine team with good pieces, but the Panthers are on a whole different level.",

                    "body": "When it comes to having a compelling history of head-to-head matchups, the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos rank near the bottom of the NFL.\n\nWhile it is fairly noteworthy that current Chicago Bears head coach John Fox served in a similar position with both teams and led the Panthers and Broncos to losing Super Bowl efforts, the teams have little in common.\n\nThe Panthers and Broncos have four regular-season games in their history, and the Broncos hold a 3-1 advantage in the series. The Broncos won both games played in Denver, while the two teams have split a pair of games in Carolina.\n\nThe two teams last played during the 2012 season when the Broncos went to Bank of America Stadium and leveled a 36-14 victory on Ron Rivera's team.\n\nCam Newton and Peyton Manning were the two quarterbacks in that game, but Newton has become a much better and more consistent quarterback since then. Manning was in the midst of a brilliant first season in Denver, in which he completed 68.6 percent of his passes, threw for 4,659 yards and 37 touchdowns.\n\nShare Tweet Embed\n\nNewton was not the accomplished passer that he has become, but he still completed 21 of 36 passes for 241 yards with two TDs and two interceptions. Interestingly, the Broncos limited Newton to seven rushing yards on four carries.\n\nThe key to the outcome in that game was an overwhelming Denver pass rush. The Broncos defense sacked Newton seven times in that game as former Denver DT Kevin Vickerson led the way with 2.0 sacks. Vickerson has not played in the NFL since 2014.\n\nWhile much has changed between the two teams since that game, a strong Denver pass rush may be the key to the Broncos earning another win in this game.\n\nNewton has become a much more accomplished player and has an excellent chance of coming away with the MVP award for his play in the regular season. Newton threw 35 TD passes during the regular season and he added 10 more on the ground.\n\nHis versatility as a runner and a passer has always been his signature, but his ability to come through with big plays on a consistent basis is the reason he has improved so much. The numbers don't tell the full story behind this year's success. He completed 296 of 496 passes for 3,837 yards this year, and those numbers are somewhat similar to what he has done in previous seasons.\n\nHowever, his 35-10 TD-interception ratio is dramatically better, and so is his 7.1 TD pass percentage. He had never thrown more than 24 TD passes in any season and 5.1 percent had been his best previous TD percentage mark.\n\nKevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\n\nManning's numbers have dipped sharply downward since the end of the 2013 season. That was the year he had a 55-10 TD-interception percentage, and that figure slipped to 7-19 this year. However, the downturn has given the Broncos a new road map to follow when it comes to winning games.\n\nHead coach Gary Kubiak and Manning realize that he no longer has the arm strength at this point to throw the ball successfully all over the field. The Broncos need a successful running game and a dominant defense to have a chance against an explosive team like the Panthers.\n\nThe Broncos did not get much from their running game in the AFC title game against New England (3.3 yards per carry), but they were so good defensively that they were able to come through on their homefield.\n\nThey will need C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman to come through on the ground if they want to keep Newton off the field.\n\nIn addition to the quarterback, running back Jonathan Stewart (989 yards) has the power and nastiness to cause problems with the running game, while tight end Greg Olsen (77 receptions for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns) and wide out Ted Ginn Jr. (10 TD receptions) are both impact players.\n\nThe Panthers are six-point favorites with one week to go before kickoff, according to Odds Shark. The line increased steadily through Thursday and appears to have leveled off at this point.\n\nPrediction\n\nThe Broncos were home underdogs in the AFC title game, but the defense held Tom Brady and the Patriots in check with its relentlessness and pass-rush ability.\n\nThey will need to be at least as good against the Panthers, who were 15-1 in the regular season and have been even more impressive in two postseason wins over Seattle and Arizona.\n\nThe Panthers are clear favorites in this game, and they will feel plenty of pressure in that role. That could help the Broncos a bit.\n\nHowever, the Carolina offense has made big plays all season, and the Panthers have shown the ability to get off to fast starts in the postseason. If they can do that against the Broncos, they have the power to put this game away early.\n\nLook for the Carolina defense to control the Denver running game and harass Manning. The Panthers should open a double-digit lead by halftime, and they should dominate the game throughout the second half.\n\nFinal score: Carolina 33, Denver 14",

                    "title": "Sundays with Sacco: A family affair",
                    "body": "The family roots in the Broncos from the coaching staff to the rest of the organization run deep as the team heads to Super Bowl 50.\n\nThe Denver Broncos head to Santa Clara Sunday with a great sense of family.\n\nEvery team says that, and I would never disparage the emotions of any other organization, but not many have the tight bond that we all share in Denver.\n\nThe reason everyone in Denver feels that way is because it really is so.\n\nJohn Elway, the Broncos' Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager, is the first man to ever go into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a 16-year quarterback with just one organization, then come back to be the general manager of that same team and take it to the Super Bowl.\n\nAnd beyond that, Head Coach Gary Kubiak is the only head coach in Super Bowl history to go to the game as both player and head coach of the same team.\n\nWe could even take that to another level of factoid craziness by saying he is the only head coach to go to the Super Bowl with the same team as quarterback, offensive coordinator and head coach.\n\nWhen John and Gary (I know that journalistic style demands that I refer to them by their last names, but really, I have known and worked with both for 34 years, and my \"family sense\" make them John and Gary to me) put together their coaching staff, it was all about coaching ability but felt so much like family first.\n\nWhen Gary was hired, he was not the only Kubiak on the payroll, as his son Klein was already a player personnel assistant with the Broncos. There are not many times when a new head coach gets hired somewhere and literally can be given the grand tour of his new facility by his own son!\n\nOffensive coordinator Rick Dennison has spent more years with the Broncos, as player and coach, than any one else in franchise history. And to top it off, he went to Rocky Mountain High School in Fort Collins and then to Colorado State University.\n\nThat is a local angle that is going to be very difficult for anyone else to match as the years go by.\n\nDefensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who recently was named Co-Assistant Coach of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association, is one of the most popular coaches in team history.\n\nJust after Christmas, I was in the offices and a couple of coaches said Wade was looking for me. I found him and inquired as to whether he needed to see me. He said yes and to come to his office, where he proceeded to give me a Christmas gift of a homemade coffee that his wife Laurie makes during the holiday season.\n\nWhen they came back to Denver a year ago, I kidded to Laurie that I sure did miss her coffee, and it was a gift that did not come from a coach and his wife as much as from deep friendships.\n\nOur third coordinator, Joe DeCamillis, is a Denver native who started here as a young assistant under Dan Reeves. When he was hired by John and Gary he returned home not just to Denver but also to his parents' Arvada home. He stayed with his folks until he and his wife, Dana, bought their new home here.\n\nReally, how often does a veteran NFL coach get a new job and move in with his parents?\n\nNothing says family any tighter than that, but Dennison can actually match it. He still had a home in Denver and was able to move into his own residence!\n\nOf course, Tight Ends Coach Brian Pariani had the same role on the back-to-back World Championship teams in 1997 and 1998.\n\nDefensive Assistant Chris Beake is the son of former general manager John Beake and a young man whom I have known since he was a middle school student in Fort Collins.\n\nAssistant Wide Receivers Coach Marc Lubick is the son of Sonny Lubick, a state legend for the great job he did coaching for the CSU Rams before his retirement, and Marc might not even be aware that his family connection with the Broncos goes back two decades to when his sister, Michelle, was on my staff as a public relations intern.\n\nAnd sometimes family is best measured by the guys who never left, like Steve \"Greek\" Antonopulos, the only person heading to Santa Clara who has made that trip for all eight Denver Super Bowls.\n\nThis goes all the way to the top, as I remember the day--the actual day--when team President and CEO Joe Ellis was hired--not in his current role but in 1983 in his first stint with the team.\n\nAnd at the very top, Denver Broncos Owner Pat Bowlen not only has had his team go to more Super Bowls than any other owner in NFL history, but he has forged a tight bond with the city, state and Broncos Country that only comes from the outpouring of true emotion on all sides.\n\nI have written this with an eye toward just the facts.\n\nFor now, it is enough to say that the family sense which we all share is real, and forged over decades of mostly highs, a few lows, and plenty of passion all the way around.",

                    "body": "The Carolina Panthers are peaking at just the right time coming off their best performance of the year with a 49-15 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. There are three players in particular that are playing their best football of the season and have seen their stock rise to the highest it has been all season.\n\nPhilly Brown\n\nThe second year wide receiver entered this season with a great opportunity in front of him. The Carolina Panthers had lost their top wide receiver, Kelvin Benjamin, for the season during training camp and were looking for a player to step up. Eventually, Ted Ginn Jr. filled the void along with Greg Olsen and Philly Brown fell in the depth chart.\n\nAgainst the Arizona Cardinals, Brown showed exactly what kind of potential he has in this league with an 87-yard touchdown pass where he caught the pass, broke a tackle and won the foot race to the end zone. Brown had his first 100-yard game with four receptions for 113 receiving yards.\n\nHe has actually seen his role in this offense expand during the postseason, averaging three receptions, six targets and 67.5 receiving yards per game. This is above his regular season averages of 2.2 receptions per game, 3.9 targets and 31.9 receiving yards.\n\nAccording to Sporting Charts, the Denver Broncos were one of the better teams in the league limiting the opposition big play with only 26 given up all season. A strong game from Brown will help open up the Panthers' offense but it certainly won't be easy against the Broncos' defense.\n\nTre Boston\n\nAnother player who had high expectations entering this year was Tre Boston. As a rookie last year, he was one of the key additions to the starting line-up that helped the team finish strong and win a playoff game. The thought process was that he would remain the starter this year but free agent Kurt Coleman passed him on the depth chart for that spot.\n\nHe did get some playing time this year but not obviously as much as expected. The time he has been on the field, especially this postseason, he has made a serious impact. Boston saw extended playing time against the Arizona Cardinals when Roman Harper suffered an eye injury in the second quarter. He had two key plays that helped the Panthers run away from the Cardinals with a fumble recovery as well as an interception.\n\nThe Panthers are expecting to have their starting safety back next Sunday for the Super Bowl however Boston should see some time against Peyton Manning and this Broncos' offense.\n\nCharles Johnson\n\nDefensive end Charles Johnson is another player who has had a disappointing regular season but has responded in the playoffs with two strong games. The veteran missed eight weeks in the middle of the season when he was placed on injured reserve due to a hamstring injury.\n\nHe had one of the worst regular seasons of his career with only one sack, which is the lowest total since 2007, a year that he only played in three games.\n\nThe past two games though, Johnson has done a much better job getting to the quarterback. He has a sack in each of the past two games and it shouldn't be a considered a coincidence that Johnson's increase has helped the entire team get pressure on the opposing quarterback.\n\nAs a team, the Panthers have eight sacks this postseason however Peyton Manning is one of the best at avoiding sacks, even though he lacks scrambling ability. This is going to be a key storyline during the Super Bowl about whether the Panthers can get to Manning.\n\nTwitter @BrandonCroce.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @PanthersonScout and like our page on Facebook.",

                    "title": "Mason's Mailbag: Pass rush, savoring the moment, and more",
                    "body": "The Broncos are off to the San Francisco Bay Area for Super Bowl 50, and no matter what comes next, this is a moment to enjoy.\n\nAs always, you can tweet questions to me with the hashtag #AskMase or use the submission form to your right (if you're viewing on a standard browser) or at the bottom of the page if you're on the mobile site.\n\n#askmase why was the broncos pass rush against N.E. so dominant, when the pats eliminated the K.C. pass rush the week prior? -- Patrick Krohn (@KrohnPatrick)\n\nJanuary 29, 2016\n\nThree reasons:\n\n1) The Broncos' underneath coverage was better and more aggressive and disrupted the timing of New England's passing game, which forced an extra few split-seconds of hesitation. Tom Brady still got the football out in 2.43 seconds last Sunday, according to ProFootballFocus.com, but that was 0.21 seconds more than his average in the 10 previous games he'd played with Julian Edelman at his disposal.\n\n2) Denver's three-technique defensive ends were the best the Patriots had seen, and it showed. Their pressure was the first to shake Brady's pocket, and they did an outstanding job of getting their arms up to obstruct Brady's throwing windows.\n\n3) Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware had the Patriots' silent count pegged. I've never seen them so quick off the snap.\n\nThis was why the team fought all season for home-field advantage, and why the overtime wins over the Patriots and Bengals were so crucial. Without those wins, I think I'm answering questions about looming free agents and Senior Bowl standouts rather than the Super Bowl matchup, and certainly Miller and Ware would have been more susceptible to hard counts and offsides infractions.\n\nThe Chiefs have good defensive personnel. The Broncos have better players on defense, and last Sunday, they played like it.\n\n@MaseDenver How do us @Broncos fans get over post-SB48-stress syndrome to enjoy the buildup to SB50 and the game itself? #GoBroncos -- The Incredible Moppa (@IronicJohnGalt)\n\nJanuary 29, 2016\n\nYou need to try to forget about that team -- not in terms of the memories it created in going 13-3 and breaking a bushel of offensive records, but in terms of its construction. The 2015 Broncos are completely different: different strengths, different schemes, different coaches, different personnel. Just six players who started Super Bowl XLVIII are still with the team.\n\nThe other thing -- and this is a life lesson, not a football one -- is that everyone needs to relax and enjoy the moments of life a bit more. Go from day to day. Plan for the future, but marinate in today.\n\nAnd understand that just being in this game as often as the Broncos have been is a truly remarkable accomplishment.\n\nWhen considering the number of teams in the AFL and the AFC, the average rate of appearance would be once every 14.28 years, which translates to an average of 3.5 appearances over the 50-year history of the Super Bowl. The Broncos have been eight times. No one has been more often.\n\nThere's no guarantee that the rate of success will continue over the next half-century. The Miami Dolphins went to five of the first 19 Super Bowls ... and haven't been back. The Kansas City Chiefs went to two of the first four Super Bowls and are still waiting for their return appearances.\n\nEnjoy the build-up. For the next week, your team is at the center of the sports universe. People in all corners of the globe will see the Broncos run onto the field at the start of the game.\n\nOn game day, you can fret. I'm a fan of other teams; I get it. I've been so burned by Atlanta Braves postseason failures that I want to curl into the fetal position in front of my flat screen at the first sign of postseason misery. (This is not something I have to worry about this year.) But the demons of the past are only issues in the present if you allow them to be.\n\n\"People\" tend to use head-to-head as the reason Brady is better than Peyton; Brady is 11-6 all-time against Peyton. As a Broncos fan, I don't think any of us would agree (Brady usually struggles against us and Peyton used to destroy us). But for those that use head-to-head, does that imply that Brady is the worse playoff QB since his regular-season record is 9-3 and his playoff record is 2-3 against Peyton?\n\n-- Stephen Asai\n\nIt would, which is why you can't put much stock in the head-to-head results when evaluating which quarterback is better; it's a flawed measurement.\n\nQuarterbacks drive the car, but his teammates are the myriad parts in the engine and chassis, and if a receiver drops a pass or a piston stops firing, you're not going to get very far.\n\nIs Philip Rivers a bad quarterback because his team went 4-12? I think it's perfectly obvious that he's anything but; the San Diego Chargers -- and I still like typing \"San Diego\" -- had a Biblical plague of injuries that contributed to their demise.\n\nDo you think the NFL would ever consider taking away the cap hit on players that were drafted by the organization intending to re-sign them and only having a salary cap for free agents that were not homegrown? I believe teams should be rewarded for drafting well and not penalized by being forced to let guys go because of money. I think it really hurts the game and breaks our hearts when players we love are forced to leave.\n\n-- Nicholas Grycel\n\nConsider? Yes. But I don't think it would progress any further than that.\n\nOne of the key tenets of the NFL's success is its establishment of relative resource parity based on shared revenue from television contracts, merchandise sales and other profit streams. Teams keep what they make in premium-seat sales and local, team-only sponsorships, but this model has ensured competitive balance, and makes possible an environment where a team in Green Bay, Wisc. can go to seven postseasons in succession, and where mid-sized NFL markets like Denver and Carolina can go to the Super Bowl and no one bats an eye.\n\nThe salary cap helps perpetuate that balance. Without it, some teams with boundless resources in terms of local revenue and ownership largesse could simply outspend others, creating the sort of imbalance that exists in Major League Baseball or most soccer leagues around the world.\n\nCreating an exception to the cap for re-signing players would only help large-market, high-revenue teams who draft well; small- to mid-market teams would struggle to keep pace and wouldn't be in position to go above budget.\n\nAndrew, I've enjoyed the mailbag all season. Thanks for all you do to give us informed answers. My question is about the players on IR. How is Ryan Clady recovering from his injury? And Ty Sambrailo? How about Jeff Heuerman)? Also do Omar Bolden and David Bruton get to be on the sidelines during games? And do all of them get rings? I hope there's another mailbag because I'd love to hear your take on the NFC opponent in the Super Bowl.\n\n-- Becky Miller\n\nFirst, thank you for the kind words. The Mailbag will continue in the coming weeks and throughout the entire offseason; there's plenty to discuss, even after the last snap in Santa Clara, Calif. on Feb. 7.\n\nThe recoveries for those players have been smooth so far. Clady and Heuerman have been regular presences at the UCHealth Training Center throughout the season working on their rehabilitation; both are expected to be at full speed by the time NFL teams start their offseason programs in April. Sambrailo is expected to return at some point during offseason work; his recovery time was expected to be four to six months after he had his torn labrum repaired. If he is on the long end of that timetable, he would return in May.\n\nBolden and Bruton can be on the sideline during the Super Bowl, as long as it doesn't hinder their recoveries from injuries. And all of those players will get AFC Championship rings if the Broncos lose Super Bowl 50, and of course, the big piece of jewelry if the team gets it done against the Panthers.\n\nI noticed that in the NFL the halftime lasts 12 minutes (in the Super Bowl, it's 30 minutes). Do you think having half-time for about 23 minutes very similar to College Football will help the athletes to rest up?\n\n-- Ahmed Chowdhury\n\nA little extra rest couldn't hurt the players, but the biggest beneficiaries would be the fans in the stands, who would have time to go to the concession stand and the restroom and make it back to their seats in time for the start of the third quarter.\n\nCollege football has a 20-minute halftime. It's all right for the fans and the atmosphere; you get a marching-band performance, some homecoming festivities once a year, and other celebrations. But for the television audience, it's stretched out, and that's the reason why NFL halftimes are at just 12 minutes: television.\n\nPro football used to have 15-minute halftimes, but I don't expect those to return.\n\nMy question about the new two-point PAT rule: I was under the impression that if the opposing team were to cause a fumble or interception they could return it for two points themselves. Am I right or is that just wishful thinking?\n\nThey can. With Bradley Roby last Sunday, it was an issue of wanting him to go down and take a knee to end the play, because the Patriots could have returned a fumble of his to get the two-point conversion they needed.\n\nAs for Batman or Superman ... I'll take Superman, but I'm a Spider-Man guy.",

                    "body": "Super Bowl 50 is a battle of youth vs. wisdom at the quarterback position. Peyton Manning is 39 years old, potentially starting his final career game, and he will be looking for one more day in the sun, one more shining moment to go out as a champion.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 is one week away. February 7th is the day, Levi Stadium is the place. The Carolina Panthers will do battle with the Denver Broncos for the right to call themselves \"world champions\". One of the biggest storylines, the sentimental favorite for the game, the man who many want to see go out on top, is Peyton Manning.\n\nAt age 39, he is the oldest quarterback to ever start a Super Bowl. He has already won one with the Colts, and earned an MVP award, but that was a different Peyton Manning. This Manning relies on a strong running game and a strong defense, combined with the ability to complete timely passes. Gone are the days of Manning's right arm carrying the day. He must lean on his teammates, and lead with his head.\n\nThe question is, can he go out a winner? Can the football gods smile one more time, giving the cagey veteran one more day in the sun, confetti flying everywhere? Can Peyton Manning ride off into the sunset as a champion?\n\nThe answer is yes, but he is going to have to \"get by with a little help from his friends\".\n\nC.J. Anderson is going to have to be a big part of the equation. He may have only posted 720 yards rushing in 2015, but when he performs well, the Broncos win. In Denver's only three losses of the year, Anderson carried the ball less than ten times. Like we said before, if Manning is forced the throw the football 40 times, the Broncos don't have a shot. C.J. Anderson must be a major part of the offensive gameplan.\n\nIt rolls right into the other major key to the game for the Broncos' offense; time of possession. The Broncos averaged 22 points per game, the Panthers averaged over 31, leading the league. Getting into a shootout will not work for Denver. It may have worked a few years ago, when Peyton still had his signature zip and arm strength, but that is no more. Peyton can't stay with a game like that anymore.\n\nTo win this game, Peyton and the Broncos must be able to make 21-24 points be enough to get the job done.\n\nIt's possible, and a strong faction of the NFL fan public will be pulling for it.",

We've compiled a list to consider before betting on the game, in which bookmakers installed the Carolina Panthers as 6-point favorites over the Denver Broncos.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, oddsmakers gave no less than 22 teams a better probability than Carolina to win the title. A rash of preseason injuries, most notably losing top receiver Kelvin Benjamin for the year due to a torn ACL, dragged down the Panthers' odds. They could become the longest shot to win the Super Bowl since the 2001-02 New England Patriots, which also were 60-to-1.\n\nDenver was the fifth choice in the futures odds right before the NFL season kicked off, behind Seattle, New England, Green Bay and Indianapolis. The Broncos stayed at the same odds throughout the offseason, which was a surprise given past betting patterns. Bettors used to load up annually on teams led by quarterback Peyton Manning, but shied away before the 2015-16 season.\n\nPanthers' upside\n\nThe comfort of backing a team that has performed the best in the NFL all season sounds appealing. It may have been debatable whether Carolina belonged at the top going into the playoffs. It's not anymore.\n\nThe Panthers' 49-15 blowout of the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game built their average margin of victory to 13 points per game, higher than any other team. The Broncos beat their opponents by only 4 points per game.\n\nCarolina is without weakness, one of only two teams ranked in the league's top five in both offense and defense by Football Outsiders' advanced metrics. And the Panthers beat the other team, the Seattle Seahawks, twice this season, including in the divisional playoff round.\n\nBroncos' downside\n\nDenver's offense might be as much of a weakness as its defense is a strength. The Broncos average 5.2 yards per play to rank 24th in the NFL. In the past 15 years, the 2008 Steelers are the only team with a standing that low to win the Super Bowl.\n\nCalling quarterback Peyton Manning a shell of his former self would be stating it lightly. The legendary future Hall of Famer ranked last in passer rating among qualified quarterbacks in the regular season after throwing for nine touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Although Manning has no turnovers in two playoff wins, he's averaged just 5.7 yards per pass attempt.\n\nCarolina's Cam Newton has tallied 9.9 yards per attempt in the postseason. At the game's most important position, the Panthers have a major advantage.\n\nBroncos' upside\n\nCarolina may score 32 points per game, but Denver has given up that many points only once this season. The Broncos' defense has played at a transcendent level and will be the most dominant unit on the field.\n\nDenver gives up an NFL-low 4.5 yards per play to opponents. No team has posted a lower total since the 2008 Pittsburgh Steelers, who defeated the Cardinals in Super Bowl 43. The Broncos have the top defense both against the run, surrendering 3.3 yards per carry, and the pass, giving up 5.7 yards per attempt, so there's no clear way to attack them.\n\nThey've also burned gamblers betting against them as underdogs this season. The Broncos are 5-0 against the spread and 4-1 straight-up when taking points.\n\nPanthers' downside\n\nBuying low on teams is a hallmark of successful sports betting. Taking the Panthers in the Super Bowl is the polar opposite of that strategy. The Super Bowl spread swelled three points in some places, from minus-3 to minus-6, in Carolina's direction based solely on its dismantling of Arizona.\n\nIt's important not to overreact to one performance. The Panthers laid more than 4 points in sports books on eight occasions this season, going an underwhelming 3-5 against the spread in those games.\n\nThe single team among that group with a winning record was the Washington Redskins, which the Panthers smashed 44-16. But even the most committed Denver detractor would admit it's a big step up from Washington.\n\nKeefer's pick\n\nThe past three Super Bowls, and four of the past five, have soared over sports books' point totals. That will end this season; it's time for a defensive struggle in the biggest game of the year. Look for the total score to fall below 46 points. That means scoring will be at a premium, and every point becomes valuable. The betting market undervalues great defense, which will be what keeps Denver in the game. Take Denver +6.",

                    "body": "NFL Super Bowl 50 picks from the experts at CBS Sports are in, and they are surprising split in their predictions. While we have been hearing from the media the entire week that the Denver Broncos have no chance to defeat the Carolina Panthers, three out of the eight experts believe that Peyton Manning will be hoisting the Lombardi Trophy next Sunday night. Even though Carolina still has the majority of votes, it appears as though Manning and the Broncos have a real shot at defeating Cam Newton and the Panthers in the eyes of the experts. Here are all of the NFL Super Bowl 50 picks from CBS Sports.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 Schedule\n\nCarolina Panthers Vs. Denver Broncos (Sunday, Feb. 7, 2016 at 6:30 p.m. ET, CBS)\n\nThat @Broncos defense?\n\nAmazing.\n\nThe offense?\n\n\"We certainly want to carry our weight\" https://t.co/19cXV894yS pic.twitter.com/aUsSBHb6Zz\n\n-- NFL (@NFL) January 30, 2016\n\nUpdated Odds\n\nWhile the NFL odds are going to change throughout the next week based on injuries and how the bets are coming in, Vegas Insider has released the current odds for Super Bowl 50.\n\nCarolina Panthers: 6-point favorites over the Denver Broncos\n\nAs the Inquisitr previously reported, the Panthers were originally only 4-point favorites when the line opened last week. For it to move this much means that some pretty big bets are being placed on Carolina winning the game. As the week goes on, the line should drop slightly as more people place bets on Denver winning the game.\n\nRegardless, six points is a fairly large spread on a neutral field. While the Broncos do have a chance to win this game, the public seems to think that the Panthers will win handily.\n\n.@LevisStadium is ready 8 days out for @Panthers & @Broncos #sb50 pic.twitter.com/K4LiQfzQVp\n\n-- Brian McCarthy (@NFLprguy) January 31, 2016\n\nDenver Broncos Vs. Carolina Panthers - The Matchup\n\nOn paper, the Panthers should win Super Bowl 50. Quarterback Cam Newton may be the best player in the NFL right now, and their defense just shut down one of the most prolific offenses in the entire league in the Arizona Cardinals. Before defeating the Cardinals, the Panthers beat another extremely difficult team in the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nWhile the Broncos managed to defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots, neither team was playing its best football. The Steelers did not have star wide receiver Antonio Brown, and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was limited with an injury. The Patriots were still a great team this year, but their play towards the end of the season declined considerably.\n\nPeyton Manning vs Cam Newton will mark the first time starting QBs drafted No. 1 overall will meet in the Super Bowl pic.twitter.com/i9cd81bfv7\n\n-- ESPN (@espn) January 26, 2016\n\nAt this point in their careers, Newton is considerably better than Manning. While Manning is a future Hall of Famer, he looks like he is on his last leg. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, this may be his last game. While a victory could make it easier to go through with the retirement, a loss could have him coming back for more. Unfortunately for Manning, the choice may not be his.\n\nIf the Broncos want to win this game, they are going to have to rely on their elite defense and strong running game. Newton is going to be great regardless, so the Broncos will need to slow down running back Jonathan Stewart and prevent too many big plays from the rest of the Panthers offense.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 Expert Predictions\n\nAs previously noted, it is somewhat of a surprise that almost half of the experts at CBS Sports think the Broncos have a chance to win this game. Vegas is usually right on these things, and they are heavily favoring the Panthers. At the moment, this looks like it is going to be a repeat of Super Bowl 48 where Manning lost to Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks. Unfortunately for Manning, this Panthers team is actually very similar to the Seahawks team that beat him.\n\n[Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images]",

                    "body": "The Belmond-Klemme boys started off the week Jan. 18 against the Cadets from CAL. B-K looked to have the game in the bag in the first half, but the Cadets were not going to make this victory easy. The Broncos held on for the victory with a game-winning free throw from Cael Tenold.\n\nB-K's first half defense made scoring difficult for the Cadets. Leo Nelms and Tenold were the big scoring factor for the Broncos on this night. Going into the half, B-K had a commanding lead 34-19.\n\nBut the Cadets had a whole new look as they took the court in the second half, and B-K was in trouble as the Cadets cut their lead to 40-39 by the end of the third quarter. The man-to-man defense the Cadets employed bothered B-K and took the Broncos a while to get back into a groove. Big rebounds from Chris Aguilera helped the Broncos keep the lead. As the final seconds ticked down, Coach Jerry Lane set up a play for Tenold who took the ball at the top of the arch and shot a three-pointer. The basket didn't fall in, but the refs called a foul, so Tenold was on the line to shoot three free throws. All it would take was one to win the game and Tenold drained the basket. B-K walked off the court with a win 49-48.\n\nThe stats included....\n\nOn the following night, the boys travelled to Eagle Grove to face off against the Eagles in a much anticipated game. B-K knew they would have their work cut out for them - The \u2008Broncos were the victor in the earlier match this season and the Eagles were looking for revenge.\n\nEG started the game shooting lights out from the three-point line. The fast-paced game left the Broncos trailing 21-13 in the first quarter. Cael Tenold had eight points as Dan Chapman collected four rebounds. The Eagles continued to hit nearly every shot they took, and B-K struggled to find the basket in the second quarter. As the clock started to tick away, an Eagles buzzer beater left the Broncos trailing 42-23 at half. Chapman headed into the locker room with an impressive nine rebounds.\n\nThe Broncos started the third quarter with a big run. Chapman hit two big three-pointers, and B-K out-scored the Eagles 10-5 in the first two minutes. But that is all the closer the Broncos would get as the rest of the night was all Eagles. The Broncos continued to work hard and show determination during the rest of the game, but came up short, 72-45.\n\nTenold led his team with 19 points as Chapman had 11 rebounds. Other stats included....\n\nThe Broncos finished off their week with a tough game against conference leader Garner-Hayfield-Ventura in Belmond Jan. 22. The Broncos battled against the big boys of GHV who were some of the largest athletes that B-K has faced all year. Leo Nelms and Dan Chapman were the lone Broncos to score in the first quarter and the home team trailed 17-6 at the end of the first period. GHV ran the court and took advantage of their size to put up points quickly. Before the Broncos knew it, the Cardinals were leading 42-10 at half.\n\nBut in true Bronco style, the boys never gave up against the talented team, diving for every ball, reaching for every rebound and taking as many shots as GHV would allow. The second half was a struggle, and the B-K crowd continued to cheer on their beloved Broncos as fans could see the frustration on the athletes' faces. GHV continued to put up points and by the end of the third quarter had a dominating lead 57-15. It was a rough finish to the game as BK ended with only 19 points. The final score was 69-19.\n\nStats included....\n\nFor the entire store, order an on-paper or on-line subscription to the Independent. Call 641-444-3333.",

                    "body": "For only the fourth time in 50 years, two long-time former players will be the opposing coaches in the Super Bowl. And in the way that Ron Rivera and Gary Kubiak manage their teams, there is a message that coaches who want to follow them need to heed.\n\nWe're talking to you, Chip Kelly, but you're not the only one.\n\nTo be successful, a coach has to be willing to move out of his comfort zone, whether it is offense or defense, and figure out the other side of the ball.\n\nBill Belichick did that a zillion years ago, and despite what happened in Denver, the results seem to indicate he did it pretty well.\n\nSimply, offense and defense have to work together to make a team successful. It did not happen with Kelly's teams in Philadelphia, and unless he understands that running an offense with the lowest time of possession in the league is not helpful to his defense, he will come to the same end in San Francisco that he did with the Eagles.\n\nRivera is a good defensive coach with a great background weaned playing for the Mike Ditka-Buddy Ryan Chicago Bears of the 1980s.\n\nSometimes, coaches with a background on defense put their offense in a straitjacket, and beat themselves.\n\nRivera has not done that. As a player, he was part of a defense that shut down great offensive teams from San Francisco and Washington. And he knew he had a special talent in quarterback Cam Newton, so he gave offensive coordinator Mike Shula plenty of latitude.\n\nThere were no worries about the offense being too wide open and perhaps creating problems for the defense with turnovers or other issues. And the result? Carolina led the league in scoring, finished second to Denver in yards per play and had the league's best turnover differential.\n\nAnd the defense? Well, you might have seen what it did to Arizona, the league's No. 1 offensive team, based on yards per game. Clearly, Rivera learned something about offense while he was coaching defense.\n\nLikewise, Kubiak, once John Elway's backup quarterback with the Broncos and now the coach working for general manager Elway with the Broncos, knew he had to compensate for offensive shortcomings this year because of Peyton Manning's injury issues.\n\nAs an NFL quarterback, Kubiak learned about defenses by playing against them -- and, for most of his career with the Broncos, he saw how the lack of a decent defense impacted a great quarterback (Elway, not Kubiak).\n\nNow, as general manager, Elway provided him with the players, and they pulled Wade Phillips out of a year's retirement to run the defense.\n\nKubiak knew he had to tamp down his offensive instincts to help the defense, and he did, putting Manning under center instead of the shotgun more than in the past, and leaning heavily on the running game and the defense.\n\nYou saw what Denver's defense did to Tom Brady, and that was not an aberration. The Broncos allowed the fewest yards in the league during the regular season. They won the daily double, allowing the fewest rushing yards per play and also the fewest net passing yards per play. Oh, and they led the league in sacks per pass attempt.\n\nIf Denver had played defense like that during Elway's playing career, he might have won more than the two Lombardi trophies he embraced at the tail end. Worth noting, of course, is that Kubiak was the offensive coordinator for those two teams, and Kubiak's coaching mentor, Mike Shanahan, put together the kind of running game and defense that Elway's teams previously lacked.\n\nRivera's mentor, Ditka, was on the winning end of the last Super Bowl coached by two former long-time players, both Hall of Famers, in fact -- Ditka's Bears against Raymond Berry's New England Patriots 30 years ago. That one was notable for the defense Ryan coordinated for Ditka.\n\nThe other two matchups of long-time players-turned-coaches were the two Super Bowls between the Steelers and Cowboys in the '70s, with coaches Chuck Noll and Tom Landry. Both of them were longtime NFL players who earned their Hall of Fame chops as coaches, of course.\n\nWhen he coached the 49ers to three Super Bowl titles in the '80s, Bill Walsh developed Joe Montana and introduced us to the West Coast offense. He didn't get as much credit for defense with those teams, but the 49ers had some vicious hitters in the secondary and always had a strong, deep defensive line. Remember, it was a goal-line stand that helped them beat Cincinnati in Super Bowl XVI.\n\nThe Giants' Bill Parcells was a defensive coach but his quarterback, Phil Simms, completed 22 of 25 passes in a Super Bowl victory. The Raiders' Tom Flores, like Parcells a two-time Super Bowl winner, had a background on offense but a defense that mauled opponents and a linebacker, Rod Martin, who intercepted three passes in Super Bowl XV.\n\nIt's a clear message. The most successful coaches made sure they learned, or had someone they could lean on to lead, the other side of the ball. That's something the Broncos and Panthers clearly have.\n\nIra Miller is an award-winning sportswriter who has covered the National Football League for more than four decades and is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Selection Committee.

                    "title": "The Evolution of Von Miller",
                    "body": "For a fraction of a second, Von Miller was going in the wrong direction. After dropping back into coverage and watching tight end Rob Gronkowski move inside, Miller stood perpendicular to the line of scrimmage as he watched Tom Brady out of the corner of his eye. And then it happened.\n\nMiller, in a blur, swirled 180 degrees and stared Brady dead in the eye before leaping to snag his pass.\n\nOn back-to-back plays last Sunday in the AFC championship game, the outside linebacker first took Brady off his feet, hitting him on a first down, then fooling him on that second down for an interception that set up a Broncos touchdown.\n\nBy game's end, Miller not only had the interception and four of the Broncos' 20 hits on Brady, but also 2\u00bd sacks, a franchise playoff record.\n\n\"He gets almost parallel to the ground,\" said ESPN NFL analyst Tom Jackson, a former Broncos linebacker. \"When he's turning the corner, he is so low. There was one sack he got -- where he ran up behind Brady -- I almost lost him in the pack, because I lost sight of him as he turned the corner. Tremendous speed. Great get-off. He's got all of those things, and a lot of people would just take one of those.\"\n\nMiller put together one of the team's best defensive performances in playoff history on the biggest stage he had ever performed. But it was also the culmination of something else, an evolution of sorts that unfolded over the last couple of seasons.\n\nDave Meadows chuckled as he recalled Miller's request in 2006. Then the coach at DeSoto (Texas) High School, Meadows watched Miller rack up 76 tackles and six sacks as a senior, but there was one play that stuck with him.\n\n\"He always bugged us about wanting to handle the ball somehow,\" Meadows said. \"So his senior year -- he was fast enough now; he was a (4.5-second) guy in the 40 -- I told him he could return kickoffs. Well, the first game that he really got a shot at one, he ran one back 75 yards and it wore him out so much, he was pretty much shot. He couldn't play defense like himself for a while. He kept doing it, and he worked hard at it. He was pretty good. He was an unusual-looking kickoff guy back there, at 6-3, 215, but he could go.\"\n\nLong-armed and skinny, Miller's upper body had trouble keeping up with his lower half. The hours in the weight room were harder than the ones on the field, Meadows said. But the raw talent and sheer athleticism were obvious.\n\n\"He was a mismatch almost all the way through for an offensive lineman, just so quick and limber,\" Meadows said. \"I'm sure you've seen he can bend around those offensive tackles just before they're ready for him. He can almost go two directions at once. His head and shoulders are reaching around the guy for the quarterback and his feet are still moving forward.\"\n\nOther signs of the Miller that Broncos fans see today were also obvious. The happy-go-lucky Miller of today was a jokester then. His short attention span required his coach to keep tabs on his whereabouts. But when it was time to take the field, Meadows said, Miller was all business.\n\n\"Sometimes being popular is not a good thing, because they get involved in silliness and there was some of that with Von,\" Meadows said. \"Kind of a typical kid. But he matured.\"\n\nBy the end of his high school career, Miller was displaying the athleticism that helped him wreak havoc on offensive linemen throughout his four years at Texas A&M.\n\nThe 2010 Butkus Award winner and the No. 2 pick in the 2011 draft, behind Cam Newton, was that rare, complete package.\n\nBut even the shiniest gems need occasional buffing.\n\nThe first big blow was the six-game suspension, a punishment in 2013 that cost Miller more than $800,000 in salary for violating the league's substance-abuse policy and, at the time, had a chance of costing his team much more.\n\nWhen Miller returned later that season, after the Broncos' 6-0 run without him, he brought along some extra pounds, weight that appeared to hinder his explosiveness off the line. But the final blow to an already trying season was dealt less than two months later when Miller tore his anterior cruciate ligament, forcing him to miss the end of the regular season and the Broncos' trip to Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\nDenver, of course, went on to get blown out 43-8 at the hands of Seattle. Miller went on to rehab, spending many days in the training room alongside cornerback Chris Harris, who also missed the Super Bowl because of a torn ACL.\n\nMiller's next return proved to be his most important, a transformation his teammates noticed early -- \"Just his practice habits. More focused in the film room,\" Harris said -- that escalated with the arrival of one his idols, DeMarcus Ware.\n\nWare, a nine-time Pro Bowler who signed with the Broncos as a free agent in March 2014, was the walking example Miller needed at the time he needed it most.\n\nIn his two seasons in Denver, Ware has had a steadying influence on Miller, who led the Broncos with 14 sacks and 28 quarterback hits in 2014.\n\n\"Your coaches always tell you what leadership looks like, you got all the greats that come here and they tell you this and they tell you that, but having a real-life example right across from you, and him being my idol, it was just great,\" Miller said. \"I could come in and see what type of shoes he wears every day, how he laces up his shoes, how he came to work, how he handles adversity from the injuries and all this stuff. I got to see it up close and in person, and it just helped me become the type of person I am today.\"\n\nTwo-point-one-nine. The number was repeated early and often after the Patriots' divisional playoff victory over the Chiefs. Brady needed only 2.19 seconds, on average, to unload the football against Kansas City, down from his regular-season average of 2.35.\n\n\"You said two seconds? Sometimes I only need, like, one,\" Miller said jokingly before the AFC championship game.\n\nThe jovial Miller never left. But veiled behind the pre-game wit and sarcasm was a reality. Miller's first step at the line and his ability to change directions on a dime, fall back into coverage or move up to pressure Brady in the pocket were quicker -- and more powerful.\n\nTwice in the third quarter, Miller sprinted around the edge of the Patriots' line before lunging toward Brady from behind, wrapping his long arms around the quarterback's waist to make his legs fold like origami beneath him.\n\nThe speed left offensive tackles watching Miller from behind. The agility forced game-changing turnovers. The power left Brady powerless. The combination proved almost unblockable, causing heads to shake and eyes to roll in disbelief.\n\n\"I think he's grown up a lot as a pro and with preparation -- watching him get ready to play, study players,\" coach Gary Kubiak said. \"I mean, Von hasn't missed a day of work. He's a leader. He loves to play. You all watch him practice, he has a blast out here. He's a dancer at practice and all of those things, but he's very professional in his approach. It's shown by the way he's played this year.\"\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala\n\nPro Bowl selections, making him one of three Broncos to earn at least that many in his first five seasons\n\n58\n\nGames needed to record 50 sacks, making him the third-fastest player in NFL history to do so\n\n5\n\nSeasons with at least five sacks, making him one of three Broncos to post that many in his first five seasons\n\n60\n\nCareer sacks, putting him eighth in Broncos history\n\n32\n\nQuarterback hits this season, the most of the Broncos' 120 team total\n\n4\n\nSeasons with at least 10 sacks, making him one of three Broncos to do so over four seasons\n\n2\u00bd\n\nSacks vs. Patriots in AFC championship game, a Broncos single-game playoff record\n\n16\n\nForced fumbles since 2011, tied for third-most in the NFL in that span\n\nNo. 2\n\nDraft pick by the Broncos in 2011, behind Carolina's Cam Newton",

                    "title": "Von Miller's evolution a boon for Broncos",
                    "body": "For a fraction of a second, Von Miller was going in the wrong direction. After dropping back into coverage and watching tight end Rob Gronkowski move inside, Miller stood perpendicular to the line of scrimmage as he watched Tom Brady out of the corner of his eye. And then it happened.\n\nMiller, in a blur, swirled 180 degrees and stared Brady dead in the eye before leaping to snag his pass.\n\nOn back-to-back plays last Sunday in the AFC championship game, the outside linebacker first took Brady off his feet, hitting him on a first down, then fooling him on that second down for an interception that set up a Broncos touchdown.\n\nBy game's end, Miller not only had the interception and four of the Broncos' 20 hits on Brady, but also 2\u00bd sacks, a franchise playoff record.\n\n\"He gets almost parallel to the ground,\" said ESPN NFL analyst Tom Jackson, a former Broncos linebacker. \"When he's turning the corner, he is so low. There was one sack he got -- where he ran up behind Brady -- I almost lost him in the pack, because I lost sight of him as he turned the corner. Tremendous speed. Great get-off. He's got all of those things, and a lot of people would just take one of those.\"\n\nMiller put together one of the team's best defensive performances in playoff history on the biggest stage he had ever performed. But it was also the culmination of something else, an evolution of sorts that unfolded over the last couple of seasons.\n\nDave Meadows chuckled as he recalled Miller's request in 2006. Then the coach at DeSoto (Texas) High School, Meadows watched Miller rack up 76 tackles and six sacks as a senior, but there was one play that stuck with him.\n\n\"He always bugged us about wanting to handle the ball somehow,\" Meadows said. \"So his senior year -- he was fast enough now; he was a (4.5-second) guy in the 40 -- I told him he could return kickoffs. Well, the first game that he really got a shot at one, he ran one back 75 yards and it wore him out so much, he was pretty much shot. He couldn't play defense like himself for a while. He kept doing it, and he worked hard at it. He was pretty good. He was an unusual-looking kickoff guy back there, at 6-3, 215, but he could go.\"\n\nLong-armed and skinny, Miller's upper body had trouble keeping up with his lower half. The hours in the weight room were harder than the ones on the field, Meadows said. But the raw talent and sheer athleticism were obvious.\n\n\"He was a mismatch almost all the way through for an offensive lineman, just so quick and limber,\" Meadows said. \"I'm sure you've seen he can bend around those offensive tackles just before they're ready for him. He can almost go two directions at once. His head and shoulders are reaching around the guy for the quarterback and his feet are still moving forward.\"\n\nOther signs of the Miller that Broncos fans see today were also obvious. The happy-go-lucky Miller of today was a jokester then. His short attention span required his coach to keep tabs on his whereabouts. But when it was time to take the field, Meadows said, Miller was all business.\n\n\"Sometimes being popular is not a good thing, because they get involved in silliness and there was some of that with Von,\" Meadows said. \"Kind of a typical kid. But he matured.\"\n\nBy the end of his high school career, Miller was displaying the athleticism that helped him wreak havoc on offensive linemen throughout his four years at Texas A&M.\n\nThe 2010 Butkus Award winner and the No. 2 pick in the 2011 draft, behind Cam Newton, was that rare, complete package.\n\nBut even the shiniest gems need occasional buffing.\n\nThe first big blow was the six-game suspension, a punishment in 2013 that cost Miller more than $800,000 in salary for violating the league's substance-abuse policy and, at the time, had a chance of costing his team much more.\n\nWhen Miller returned later that season, after the Broncos' 6-0 run without him, he brought along some extra pounds, weight that appeared to hinder his explosiveness off the line. But the final blow to an already trying season was dealt less than two months later when Miller tore his anterior cruciate ligament, forcing him to miss the end of the regular season and the Broncos' trip to Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\nDenver, of course, went on to get blown out 43-8 at the hands of Seattle. Miller went on to rehab, spending many days in the training room alongside cornerback Chris Harris, who also missed the Super Bowl because of a torn ACL.\n\nMiller's next return proved to be his most important, a transformation his teammates noticed early -- \"Just his practice habits. More focused in the film room,\" Harris said -- that escalated with the arrival of one his idols, DeMarcus Ware.\n\nWare, a nine-time Pro Bowler who signed with the Broncos as a free agent in March 2014, was the walking example Miller needed at the time he needed it most.\n\nIn his two seasons in Denver, Ware has had a steadying influence on Miller, who led the Broncos with 14 sacks and 28 quarterback hits in 2014.\n\n\"Your coaches always tell you what leadership looks like, you got all the greats that come here and they tell you this and they tell you that, but having a real-life example right across from you, and him being my idol, it was just great,\" Miller said. \"I could come in and see what type of shoes he wears every day, how he laces up his shoes, how he came to work, how he handles adversity from the injuries and all this stuff. I got to see it up close and in person, and it just helped me become the type of person I am today.\"\n\nTwo-point-one-nine. The number was repeated early and often after the Patriots' divisional playoff victory over the Chiefs. Brady needed only 2.19 seconds, on average, to unload the football against Kansas City, down from his regular-season average of 2.35.\n\n\"You said two seconds? Sometimes I only need, like, one,\" Miller said jokingly before the AFC championship game.\n\nThe jovial Miller never left. But veiled behind the pre-game wit and sarcasm was a reality. Miller's first step at the line and his ability to change directions on a dime, fall back into coverage or move up to pressure Brady in the pocket were quicker -- and more powerful.\n\nTwice in the third quarter, Miller sprinted around the edge of the Patriots' line before lunging toward Brady from behind, wrapping his long arms around the quarterback's waist to make his legs fold like origami beneath him.\n\nThe speed left offensive tackles watching Miller from behind. The agility forced game-changing turnovers. The power left Brady powerless. The combination proved almost unblockable, causing heads to shake and eyes to roll in disbelief.\n\n\"I think he's grown up a lot as a pro and with preparation -- watching him get ready to play, study players,\" coach Gary Kubiak said. \"I mean, Von hasn't missed a day of work. He's a leader. He loves to play. You all watch him practice, he has a blast out here. He's a dancer at practice and all of those things, but he's very professional in his approach. It's shown by the way he's played this year.\"\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala\n\nPro Bowl selections, making him one of three Broncos to earn at least that many in his first five seasons\n\n58\n\nGames needed to record 50 sacks, making him the third-fastest player in NFL history to do so\n\n5\n\nSeasons with at least five sacks, making him one of three Broncos to post that many in his first five seasons\n\n60\n\nCareer sacks, putting him eighth in Broncos history\n\n32\n\nQuarterback hits this season, the most of the Broncos' 120 team total\n\n4\n\nSeasons with at least 10 sacks, making him one of three Broncos to do so over four seasons\n\n2\u00bd\n\nSacks vs. Patriots in AFC championship game, a Broncos single-game playoff record\n\n16\n\nForced fumbles since 2011, tied for third-most in the NFL in that span\n\nNo. 2\n\nDraft pick by the Broncos in 2011, behind Carolina's Cam Newton",

                    "title": "Denver Broncos' choice to wear orange in Super Bowl is weak, irrational",
                    "body": "Uniformity. White uniforms in the big one? Any certified Broncomaniac knows we should be wearing take-no-prisoners orange. How can you have an Orange Crush defense wearing wimpy white? How can we be \"United in Orange\" if we're not in orange? Stick with the big orange in the big one. It's what got us here.\n\nChuck, Golden\n\nKiz: Orange is a groovy color. But the four times Denver has worn orange in the Super Bowl, the Broncos' record is 0-4, with those losses by an average score of 42-9. Not to suggest the Broncos are superstitious, but if you believe they should avoid the mistakes of their most recent trip to the Super Bowl, we can understand why Peyton Manning will take the field wearing white and will take the first snap from under center (so the football can't go flying over his head).\n\nMoney talks. I am a Broncos season-ticket holder with a priority number lower than 1,000. I returned home from Denver's victory in the AFC championship game only to find an e-mail from the Broncos telling me I was not selected in the lottery for Super Bowl tickets but could go to their partner Prime Sports and purchase a package at a cost of more than $4,000. I think it is outrageous the Broncos spit on their season-ticket holders and try to tell us it's raining.\n\nDoug, representing the 303\n\nKiz: Here's one of the packages promoted by the Broncos: one game ticket, one round-trip airfare to Oakland, arriving and departing Sunday, one tailgate party with food, drinks and music. Cost? $5,595. Don't know what you call it. But I call it a rip-off.\n\nBad coaching. After watching the Broncos beat New England, I thought John Fox was still coaching Denver. How come nobody is calling out Gary Kubiak for basically trying to give the game to the Patriots? What kind of coach has a 20-12 lead with a chance to go to the Super Bowl and refuses to go get even a field goal to seal the game? He wasn't even trying to get one first down. His coaching job was one of the worst in playoff history.\n\nLars, Chicago\n\nKiz: Props to the Denver defense, which repeatedly thwarted the comeback efforts from Pats quarterback Tom Brady. If the Broncos employ the same fourth-quarter strategy against Carolina quarterback Cam Newton, however, the odds are he will find the end zone for the points required to beat Denver.",

                    "body": "Broncos president and CEO Joe Ellis addressed the team after practice Saturday as a reminder of the message and ways of longtime owner Pat Bowlen, who will miss Super Bowl 50 next Sunday as he deals with Alz- heimer's.\n\n\"We talk about Mr. B a lot,\" coach Gary Kubiak said. \"There are obviously a lot of older players in this organization that know him. There are people in this organization that know him extremely well, and there are young kids who have probably never met him -- maybe have not even seen him this year. We do that. I had Joe talk to the football team today before we called it a week about Mr. B, how he's doing and how he'd be very proud of this football team. It was a very good moment.\"\n\nVolume raised. Peyton Manning knows crowd noise can be a factor, which it was when the Broncos played the Seattle Seahawks at the Meadowlands in the Super Bowl two years ago.\n\n\"We're practicing with noise,\" Kubiak said. \"... Peyton mentioned that to me, so we took the approach this week to practice with noise.\"\n\nSharpe's take. Count Hall of Famer and former Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe among Broncos believers eagerly awaiting Super Bowl 50.\n\nAfter watching them defeat the Steelers and the Patriots to win the AFC championship, Sharpe believes the Broncos can defy the odds one more time.\n\n\"Nobody gave them a chance vs. the Patriots,\" Sharpe said. \"No one. If they go out there and play their game, I like their chances. Carolina's a very, very good football team. They have the best player in the NFL playing on their team and playing at a very, very, very high level. They also have an excellent defense. But this is special because no one saw this coming. No one. And yet, here they are.\"\n\nSuper send-off. For fans looking to catch a glimpse of the Broncos before the Super Bowl, they will depart team headquarters (off Potomac Street) at 12:45 p.m. Sunday. The team's buses will take their usual route to Denver International Airport, via E-470.\n\nHarris update. Cornerback Chris Harris' left shoulder may not fully heal before the Super Bowl, but he isn't too concerned. \"It hasn't kept me out the last three games, so I'm able to fight through it,\" he said.

John Hickenlooper.\n\nThe Broncos, who face off against the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 on Feb. 7, will fly out of Denver International Airport at 1:45 p.m. Sunday, as the rally gets into full swing. Their departure will be live streamed on a giant screen at the rally.\n\nHancock said the community is encouraged to attend the rally to support the Broncos in their quest for a third Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThe celebration will feature appearances from Miles the Mascot, the Broncos cheerleaders, several former players and music from DJ Chonz and the North High School Drum Line.",

                    "title": "Jussel: Defense gives Broncos a chance in Super Bowl 50",
                    "body": "There are times in football when the offense runs through or around the defense. Think Gale Sayers, Eric Dickerson, maybe even Terrell Davis.\n\nSometimes, offense travels via air. Dan Marino was unstoppable, Joe Montana seldom missed, and Peyton Manning, once upon a time, threw 55 touchdown passes in a single season.\n\nOther times, the defense simply cannot be handled. Think Da Bears with wild-eyed Mike Singletary in the middle or Baltimore's Ravens with Ray Lewis stonewalling everything.\n\nDenver's two Super Bowl titles, XXXII and XXXIII in the late '90s, came about because the Bronco offense could not be stopped thanks to the slashing runs of the aforementioned Davis and the still-lethal arm of quarterback John Elway.\n\nDenver's defense in those years? Mediocre.\n\nThe Broncos have been dominated five times in Super Bowl efforts.\n\nIn the first of those losses in Super Bowl XII, the Broncos had their Orange Crush defense, and it was respectable, holding the Cowboys to 27 points when they might have scored 40. But Denver's offense was anemic, scoring only 10 points behind aged QB Craig Morton and his replacement, Norris Weese.\n\nThe next three losses saw New York's Phil Simms, Washington's Doug Williams and San Francisco's Joe Montana pick Denver's mediocre defenses apart. Simms went 22 of 25 in XXI, Williams threw four TD passes in the second quarter in XXII the following year, and Montana threw for five TDs in XXIV.\n\nScores in those blowouts?\n\n39-20, 42-10 and 55-10.\n\nThe latest Denver loss against Seattle was ugly on both sides of the ball for the Broncos. Manning and the passing game that had set NFL records galore during the regular season were never a factor. Seattle QB Russell Wilson couldn't be stopped. Finally, it was 43-8.\n\nI'm bringing these previous mismatches up because Super 50 is a mismatch on paper, Carolina roughly a touchdown favorite.\n\nCarolina has a superb defense and they have the highest-scoring offense in the league. Denver has a superb defense, best ranking in the league, but an offense that, to be kind, is mediocre.\n\nAdvantage Carolina.\n\nThe Panthers arrive from the NFC with a record of 17-1. They were a legitimate threat to finish the regular season unbeaten, but they fell asleep at the wrong time.\n\nWhether it was too much Christmas cheer, too much confidence, maybe not enough respect paid an opponent, the Panthers only loss came Dec. 27 against the Falcons in Atlanta. The score was 20-13.\n\nJust two weeks prior to that game, the Panthers had blitzed the Falcons 38-0.\n\nDefensively, the Panthers are similar to what we have seen from Denver this season. They have terrific cover corners, incredible linebackers, and their front four puts up a good pass rush.\n\nThe biggest difference between Carolina and Denver defensively is that most of the Panther strength is on the inside, and most of Denver's is on the outside.\n\nThe Panthers offensively, of course, are dependent on quarterback Cam Newton. The closest comparison I can come up with to Newton and the Panthers is -- ta da! -- the Broncos and their dependence on Elway prior to the arrival of the super running back Davis.\n\nNewton is a 6-foot-5, 250-pound monster who has a cannon on his shoulder, Olympic dash speed in his legs.\n\nStop or slow Newton, however, and you might be able to contend with the Panthers.\n\nDenver's hopes ride on doing what Atlanta did in that second contest against the Panthers in which Newton threw for 142 yards and ran for 46. It was the only game of the season he did not throw a TD pass.\n\nThe Falcons also moved the ball against the Panthers in that game. Matt Ryan threw for 306 yards, and wide receiver Julius Jones had 178 yards on nine catches, one a 78-yard TD catch, clearly getting the best of Carolina's Pro Bowl corner Josh Norman.\n\nA deeper look inside the numbers would suggest Denver has a chance to slow the Panthers because, although the Panthers score more than 31 points per game (compared with 22.5 for Denver), they average only 11 more yards per game than Denver, 366-355.\n\nThe Panthers have done it with big plays from Newton, often after their defense has created a turnover.\n\nYes, Denver could win this seeming mismatch by doing what the Falcons, a team that finished 8-8, did a month ago: Keep Newton from beating you with his legs; make the Panthers repeatedly march the length of the field; and, oh yes, go find a few of those TD passes that Manning used to be so fond of.\n\nIt won't be easy -- beating Pittsburgh and New England wasn't easy -- but it could happen.",

                    "body": "Watching Super Bowl 50 at the McCarty household will be interesting. Travis, top left, is a long-time Panthers fan and his wife, Tara, top right, is a Broncos fan. The McCarty's children have different rooting interests as well, with Trevor, bottom left, a Carolina fan, and Trent, bottom right, cheering for Denver.\n\nGrowing up in Delta, Travis McCarty watched the Broncos lose Super Bowl after Super Bowl during his formative years.\n\nHe also saw what he called fair-weather Broncos fans, cheering hard for Colorado's team only to curse it after a defeat.\n\nThat didn't sit well with McCarty, now 37.\n\n\"Going through middle school and high school, Denver would go to the Super Bowl and lose,\" he said. \"Everybody around me would be, 'Go Denver,' and then they'd lose, and those same people would be, 'Denver sucks.' \"\n\nSo McCarty vowed if he ever had the opportunity to root for an NFL franchise from its inception, he'd stick with that team through the victories and losses. The Carolina Panthers were announced in 1993 and began playing in 1995.\n\nMcCarty, a Delta Panther, immediately connected with a Panthers franchise more than 1,800 miles away.\n\n\"I still have a soft spot in my heart for Denver because I was born and raised in Colorado, and I love the Broncos,\" he said. \"But I wanted to pick a team, from the beginning, and stick with them through thick and thin and be a real fan.\"\n\nHe said Carolina's owner, Jerry Richardson, pushed the Panthers ahead of the Jacksonville Jaguars, which also began playing in the NFL in 1995.\n\n\"The owner came out and said he was going to run his franchise in such a way that they want good players, but also good men,\" McCarty said. \"That sold me, and I've been black and blue ever since.\"\n\nMcCarty, a math teacher and junior varsity girls basketball coach, donned a blue and black leather jacket emblazoned with the Panthers logo after a basketball game Thursday. He said over various birthdays and Christmases he's received 15 Panthers jerseys, four jackets, three hats, car decals, lanyards and shoelaces.\n\nBut McCarty married a fellow Colorado native. His wife, Tara, grew up in Aurora, watching Broncos games with her father and grandfather.\n\nWith Tara as a longtime Broncos fan, there's been a light-hearted back and forth.\n\n\"The trash talking has already started, and it's really cool because we've been wanting this to happen for a long time, having both teams in the Super Bowl,\" Tara said. \"There's definitely some friendly banter.\"\n\nWhat makes this rivalry interesting, though, is the loyalties of their two sons: Trent, 10, and Trevor, 8.\n\nBoth parents joked that Trent is \"a mama's boy,\" siding with his mother in football loyalties.\n\n\"He's whatever mom is,\" Travis said. \"He doesn't even realize he's a Broncos fan. He just looks at mom and says, 'What am I?' And she says, 'A Broncos fan,' and he's a Broncos fan.\"\n\nThe allegiance of Trevor is a little more split. With him growing up in Colorado, Travis said, he's inundated with the Broncos. Still, Travis said he gets Trent \"into his Cam Newton jersey every now and then.\"\n\n\"I'm pushing hard for the young one,\" Travis said. \"It's a lost cause on the older one.\"\n\nTara said Trevor might actually lean toward the Panthers for two reasons. First, he's a rebel.\n\n\"My youngest is like a 13-year-old girl trapped in an 8-year-old boy's body,\" Tara said. \"He likes doing the opposite of what I do.\"\n\nBut there's a degree of compassion, too. Dad is a lonely Panthers fan in Broncos country.\n\n\"I don't know that he's truly a Panthers fan,\" Tara said. \"But he sees that his dad is the only one rooting for the Panthers and wants to join him.\"\n\nThere's some family crossover, too.\n\nTravis said there are family photos in Broncos gear at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. Everyone living in Colorado can pull for the Broncos a bit, he said.\n\nAnd there's another photo, taken at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Travis and his wife are in the field in customized McCarty jerseys. Travis is wearing his Panthers jersey, but Tara is still wearing a Broncos jersey.\n\nUltimately, Travis said, this Super Bowl will bring his family together and, on a fan level, give him a good result regardless of who wins.\n\n\"This is the first Super Bowl I have a guarantee of not being absolutely ticked off about the outcome,\" he said. \"Part of me hopes Denver can win for Peyton, but my team is Carolina. If Carolina wins, I'll have to walk on egg shells for about a week-and-a-half because my wife is a big, big Broncos fan. I'll be happy with anything, but I definitely want Carolina to win.\n\n\"It's going to be the best Super Bowl ever for me. Guaranteed positive outcomes. As long as nobody gets hurt and it's a great game, I'm happy.\"",

                    "body": "USA Today Sports' Lindsay Jones with a report from Denver practice as the Broncos prepare for Super Bowl 50.\n\n27 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe Denver Broncos think they have a secret weapon that will boost their bid to capture victory at Super Bowl 50, one that might be more likely to make the Carolina Panthers chuckle than quiver.\n\nThat's because it involves the use of Peyton Manning's, ahem, foot speed. And yes, you just read that right.\n\nManning, the Broncos' veteran quarterback, was never blessed with a lightning turn of pace to begin with. Now, at 39, with 18 seasons, four neck operations and Father Time weighing him down, you'd expect him to be more lumbering than ever.\n\n\"That's the thing,\" wide receiver Demaryius Thomas told USA TODAY Sports. \"Everyone thinks he can't run and won't run because you never see him do it.\n\n\"(Carolina) is not going to be ready for it. But he can run when he wants to. It is a weapon that is there for us to use.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDeMarcus Ware provides emotional fuel to Broncos' Super Bowl run\n\nRealistically, you can forget about Denver flipping the script and calling pre-planned run plays for Manning at Levi's Stadium. However, as the future Hall of Famer showed during last weekend's nail-biting AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots, he is fully capable of using his legs when he has to.\n\nIn the third quarter of his team's tense battle against Tom Brady and company, Manning took off on third-and-10 at his own 20-yard line, sprinting forward for a critical 12-yard gain that sparked the crowd and his teammates into delighted celebration.\n\n\"I looked up and saw that he had taken off and it was like, 'Whoa, there he goes,'\" center Matt Paradis said. \"He is not Usain Bolt, but I think it took a lot of people by surprise. He is a lot quicker than people think.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBroncos star Von Miller 'a big fan' of Cam Newton\n\nMore than anything, the run of Manning and his dive toward the first-down marker showed his intense desire for a second career Lombardi Trophy remains strong.\n\nClearly, his powers of physicality have waned, and the Broncos' tilt at the title in what could be his final season has depended much upon defense. However, Manning's ability to lead tactically or by example is undiminished.\n\n\"He has that heart to go out and do it,\" linebacker Brandon Marshall said. \"He has no fear. We are all ready to do whatever it takes and especially him.\"\n\nBRONCOS' ROAD TO SUPER BOWL 50:\n\nRoad to Super Bowl 50: One great photo from each Broncos game Fullscreen The AFC champion Denver Broncos, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning, are headed to Super Bowl 50 after a 12-4 regular season and pair of narrow wins in the playoffs.

                    "body": "Although Feb. 7 will be anything but a Super Sunday in New England.\n\nThat's because, instead of the Patriots, it'll be the Broncos playing in Super Bowl 50 against Carolina.\n\nAnd so, instead of seeing Tom Brady in a record seventh Super Bowl, trying to win a record fifth Super Bowl, we must brace for a week of stories about the young, ebullient, dancin', dabbin' and over the top celebratin' Cam Newton being compared to the aged, over the hill, headin' for his last rodeo, Peyton Manning.\n\nNewton is 26, in his prime, on top of his game. Manning is 39, his best years behind him, perhaps playing the last game of an NFL career that should culminate with his being selected on the first ballot to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nCam is huge -- standing 6-foot-5 and weighing 245 pounds -- with an outsized personality to match his physical presence. He has a strong, accurate arm and also is highly mobile. When Denver cornerback, and former Patriots standout, Aqib Talib last week referred to Newton as \"probably the most dangerous quarterback in the NFL right now,\" he was making a statement few would refute.\n\nThe runaway favorite to be named the NFL's MVP, Newton threw for 35 touchdowns this season and ran for 10. In the playoffs, he's thrown for three more and run for two.\n\nManning is immobile and no longer can make the throws he used to. His strengths now are his guile and his guts. After passing for an NFL-record 55 touchdowns in 2013, he threw for just nine this season and had 17 interceptions, second-most in the league. As for running, forget it. Manning has a total of just two rushing touchdowns in the last seven seasons.\n\nWe know that much of the focus of the upcoming week's Super Bowl coverage will be, not surprisingly, on Newton and Manning, comparing and contrasting the two quarterbacks, including the fact that the 13-year difference in their ages is the largest-ever between starting QBs in a Super Bowl.\n\nBut, as Pats fans were painfully reminded last Sunday, it's defense that wins championships.\n\nWhich is why the Broncos, who put an NFL season-high 20 hits, including four sacks, on a hurried and harried, battered and bruised Tom Brady, feel they have a shot at upsetting the powerful Panthers, who have lost just one of 18 games this season.\n\nDenver led the NFL in total defense, allowing just 283 yards per game, and also in passing defense, allowing 199 yards per game. The Broncos were third in the AFC in points allowed.\n\nBut that's probably still not good enough to beat Carolina because the Panthers, in addition to having the league's highest-scoring offense, also have a rugged defense.",

                    "body": "Broncos' pithy motto explains best counter to Panthers' stars\n\nThe three Broncos players in question for Super Bowl 50 because of health issues did not participate in practice fully on Saturday.\n\nAfter practice, Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said safeties Darian Stewart (sprained MCL in his right knee), T.J. Ward (sprained left ankle) and guard Louis Vasquez (sore knee) will be listed as \"questionable'' as the team heads to California on Sunday.\n\n\"I feel great,'' Ward told Denver reporters Saturday. \"I'm just resting and making sure I'm healthy when it comes Sunday. I'll definitely be ready to play.\"\n\nKubiak said the plan is for the reps of all three players to increase and return to normal participation once the team reaches California.\n\nSaturday was the Broncos' final practice at their Dove Valley facility. The team is scheduled to leave Denver 1:45 p.m. Mountain time with projected arrival at 3:30 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nFor the second consecutive day, the Broncos practiced in their indoor facility.\n\n\"We're practicing with noise,'' Kubiak said. \"It should be split right down the middle. I assume that's the way it is. Peyton [Manning] mentioned that [noise was an issue in Super Bowl XLVIII] to me, so we took the approach this week to practice with noise.''\n\nThe Broncos will practice at Stanford University's facility.\n\nKubiak's message to his players after their final Denver-area practice?\n\n\"He told us that we had a great week of practice and one of the best week's we've seen,'' cornerback Aqib Talib said. \"We look we're ready to play so we just have some polishing to do. Pack your bags and get right. Let's go.\"\n\nThough many NFL teams opt to leave their injured players at home instead of bringing them on a the road for fear they would be a distraction, the Broncos have included their injured players in their traveling party for road games all year.\n\nThat will not change for the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We're all in this together,'' Kubiak said. \"There are guys that we've lost through the course of the year. They've been a big part of us. They've been with us. One thing I ask guys to do when they're on IR is stay involved with the team -- don't just remove yourself. Guys have done that. It's important. Everybody is going Sunday. We're all together. We're going to do this together. That's the way we've been all year.\"\n\nKubiak's policy is a popular one among his players.\n\n\"When I was on IR, I definitely wanted to be there the whole time, so the guys that haven't been able to be with us the whole year, for them to go to the Super Bowl, that's a great opportunity for them,'' cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. \"That's cool by Coach allowing that to happen.\"\n\nLinebacker Von Miller said he likes that policy \"a whole lot better'' than the alternative.\n\n\"I'm a team guy,'' Miller said. \"I like being around my guys.''\n\nTwo years ago, Miller was one of those injured players who made the trip to New Jersey for the Super Bowl even though he was not going to play.\n\n\"That process being without my teammates and them being there and me being here probably was the toughest thing out of everything,\" he said.\n\nOne of the oddities for the Panthers this season has been the propensity of tight end Greg Olsen to be tackled inside the 5-yard line. Olsen has eight touchdown receptions this season, but has been tackled inside the 5-yard line on eight other occasions, leading teammates to tease him about how many more scores he would have if he was a better finisher.\n\n\"Sometimes that's the way things go,\" Olsen said. \"I would imagine on almost all those eight someone scored after me. I also can assist. I'll take it. Someone's got to.\n\n\"Sometimes those catches down there are in tight windows, you're getting hit, you don't always have the opportunity catch it in space. As long as the drives finish in a touchdown, we'll take it.''",

                    "title": "Denver Broncos wary of Carolina Panthers' knack for fast starts",
                    "body": "There seems to be a real concern among the Denver Broncos that it's imperative they win the first quarter of Super Bowl 50.\n\nThe Broncos are very aware of the Carolina Panthers' fast starts in this post-season. Quarterback Peyton Manning joked this week that the Panthers tend to score before the guy singing the national anthem is off the field.\n\nCoach Gary Kubiak was asked about that Friday.\n\n\"They've jumped out on a lot of teams this year. They've played ahead,\" Kubiak said.\n\n\"They've won turnover battles, the field-position battles. To win 17 games in this league, you've got to be doing a lot of things right, but that is something that's a big factor -- they've played very well early in games. Every time you cut the film on, the end of the first quarter, it's 14-0 or it's 17-3. So, yeah they've gotten off to some fast starts. It'll be important that we play well early.\"\n\nInclusion: Kubiak is bringing everyone on his squad - including players on injured reserve - to the Bay Area Sunday. Two years ago then-Broncos coach John Fox didn't bring injured players to the Super Bowl until the Thursday before the game.\n\nBroncos linebacker Von Miller, who was injured two years ago, sees this as a better course.\n\n\"Leaving on Thursday, the end of the week, everything is already done with and over with,\" Miller recalled. \"I'm a team guy. I like being around my guys. So it was tough (two years ago}. That process being without my teammates and them being there and me being here probably was the toughest thing out of everything.\"\n\nWhy not dance: Miller finds it absurd that Panthers quarterback Cam Newton draws criticism for how he celebrates.\n\n\"I mean, what, dancing after making big plays? I mean, I do the same thing,\" Miller said. \"If I was a quarterback, I'd probably be doing the exact same thing that he's doing.\"\n\nFamily legacy: What would the NFL be without a Colquitt special-teamer? Craig Colquitt won two Super Bowl rings with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Now one of his sons, Britton, can win a ring as the Broncos' punter. Another son, Dustin, punts for the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n\"I feel extremely blessed just to be in the NFL,\" Britton Colquitt said Friday. \"I feel lucky and blessed and I think about this when I play Dustin -- how many brothers are in the NFL? How many get to play each other twice a year? When you go to the Super Bowl, I think to go once is amazing. So many people don't even make it to the playoffs very often.\"",

That's hard on them, but coaches, administration, players, they've all done a really good job,\" Kubiak said. \"I really feel good getting on the plane tomorrow that they're close to being ready to go.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBroncos star Von Miller 'a big fan' of Cam Newton\n\nKubiak said that means three practice sessions held at Stanford University in Palo Alto should be shorter than normal and intended to sharpen and reinforce what the team worked on while they were still in Colorado.\n\n\"We'll continue our meetings and that stuff, and how we prepare to play, but I want them relaxed. They've done the work. I want them to enjoy themselves and get ready to go,\" Kubiak said.\n\nThat's a change from the way the Broncos handled their preparation before the Super Bowl two years ago, and it was different for defensive end Antonio Smith, who played in the Super Bowl with the Arizona Cardinals in 2008.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDeMarcus Ware provides emotional fuel to Broncos' Super Bowl run\n\n\"As players, Kubiak sprung it on us. But our coach believes in what he believes, and we believe in him,\" Smith told USA TODAY Sports. \"He believes us getting the bulk of our work now will help us next week, with all the things that are going to be going on, all the distractions. You already have a good baseline, where you won't be trying to take in knowledge and at the same time, you got all this other kind of stuff going on and you won't be able to focus as much.\"\n\nAnother change for the Broncos practice routine from their Super Bowl preparation two years ago was practicing with crowd noise. Though Levi's Stadium is considered a neutral site, the Broncos don't want to get caught unprepared if they find themselves needing to use a silent count on offense.\n\nThat happened on their first series in the Super Bowl against Seattle, when they opened the game backed up near their goal line. Quarterback Peyton Manning and former center Manny Ramirez miscommunicated on the opening snap and the ball whizzed past Manning's head and resulted in a safety.\n\n\"Peyton mentioned that to me, so we took the approach this week to practice with noise. We can always go the other way, that's a positive, so we tried to approach it that way,\" Kubiak said.\n\n148 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE",

                    "title": "Why this Broncos Super Bowl is Different for Me",
                    "body": "I've lived a half-hour-to-an-hour away from Cleveland my whole life. That I didn't grow up a Browns fan is pretty blasphemous. But being born in 1993 probably explains it. This is crucial for two reasons. One, there was no team for my parents to attach me to when I didn't have the choice. Two, I took my first steps during the O.J. Simpson chase, my first experience with a white bronco. Perhaps it was destiny.\n\nWhen I did have the choice to pick my own team, the Browns were too bad to hang onto. I've always prided myself on not being a bandwagon/fair-weather fan, but I think I realize now that probably played a role.\n\nWhen I was around nine years old, I didn't have a favorite team, but watched the Browns if I felt like paying attention to football that week. I remember the Tim Couch vs. Kelly Holcomb debates and getting a foam potato that said \"Couch potato\" on it from a local sports talk radio host. That was what I began growing up with.\n\nBut then I started to see other teams and players around the NFL. The first player that truly caught my attention and affection was Randy Moss, so much so that I almost became a Vikings fan.\n\nWhat stopped me was finding a blue jersey in my basement with the number 30 worn out. I didn't know whom it belonged to. I picked it up and saw \"Broncos\" on the front and the name \"Davis\" on the back. I didn't know who this \"Davis\" was, but thanks to the Internet, I found out.\n\nEver since then, and ever since Jake Plummer, who would eventually become my favorite player, went to Denver in 2003, I've been a Broncos fan through thick and mostly thin (thank you, Pat Bowlen).\n\n*\n\nAt some point between the AFC championship game in 2006 and the Josh McDaniels era, I made a promise with my parents that if the Broncos ever make the Super Bowl, I would get a ticket and forgo my Christmas presents for the next five years.\n\nUnfortunately for them, I didn't know the actual value of money and they didn't know that I would remember this and take it to heart, carrying it with me for almost 10 years when the Broncos actually made the Super Bowl.\n\nSo over the years when Super Bowl ticket prices went through the roof and I was ignorantly hoping my parents were keeping a \"Get Dan to the Super Bowl\" fund, of course I didn't have the resources to go. That was the only thing that didn't line up for me (besides the Broncos getting blown up and almost shut out).\n\nThe Broncos finally made the big game and it was within driving distance of my home (I am deathly terrified of flying). Combine this with my biggest childhood dream of going to the Super Bowl still staying with me all these years and my disappointment when the day actually came overshadowed any excitement I had going into the game.\n\nWhen I tell people I know that that was one of the worst days of my life, they get it, but they don't really get it.\n\n*\n\nFrom the time I believed I would eventually get to a Broncos Super Bowl to the time they actually got there, a lot happened in my life that typical teenagers go through: going to high school, getting new friends, losing friends (and even best friends), losing family members, and going to college. There were a lot of tough moments that literally everyone goes through, but that I had a tough time handling.\n\nThe Broncos were one of the few things in my life that were able to remain consistent for me. I got to watch them every Sunday. I even became a regular at a local restaurant that carried the Broncos games when my area didn't have them that week.\n\nSports are pretty trivial, but when you go through tough times, or even what you perceive as tough times, you turn to things that are always there for you. For me, those things were my parents and my Broncos.\n\nWhen it was set that the Broncos would be playing in MetLife Stadium, I felt like I had gone through enough adversity to deserve a trip to New Jersey, as if that actually matters or that I actually knew what real adversity was.\n\nWhen I sat in my living room watching the pregame events I was beyond bummed out. I tried to work up some fake goose bumps, but it was worthless. It kind of worked out that I was miserable before the game because there was literally nothing to be happy about during it.\n\nI was upset about not being there to watch that colossal disappointment and I was upset that I was at home where it wasn't a big deal to anyone but me. (There should've been banners hanging up and a cake for me. This was my Super Bowl too!!).\n\nThis led me to seriously contemplating becoming a Browns fan, since I felt it was more fun to cheer for a bad team with a group of people than cheer for a good team alone.\n\nAt halftime, I drove an hour back to my apartment, which was 15 minutes away from where I go to school. I heard Percy Harvin's opening half touchdown return on the radio.\n\nI couldn't sleep that night, or many nights that year. I lived off-campus. I felt alone and unproductive (which caused me to move back on campus and get more involved). And ultimately, I learned the obvious that even with a Broncos Super Bowl win, I still had to go to school the next day. I don't get a ring, to touch the trophy, or even get to attend the parade that would be almost 1,500 miles away.\n\n*\n\nAt the beginning of the 2015 season, I wanted to make an effort to try to make watching Broncos football as fun for me now as it was in 2005.\n\nAs weird as it sounds, Brock Osweiler playing helped.\n\nExpectations can and did hamper the potential for pure elation I feel when watching sports. My favorite Broncos season prior to 2015 was 2011, when the Broncos started 1-4, finished 8-8, and Tim Tebow and Demaryius Thomas capped off the best win in my fandom.\n\nWith Peyton Manning, no matter what age he's at, most expect to see a highly talented offense and wins no matter what. When that doesn't happen, whether it's in a game or throughout the course of the season, it feels like a waste. I wanted to get away from that.\n\nI built up this expectation throughout the years that when the Broncos finally win the Super Bowl, I'll be there celebrating with my dad (who is a Browns fan, maybe?) and fellow Broncos fans. That would be the best feeling in the world.\n\nSuper Bowl 48 forced me to change my expectations about what a Broncos Super Bowl would be like. Osweiler allowed me to do a similar thing on a week-to-week basis. I didn't know what to expect, which made the wins a lot more fun and the losses heartbreaking instead of maddening (which I considered a good tradeoff).\n\nNow with Manning starting again, and me at a different place in my life, I'm taking everything I've learned over the past few years and will try to implement them to making this a more enjoyable Super Bowl experience for me.\n\nI still don't have the money to go, though I would have the heart to fly. I'll be watching the game right where I was for the 35-point loss. And even though I won't be physically watching with anyone that cares about the result, I've learned to deal with that.\n\nBecause of where I live in relation to where the Broncos play, it means the world to me when I see people in my area with Broncos gear on or when a friend or someone on social media tells me \"good luck,\" shares my joy in a victory, or even for a split second empathizes with me in a loss (not that I don't welcome friendly trash talk).\n\nThe Broncos mean about as much to me as you can care about a football team with it still not actually coming close to how much you care about your family. I'd like to think I know the pecking order now.\n\nNow, more so than the last few years, I'm able to have an appreciation for the fact that I get to watch something that I have been watching since I had the ability to label things that truly mattered to me. At the same time, I think I'm more able than I was in the past to take this game for what it is. I'm watching my favorite team play in the biggest game in the world. And that's what makes it great for me. It's the consistency I've always looked for and have always had.",

                    "body": "USA Today Sports' Lindsay Jones with a report from Denver practice as the Broncos prepare for Super Bowl 50.\n\n17 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe Denver Broncos think they have a secret weapon that will boost their bid to capture victory at Super Bowl 50, one that might be more likely to make the Carolina Panthers chuckle than quiver.\n\nThat's because it involves the use of Peyton Manning's, ahem, foot speed. And yes, you just read that right.\n\nManning, the Broncos' veteran quarterback, was never blessed with a lightning turn of pace to begin with. Now, at 39, with 18 seasons, four neck operations and Father Time weighing him down, you'd expect him to be more lumbering than ever.\n\n\"That's the thing,\" wide receiver Demaryius Thomas told USA TODAY Sports. \"Everyone thinks he can't run and won't run because you never see him do it.\n\n\"(Carolina) is not going to be ready for it. But he can run when he wants to. It is a weapon that is there for us to use.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDeMarcus Ware provides emotional fuel to Broncos' Super Bowl run\n\nRealistically, you can forget about Denver flipping the script and calling pre-planned run plays for Manning at Levi's Stadium. However, as the future Hall of Famer showed during last weekend's nail-biting AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots, he is fully capable of using his legs when he has to.\n\nIn the third quarter of his team's tense battle against Tom Brady and company, Manning took off on third-and-10 at his own 20-yard line, sprinting forward for a critical 12-yard gain that sparked the crowd and his teammates into delighted celebration.\n\n\"I looked up and saw that he had taken off and it was like, 'Whoa, there he goes,'\" center Matt Paradis said. \"He is not Usain Bolt, but I think it took a lot of people by surprise. He is a lot quicker than people think.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBroncos star Von Miller 'a big fan' of Cam Newton\n\nMore than anything, the run of Manning and his dive toward the first-down marker showed his intense desire for a second career Lombardi Trophy remains strong.\n\nClearly, his powers of physicality have waned, and the Broncos' tilt at the title in what could be his final season has depended much upon defense. However, Manning's ability to lead tactically or by example is undiminished.\n\n\"He has that heart to go out and do it,\" linebacker Brandon Marshall said. \"He has no fear. We are all ready to do whatever it takes and especially him.\"\n\nBRONCOS' ROAD TO SUPER BOWL 50:\n\nRoad to Super Bowl 50: One great photo from each Broncos game Fullscreen The AFC champion Denver Broncos, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning, are headed to Super Bowl 50 after a 12-4 regular season and pair of narrow wins in the playoffs.

                    "body": "Get ready for the invasion. The Denver Broncos are coming to the Bay Area, as are the Carolina Panthers, and a lot of their fans, and corporate executives and hangers-on and other Super Bowl enthusiasts willing (or even eager) to join the mobs and traffic jams.\n\nHere's what to expect over the next few days.\n\nTHE NFL EXPERIENCE: Part carnival, part NFL skills test, part museum, the pro football \"interactive theme park\" opened yesterday at the Moscone Center in San Francisco and will remain open every day through the Super Bowl. Check times before you go.\n\nTOUCHDOWN!: The Broncos are scheduled to land at Mineta San Jose International Airport at approximately 2:30 p.m. today. The Panthers touch down at the same airport at about 3:30 p.m. They will not be gathered around one of the luggage carousels.\n\nCIRCUS COMES TO TOWN: The annual Super Bowl Media Day has evolved into Super Bowl Opening Night. It will be held at SAP Center in San Jose (where the Sharks play) from 5 to 8 p.m. on Monday. Watch for scantily clad models, Star Wars costumes, clown outfits and other tools of the journalistic trade.\n\nCHANGE OF LEVI'S: Levi's Stadium, home of the 49ers, has been given a major facelift. The south end is painted with the Broncos logo, the north end with the Panthers logo. The Broncos are the designated home team and will use the 49ers' locker room, though for some reason the Panthers will stand on the 49ers' sideline. Denver has elected to wear its white jerseys, perhaps because the team is 0-4 wearing orange in the Super Bowl.\n\nPRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE: The Broncos will stay at the Santa Clara Marriott and practice at Stanford. The Panthers will stay at the San Jose Marriott and practice at San Jose State. All practices are closed to the public.\n\nAWARDS SEASON: The NFL will announce its Man of the Year and Coach of the Year awards on Friday. The next night the league will divulge its Player of the Year, and the 2016 Pro Football Hall of Fame class will be announced. Among the finalists are former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. and wide receiver Terrell Owens, and late Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler.\n\nAND FINALLY: Yes, there is a game. Kickoff is slated for 3:30 p.m., Feb. 7, at Levi's. Ticket prices on StubHub were starting at $3,000 on Friday. It's free to watch from your home on CBS.\n\n-- Phil Barber",

                    "title": "Road to the Super Bowl: How the Broncos reached Santa Clara",
                    "body": "Here's a quick breakdown of how the Denver Broncos went 14-4 on their way playing in Super Bowl 50 against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nThe Broncos won a crucial week 16 game against the Cincinnati Bengals with Brock Osweiler as their quarterback. But the next week Peyton Manning returned to the starting lineup in the third quarter and led four scoring drives as the Broncos defeated San Diego 27-20 to clinch the AFC West, a first-round bye and home-field advantage. Manning has been diminished this season, but it was the right call.\n\nIt had to be the Broncos' 29-13 loss to the Chiefs in week 10. Not only did their lose to their AFC West rivals, Manning -- who was playing through foot and rib injuries -- suffered plenty of embarrassment when he was lifted in the third quarter after completing only 5 of 20 passes for 35 yards and four interceptions. The Broncos only fell to 7-2 with the loss, but the performance did cast some doubt on whether they'd be able to close the season strong.\n\nThe Chiefs' pain in week two was the Broncos' gain when cornerback Bradley Roby recovered Jamaal Charles' fumble with 27 seconds left in the fourth quarter and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown that snapped a tie and gave the Broncos a 31-24 victory, their seventh straight over the Chiefs. The game made a significant difference in the final standings, too. Had the Chiefs won, they would have won the AFC West.\n\nOutside linebacker Von Miller is the Broncos' best player and an elite pass rusher who must be accounted for at all times. Miller, 26, used quickness, speed and pass-rush savvy to tally 35 tackles and 11 sacks this season. Denver's defense features several outstanding players, but Miller is the man who makes it go.\n\nCoach Gary Kubiak's decision to turn to Manning in week 17 wasn't necessarily a gimme. Osweiler had completed 14 of 22 passes for 232 yards, with a touchdown and two interceptions, and the Broncos only trailed 13-7 when Kubiak turned to Manning in the third quarter of the Chargers game. Manning entered to a standing ovation, and the Broncos haven't lost since.\n\nIn the AFC Championship Game, the Broncos did what the Chiefs could not the previous week, which is batter Tom Brady. The Broncos hit New England's star quarterback more than 20 times in a 20-18 victory after the Chiefs hit him just twice in the divisional round. It was a testament to the strength of the league's best pass rush, which is guided by one of the league's best defensive minds in defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. After years of Denver being an offensive juggernaut, Manning's descent due to age and injuries has been offset by the Broncos' outstanding defense.",

                    "body": "The Carolina Panthers are a popular pick to beat the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50. Anyone who runs a sportsbook in Las Vegas can tell you that, judging by all the money that's coming in on Cam Newton and Co.\n\nHowever, maybe you need more proof before you decided who to bet on. OK, fine. Let's turn it over to the fine folks at Tecmo Bowl, the legendary arcade game.\n\nAccording to their simulation, the Panthers are indeed going to win. But will it be a blowout? Oh, no. This is going to be a tight one that ends with Cam Newton hoisting the Lombardi Trophy with a 17-7 victory.\n\nCam starts the scoring when he finds Ted Ginn along the left sideline wide open for a 70-yard touchdown pass. Apparently the Broncos defense was in a two-deep zone and the safety on Ginn's side bit on tight end Greg Olsen's route in the middle of the field. Tsk, tsk.\n\nPeyton Manning later sets the Broncos up with a juicy opportunity when he finds running back CJ Anderson open on a wheel route out of the backfield for a 47-yard gain that gets them down to the Panthers' 16 yard line. However, disaster strikes on the next play when Manning goes to Anderson on a beautifully set up screen, but the latter coughs up the ball at the 4-yard line. A scrum ensues and Carolina linebacker Thomas Davis comes up with the ball, broken arm and all.\n\nAnd although Denver would close to gap to 10-7 on a Ronnie Hillman touchdown -- the Panthers close it out with a Jonathan Stewart score in the fourth quarter. Game, set and match.\n\nAll told, the stat line wasn't great. Hillman had a game-high 61 yards rushing while neither quarterback was able to complete at least 50 percent of his passes.",

                    "body": "Although Feb. 7 will be anything but a Super Sunday in New England.\n\nThat's because, instead of the Patriots, it'll be the Broncos playing in Super Bowl 50 against Carolina.\n\nAnd so, instead of seeing Tom Brady in a record seventh Super Bowl, trying to win a record fifth Super Bowl, we must brace for a week of stories about the young, ebullient, dancin', dabbin' and over the top celebratin' Cam Newton being compared to the aged, over the hill, headin' for his last rodeo, Peyton Manning.\n\nNewton is 26, in his prime, on top of his game. Manning is 39, his best years behind him, perhaps playing the last game of an NFL career that should culminate with his being selected on the first ballot to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nCam is huge -- standing 6-foot-5 and weighing 245 pounds -- with an outsized personality to match his physical presence. He has a strong, accurate arm and also is highly mobile. When Denver cornerback, and former Patriots standout, Aqib Talib last week referred to Newton as \"probably the most dangerous quarterback in the NFL right now,\" he was making a statement few would refute.\n\nThe runaway favorite to be named the NFL's MVP, Newton threw for 35 touchdowns this season and ran for 10. In the playoffs, he's thrown for three more and run for two.\n\nManning is immobile and no longer can make the throws he used to. His strengths now are his guile and his guts. After passing for an NFL-record 55 touchdowns in 2013, he threw for just nine this season and had 17 interceptions, second-most in the league. As for running, forget it. Manning has a total of just two rushing touchdowns in the last seven seasons.\n\nWe know that much of the focus of the upcoming week's Super Bowl coverage will be, not surprisingly, on Newton and Manning, comparing and contrasting the two quarterbacks, including the fact that the 13-year difference in their ages is the largest-ever between starting QBs in a Super Bowl.\n\nBut, as Pats fans were painfully reminded last Sunday, it's defense that wins championships.\n\nWhich is why the Broncos, who put an NFL season-high 20 hits, including four sacks, on a hurried and harried, battered and bruised Tom Brady, feel they have a shot at upsetting the powerful Panthers, who have lost just one of 18 games this season.\n\nDenver led the NFL in total defense, allowing just 283 yards per game, and also in passing defense, allowing 199 yards per game. The Broncos were third in the AFC in points allowed.\n\nBut that's probably still not good enough to beat Carolina because the Panthers, in addition to having the league's highest-scoring offense, also have a rugged defense.",

                    "title": "Denver Broncos' choice to wear white in Super Bowl is weak, irrational",
                    "body": "Uniformity. White uniforms in the big one? Any certified Broncomaniac knows we should be wearing take-no-prisoners orange. How can you have an Orange Crush defense wearing wimpy white? How can we be \"United in Orange\" if we're not in orange? Stick with the big orange in the big one. It's what got us here.\n\nChuck, Golden\n\nKiz: Orange is a groovy color. But the four times Denver has worn orange in the Super Bowl, the Broncos' record is 0-4, with those losses by an average score of 42-9. Not to suggest the Broncos are superstitious, but if you believe they should avoid the mistakes of their most recent trip to the Super Bowl, we can understand why Peyton Manning will take the field wearing white and will take the first snap from under center (so the football can't go flying over his head).\n\nMoney talks. I am a Broncos season-ticket holder with a priority number lower than 1,000. I returned home from Denver's victory in the AFC championship game only to find an e-mail from the Broncos telling me I was not selected in the lottery for Super Bowl tickets but could go to their partner Prime Sports and purchase a package at a cost of more than $4,000. I think it is outrageous the Broncos spit on their season-ticket holders and try to tell us it's raining.\n\nDoug, representing the 303\n\nKiz: Here's one of the packages promoted by the Broncos: one game ticket, one round-trip airfare to Oakland, arriving and departing Sunday, one tailgate party with food, drinks and music. Cost? $5,595. Don't know what you call it. But I call it a rip-off.\n\nBad coaching. After watching the Broncos beat New England, I thought John Fox was still coaching Denver. How come nobody is calling out Gary Kubiak for basically trying to give the game to the Patriots? What kind of coach has a 20-12 lead with a chance to go to the Super Bowl and refuses to go get even a field goal to seal the game? He wasn't even trying to get one first down. His coaching job was one of the worst in playoff history.\n\nLars, Chicago\n\nKiz: Props to the Denver defense, which repeatedly thwarted the comeback efforts from Pats quarterback Tom Brady. If the Broncos employ the same fourth-quarter strategy against Carolina quarterback Cam Newton, however, the odds are he will find the end zone for the points required to beat Denver.",

                    "body": "The only times the Broncos won the Super Bowl, Mike Shanahan coached the team. So it makes plenty of sense for current Broncos coach Gary Kubiak, a member of Shanahan's staff in 1997 and 1998, to rely on lessons learned from his old boss in preparation for the team's next shot at winning another title.\n\n\"I saw Mike last week, spent some time with him. I watched him prepare for these games,\" Kubiak said, via Troy Renck of the Denver Post. \"Yeah, I take a lot with me on what Mike taught me and how he prepared this team for these types of situations.\"\n\nShanahan praised Kubiak for joining a championship-caliber team with sky-high expectations and delivering.\n\n\"Anytime you go into situation where a team has won and they expect you to win and get back to a Super Bowl, it's very hard to do that,\" Shanahan said, via Renck. \"Gary has met the challenge. And you can see why his leadership skills have given them the ability to get back to the Super Bowl. I know Gary as well as anybody -- he's not happy with just getting there. He wants to win it.\"\n\nOne big difference between 2013 and now: Broncos on injured reserve are making the trip with the team and appearing in the team photo. For Super Bowl XLVIII, the injured players arrived later in the week.\n\n\"It shows the true team aspect. Everybody has contributed,\" cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said, per Renck. \"Look at a guy like [left tackle Ryan] Clady. He has missed both Super Bowls [with injuries]. I definitely know this means a lot for him.\"\n\nWhile that difference alone won't turn the 43-8 blowout loss into a win, it contributes to the kind of vibe that could help overcome the widespread perception that the Panthers will win the game.",

                    "body": "Carolina's RoboQB Cam Newton said people \"haven't seen nothing that they can compare me to.\" But haven't we seen this story line before?\n\nHe is the Next Big Thing in the ever-expanding Big Bang evolution of offensive football. He's part of an NFL lineage that once turned heads and dropped jaws when Fran Tarkenton had the audacity to leave the pocket in the early 1960s. Or when Randall Cunningham was chewing up yards with those long strides in the 1980s and '90s. Or when 264-pound Daunte Culpepper was running over defensive linemen and launching deep balls to Randy Moss while finishing MVP runner-up to Peyton Manning in 2004.\n\nAt 6-6, 260 pounds, Newton literally is bigger than any one of the defensive linemen who formed the Vikings' famed Purple People Eaters in the 1960s and '70s. He is, as he likes to show us, Superman. But he's not the first super man to defy comparisons heading into the Super Bowl.\n\nSo let's be careful not to accelerate the Cam Coronation until the favored 17-1 Panthers play Manning and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 next Sunday in Santa Clara, Calif. After all, five of the past eight underdogs have won the Super Bowl.\n\nIn 1984, a youngster with an arm and a quick release we had never seen before played in the Super Bowl after throwing for an unfathomable 48 touchdowns and 5,084 yards. But in Super Bowl XIX, Dan Marino's Dolphins scored 16 points in a blowout loss to the 49ers. Marino played 15 more seasons, 17 overall, and never made it back to the Super Bowl.\n\nIn 1990, Buffalo's \"K-Gun\" offense was unique and top-ranked. Favored by a touchdown in Super Bowl XXV, the Bills lost 20-19 in the game that launched the head coaching career of a young Giants defensive coordinator named Bill Belichick.\n\nIn 2001, St. Louis' \"Greatest Show on Turf\" was pinball-machine offense that led the league in scoring despite ranking 26th in turnover differential (minus-10). In Super Bowl XXXVI, the 14-point favorites scored 17 points and lost to Belichick's Patriots.\n\nIn 2007, those Patriots were a never-seen-before 18-0. They set records for points (589), touchdowns (75) and point differential (plus-315). Tom Brady threw for a record 50 touchdowns. Moss caught a record 23 of them. And, as 12-point favorites, they lost to the Giants while scoring 14 points in Super Bowl XLII.\n\nAnd let's not forget 2013. Manning had a season never seen before. He posted records for touchdown passes (55) and passing yards (5,477) as the Broncos -- like this year's Panthers -- led the league in scoring and point differential. The Broncos lost 43-8 to Seattle in Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\nIf this pattern of the never-seen-before offense being corralled by a standout defense continues, the person to credit will be John Elway.\n\nOnce upon a time, long before Newton arrived from planet Krypton to dominate and dance, it was Elway who was the quarterback who defied all comparisons in Denver. No one ran and threw like Elway, who was 25 pounds heavier than Tarkenton and 45 lighter than Newton.\n\nIn his current role as Broncos general manager, Elway has shown a football IQ that goes beyond playing quarterback. After the Seahawks humiliated the one-dimensional Broncos two years ago, Elway went to work on this team's toughness.\n\nHe signed DeMarcus Ware, T.J. Ward, Aqib Talib, Owen Daniels and Darian Stewart. He fired a successful coach in John Fox and turned to Gary Kubiak for a more balanced offense. He hired Wade Phillips, the defensive coordinator and true star in this year's Super Bowl run.\n\nCome Sunday night, someone will be raising the Lombardi Trophy at midfield. It very well could be Newton accepting his place in history as the 26-year-old Next Big Thing.\n\nOr it could be the 55-year-old Elway and the 39-year-old Manning, a couple of Past Big Things who now have the posse to prevent the presumed Cam Coronation.",

                    "body": "Paige: Dolphins can help Broncos plant AFC's best playoff seed\n\nWith a Broncos victory next Sunday, Gary Kubiak will become the first man in NFL history to win a Super Bowl as a head coach with the same team he played on and was an assistant coach with in previous Super Bowls. Kubiak, front and center in his seventh Super Bowl, owns three championship rings -- two with the Broncos and one with the 49ers.\n\nWith a victory, Kubiak will emerge from the illustrious long shadows cast by John Elway, Steve Young, Mike Shanahan, Dan Reeves, Terrell Davis and Peyton Manning.\n\nGary, at last, will radiate in his own limelight.\n\nAn illumination, though, that he never sought. Kubiak always felt more comfortable in the background -- as he again was, literally, when Elway accepted the AFC Championship Trophy last Sunday evening. As he was when Young, Davis and Elway were named Super Bowl MVPs, when Shanahan was The Mastermind in 1990s, as Reeves would define the Broncos in 1980s, and when Peyton Manning decided in 2015 to return for a final season in Denver. The Kubiak and Manning offenses would be coalesced. That was the plan before Manning was injured and had to be benched by Kubiak, then made another triumphant comeback.\n\nThe focus in Santa Clara, Calif., this week will be on Manning, at 39 the oldest quarterback to start in a Super Bowl, and the franchise's former quarterback, the oldest to win a Super Bowl. Along with defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the coach most bystanders believe is most responsible for the team ascending to its eighth Super Bowl.\n\nKubiak will shrug and won't care a whit about attention. All week he will answer questions in a mild-mannered, forthright voice, then resume his film study, his time with assistant coaches and his family, his practices and his alone time with concentration on how the Broncos will beat the Panthers.\n\nGary's mind is difficult to enter. He doesn't open it to the media often. Nobody calls him an offensive genius or considers him a Hall of Fame candidate. He's not a Belichick or Ryan, Shanny or Foxy, Lombardi or Landry.\n\nRather, Kubiak is a guy's guy, a players' coach and a diligent, determined detailer.\n\nHe was The Definitive Backup and is, somewhat, The Reluctant Head Coach.\n\nFor a couple of months, after he was taken in the eighth round of the 1983 draft, Kubiak's goal was to compete to become the Broncos' starting quarterback. Then, Elway -- drafted No. 1 overall -- was acquired in a trade, and Kubiak would become an afterthought, a kick-holder, and Elway's roommate and caddie. Kubiak was the quarterback behind the throne in Denver for nine seasons -- outlasting all but four of the 15 quarterbacks he joined the league with -- and never uttered an evil word or took a jealous breath. He retired without fanfare and into obscurity as a college assistant.\n\nYears later, Kubiak was chosen as the head coach at the University of Colorado -- and, a day later, he backed out. He was the quarterbacks coach with the San Francisco 49ers and the man who could have been the head coach by 1997. Instead, he left to rejoin the Broncos as Shanahan's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Eventually, he would become the coach of the Houston Texans.\n\nYet, after he collapsed on the sideline during a nationally televised game, and after he was fired at the end of a disastrous season, Kubiak settled back into an offensive coordinator's role with the Ravens. All he did was produce another potent offensive running game, and all he did at the end of season was reject offers to interview for four head coaching jobs.\n\nUntil Elway called, and said come home to the Broncos.\n\nHe replaced a coach who had guided the Broncos to a Super Bowl.\n\nAs head coach, Kubiak, through turbulent waters on offense, led his Broncos to a 12-4 record, five victories against playoff-bound teams and postseason victories over teams with first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterbacks.\n\nGary didn't blink.\n\nHe's not the mastermind, and he doesn't mind. He doesn't want a home in Cherry Hills or the best car in the parking lot or an Armani suit. He wears sneakers and eats takeout.\n\nOn the first day of training camp in 1983, Elway came out of the ancient Broncos locker room, and media mosquitoes swarmed. Kubiak walked out moments later, and I was the only media member who approached. As we talked, Kubiak understood well he was to be the sideshow at the circus, the forgotten quarterback.\n\nThe 54-year-old coach is a lot like that 23-year-old rookie -- genuine, likable, understanding, understated, intent on keeping his head down, pushing forward and being the best he can be at coaching, as he was at playing, and staying out of the high beams.",

                    "title": "Terrell Davis says Super Bowl is about who has the best day, not the best team",
                    "body": "The Denver Broncos, who battled their way to a 12-4 regular season record and Super Bowl berth on the back of a dozen wins by seven points or less, don't need to be best team, says Hall of Fame finalist and Broncos great Terrell Davis, they just need to be better than the Carolina Panthers on one day. That's a tall task, considering Carolina steamrolled their way to a 15-1 regular season record and have outscored their playoff opponents 80-39 so far. The Super Bowl is about who has the best day, not who has the best team.\n\n\"Obviously the better team,\" Davis told Eric Goodman and Les Shapiro on Mile High Sports AM 1340, \"if you want to look at numbers and look at records, people would suggest that Carolina is. They only lost one game. But I don't think it matters who's the best team. To me it's about who's going to play the best that day. That's all that matters, just one game.\"\n\nIt's a curious role reversal from the last time the Broncos were in the Super Bowl, where they entered the game with a record-setting offense that appeared unstoppable. The Seattle Seahawks and their stifling defense, not to mention an ill-prepared Broncos team, turned a game in which the Broncos were favored by two into a 43-8 runaway. That can happen, says Davis, because in football the \"best\" team doesn't always win; the team that has the best day does.\n\n\"In basketball, the best team wins,\" Davis said. \"You're in a seven-game series or five-game series, it's hard to beat a team that is better than you. But in football, that's not the case. It just takes that one Sunday. That you've got to come prepared to play and you have to play better than that team that one day. There's all kinds of mitigating factors that factor into that. That's why I love football. We [analysts] can sit here all day and we can say, 'Hey the Broncos are down, they're four point underdogs and they should lose this game,' but there's a lot of reasons you could make a case they could win this game.\"\n\nA case can certainly be made for Denver because of their defense, which ranked the best in the league in total yards, passing yards and sacks, and finished in the top five in rushing and scoring.\n\n\"They have a defense that is unique ... I don't think [Panthers quarterback] Cam [Newton] has seen a defense like Denver. As many athletes as they have on the front line, the linebacking corps is solid, the secondary is consistent and very solid back there, where they can run man with you all day long.\"\n\nStill, Davis couldn't deny how impressive Carolina has been throughout the season.\n\n\"I think a lot of it too - I mean, look at Carolina - look at this machine that they've built. It is hard to poke holes in the weaknesses of this team,\" he admitted. \"They have a top-ranked defense [No. 6 overall]. They have an offense that was the highest-scoring offense in football. The have a quarterback who's unique in his skill set and is difficult to game plan [against]. So I get it.\n\n\"The good news is, the people who make those predictions, they don't play. That's the good news. I'm sure if you're on the Broncos that that is just fuel to the fire. That's just allowing you to focus more and giving you a little more of an edge ... so I don't think they mind being underdogs.\"\n\nDenver has thrived this year in the underdog role, one they were thrust into when future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning struggled in the early parts of the year, then was sidelined with injury, and as the offense struggled to score points both with Manning and Brock Osweiler at the helm. Still, Denver more often than not scored enough points to deliver victory, including in an AFC Championship that many analysts expected to be a runaway for the New England Patriots. As home underdogs in that game, Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips engineered perhaps the greatest game plan of his life and his defense executed it to a T, sacking Tom Brady four times and hitting him 23 times on the day.\n\n\"We'll see what Wade Phillips has in store,\" Davis said, \"because everyone was pretty shocked at the game plan he unleashed against New England. It was a great game plan.\"\n\nPhillips will have two full weeks to cook up another doozy to overwhelm another favored quarterback in Cam Newton. For Davis, he wants to see how the team conducts itself during the week leading up to the game before he makes any kind of predictions about the final outcome.\n\n\"I'm going to go down there this week and watch these teams and see how they act. Obviously, media day is big. But at the end of the day, when that game starts, we really don't know what's going to happen. It could take a turnover here or there, or somebody comes out and doesn't play well, and [their team] could lose.\"\n\nDavis knows it's not about who's favored, or even who's the best team on paper. It's all about who has the best Sunday.\n\n\"You have to remember, I was in the backfield when we played the Packers. If I recall, we were double-digit underdogs.\"\n\nThey were, and they won Denver's first Super Bowl.\n\nListen to the full interview with Davis, including a discussion on his Hall of Fame candidacy, in the podcast below...\n\nCatch Afternoon Drive with Goodman and Shapiro every weekday from 4p-6p on Mile High Sports AM 1340 or stream live any time for the largest local lineup covering of what's new and what's next in Colorado sports.",

No media day. No team picture.\n\nTwo years ago, the Broncos chose to leave all of the players on injured reserve behind in Denver. Those players, a list that included two other defensive starters as well as left tackle Ryan Clady, did not join the team until later in the week, when players' families arrived.\n\nIt was an uncommon and very unpopular move, and one new Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak isn't making this year. Injured Broncos players, including safeties David Bruton and Omar Bolden, and left tackles Clady and Ty Sambrailo, will be with the team when they leave Denver Sunday afternoon.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBroncos star Von Miller 'a big fan' of Cam Newton\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" Kubiak said. \"One thing I ask guys to do when they're on IR is stay involved with the team -- don't just remove yourself. Guys have done that.\"\n\nHarris tore his ACL in the divisional playoffs in January 2014, after playing more defensive snaps than any other player in the regular season, so missing the Super Bowl week was especially painful. He said this week that he appreciates the decision Kubiak made to allow the players that are currently injured to travel.\n\n\"Being injured and watching it, people don't understand how it feels to watch the Super Bowl when your team is actually there and you actually contributed the whole season and couldn't play in it. So to be able to play in this game is huge for us,\" Harris said.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver's road to Super Bowl 50Road to Super Bowl 50: One great photo from each Broncos game Fullscreen The AFC champion Denver Broncos, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning, are headed to Super Bowl 50 after a 12-4 regular season and pair of narrow wins in the playoffs.

No media day. No team picture.\n\nTwo years ago, the Broncos chose to leave all of the players on injured reserve behind in Denver. Those players, a list that included two other defensive starters as well as left tackle Ryan Clady, did not join the team until later in the week, when players' families arrived.\n\nIt was an uncommon and very unpopular move, and one new Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak isn't making this year. Injured Broncos players, including safeties David Bruton and Omar Bolden, and left tackles Clady and Ty Sambrailo, will be with the team when they leave Denver Sunday afternoon.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBroncos star Von Miller 'a big fan' of Cam Newton\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" Kubiak said. \"One thing I ask guys to do when they're on IR is stay involved with the team -- don't just remove yourself. Guys have done that.\"\n\nHarris tore his ACL in the divisional playoffs in January 2014, after playing more defensive snaps than any other player in the regular season, so missing the Super Bowl week was especially painful. He said this week that he appreciates the decision Kubiak made to allow the players that are currently injured to travel.\n\n\"Being injured and watching it, people don't understand how it feels to watch the Super Bowl when your team is actually there and you actually contributed the whole season and couldn't play in it. So to be able to play in this game is huge for us,\" Harris said.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver's road to Super Bowl 50Road to Super Bowl 50: One great photo from each Broncos game Fullscreen The AFC champion Denver Broncos, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning, are headed to Super Bowl 50 after a 12-4 regular season and pair of narrow wins in the playoffs.

                    "body": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- The Denver Broncos closed their last practice at their suburban Denver complex before they depart for the Bay Area on Sunday with a reminder about why those who make decisions for the Broncos do what they do.\n\nTeam president/CEO Joe Ellis spoke to the team following Saturday's practice about Broncos owner Pat Bowlen. Bowlen, who is battling Alzheimer's Disease, stepped away from the team's day-to-day operations in the summer of 2014. The Broncos now have a locker room full of players who may not have ever met the man who Ellis and executive vice president of football operations/general manager John Elway say is at the root of every decision the team makes.\n\nWhen Ellis finished making his remarks, the players applauded loudly before going into the locker room.\n\n\"(Ellis) talked about Mr. B, how he was doing and how he would be proud of this football team,\" Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said.\n\nBowlen was inducted into the team's Ring of Fame earlier this season. Super Bowl 50 will be the Broncos' seventh Super Bowl appearance under Bowlen's ownership. The team has been to a record-tying eight Super Bowls overall.\n\n\"Mr. B was one of us, out here at practice, in the weight room,\" Kubiak said.\n\nThe Broncos went through their regular-season schedule this past week in terms of meetings and practice times. Kubiak said he wanted the team to leave Denver on Sunday as if it could play the Super Bowl this week.\n\nKubiak said the Broncos will stick to their usual game-week schedule during practices at Stanford, but since so much was done this past week, he may adjust how much time the team spends on the practice field.\n\n\"Boy, we had a really good week, guys are really focused,\" Kubiak said. \" ... We'll stay in our routine, but we'll probably be a little shorter. Hopefully we're short and very sharp ... I want them relaxed.\"\n\nThe Broncos also tied up one loose end in practice this week when they used music blaring out of the loudspeakers around the practice field when the offense had the ball.\n\nSeveral Broncos who were on the roster in 2013 have said they didn't practice with noise prior to the 43-8 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII. And crowd noise in MetLife Stadium from the Seahawks fans impacted the Broncos' first play from scrimmage in that game, when Manny Ramirez's snap simply flew past quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\nThe play resulted in a safety, and things never did really get any better for the Broncos for the remainder of the game.\n\n\"We're practicing with noise ... Peyton mentioned that to me,\" Kubiak said. \"So we took the approach this week to practice with noise.\"",

                    "body": "\"The [Denver] Broncos have a bunch of guys playing up front that really shouldn't be playing,\" Former Bronco Mike Schlereth told a CBS affiliate just days before the divisional playoff round against the Pittsburgh Steelers. \"They should be backups or street free agents looking for work, is really where they should be. But those guys are playing. That's what they have right now and you kind of just got to go with what you got and that's all they got.\"\n\nThat is just a recent taste of the vitriol the Super Bowl 50 bound players have received all season. The criticism has been fair at times and many experts believed that there was no way the Broncos could succeed with the patchwork line they had to play with. They have struggled through losing Ryan Clady months before the season, injuries throughout the year and three players receiving their first starts in the NFL. Along the way they have played poorly for significant stretches, yet here they are, one of the last two teams standing.\n\n\"We really just don't pay attention to that stuff. We just go out there and try to do our job as best we can. We are offensive lineman. We don't expect to be in the limelight or anything like that. People are going to talk,\" rookie guard Max Garcia said Saturday. \"Its expected. We haven't performed perfect throughout the season.\"\n\nThe Broncos surpassed their season sacks allowed totals from 2013-14 before the December arrived and they looked like they couldn't be counted on for a consistent running game but they persevered through it all. Head coach Gary Kubiak summarized the tough task the line had all season Friday and assigned credit where it is due ahead of the franchises' eighth Super Bowl appearance.\n\n\"You go back to losing Ryan [Clady] the first day of OTAs; I think Week 2 or Week 3, we lose [T] Ty [Sambrailo], and boy it didn't look good. We're able to get [T] Ryan [Harris]. Ryan was sitting here at home wherever he lives here, in Thornton I think, but yeah, that's been a tough road. We've been very fortunate those guys that have stayed one piece for us all year long,\" he said. \"I think [Offensive Line Coach] Clancy [Barone] and [Assistant Offensive Line Coach] James [Cregg] had a tremendous challenge with a first-year center [Matt Paradis]. Now [T] Michael [Schofield] has been a first-year right tackle for 12 to 13 games, and then Ryan coming in. I've been impressed with the job they've done, and we've used them all.\"\n\nAfter a five sack game by the Oakland Raiders' outside linebacker Khalil Mack in the Broncos' week 14 loss, the line, Schofield in particular, took another beating in the media. However, they improved, allowing 11 sacks in the teams last five games while also run blocking much better than the first ten games. In the last six games of the regular season the Broncos averaged 135.1 rushing yards per game, good for seventh in the league.\n\nNewcomer guard Evan Mathis admitted that the line had improved greatly ahead of their AFC Championship with the New England Patriots but also added he could really not care less about what outsiders have to say about his play. \"I really don't pay attention to all that so I have no idea. My focus is our game plan and just doing my job,\" he said Jan 21.\n\nGarcia has been a linchpin for the Broncos, subbing in for both Mathis and Louis Vasquez due to injury or simply keep their veteran legs fresh for the postseason and Saturday he had time to reflect on his journey to the big game ahead.\n\n\"I've been very fortunate to be a part of this team. To have had a part in this whole journey is pretty incredible. I have been able to contribute to the team as a rookie, that's amazing. I owe it all to my teammates that have helped me develop and grow as the season has gone forward. We have just been growing as a unit and really believe that is why we are here.\"\n\nSchofield has given up the most sacks on the team and has taken the brunt of abuse directed at the line but he also has grown through the line's comradery saying, \"I don't think I have ever been on a closer unit,\" and he knows what they have to do in order to get the final say.\n\n\"I really don't read what the media says, it just matters what we think. We just have to go out there and play how we know we can play. If we do that, success comes,\" He said Saturday.\n\nOffensive coordinator Rick Dennison, a person who has participated in six Super Bowls as a coach or player, knows what it takes to get to this point and despite the ups and downs, has appreciate his players' mental toughness through it all.\n\n\"They just keep going. I think they're grinders. They work hard. They practice hard,\" he said Friday. \"You can just take it one play at a time and just keep grinding at it one play. If it didn't work out last time, go to the next one. That's one thing about the whole team, particularly us on offense.\"\n\nTheir path to the Super Bowl was riddled with obstacles to say the least and Feb 7. The offensive line will face the regular season's fourth ranked rush defense, sixth ranked overall defense of the Carolina Panthers but at least they won't be distracted or surprised by being called the \"weak link.\" In fact, a win in Super Bowl 50 will be all the validation they need and will do all the talking for them.",

                    "body": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- The Denver Broncos closed their last practice at their suburban Denver complex before they depart for the Bay Area on Sunday with a reminder about why those who make decisions for the Broncos do what they do.\n\nTeam president/CEO Joe Ellis spoke to the team following Saturday's practice about Broncos owner Pat Bowlen. Bowlen, who is battling Alzheimer's Disease, stepped away from the team's day-to-day operations in the summer of 2014. The Broncos now have a locker room full of players who may not have ever met the man who Ellis and executive vice president of football operations/general manager John Elway say is at the root of every decision the team makes.\n\nWhen Ellis finished making his remarks, the players applauded loudly before going into the locker room.\n\n\"(Ellis) talked about Mr. B, how he was doing and how he would be proud of this football team,\" Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said.\n\nBowlen was inducted into the team's Ring of Fame earlier this season. Super Bowl 50 will be the Broncos' seventh Super Bowl appearance under Bowlen's ownership. The team has been to a record-tying eight Super Bowls overall.\n\n\"Mr. B was one of us, out here at practice, in the weight room,\" Kubiak said.\n\nThe Broncos went through their regular-season schedule this past week in terms of meetings and practice times. Kubiak said he wanted the team to leave Denver on Sunday as if it could play the Super Bowl this week.\n\nKubiak said the Broncos will stick to their usual game-week schedule during practices at Stanford, but since so much was done this past week, he may adjust how much time the team spends on the practice field.\n\n\"Boy, we had a really good week, guys are really focused,\" Kubiak said. \" ... We'll stay in our routine, but we'll probably be a little shorter. Hopefully we're short and very sharp ... I want them relaxed.\"\n\nThe Broncos also tied up one loose end in practice this week when they used music blaring out of the loudspeakers around the practice field when the offense had the ball.\n\nSeveral Broncos who were on the roster in 2013 have said they didn't practice with noise prior to the 43-8 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII. And crowd noise in MetLife Stadium from the Seahawks fans impacted the Broncos' first play from scrimmage in that game, when Manny Ramirez's snap simply flew past quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\nThe play resulted in a safety, and things never did really get any better for the Broncos for the remainder of the game.\n\n\"We're practicing with noise ... Peyton mentioned that to me,\" Kubiak said. \"So we took the approach this week to practice with noise.\"",

                    "body": "Since the NFL would have forfeited millions in deposits on hotel rooms and a stadium, it decided to go ahead and play a Super Bowl this year, even though an NFC West team isn't playing.\n\nIt's the first time that's happened since 2012.\n\n(Let's pause a moment here to let Cardinals fans wipe away tears.)\n\nThere are still plenty of story angles to follow this week in advance of the game in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 7, and even if there weren't, we media miscreants would find some to justify the $300-plus a night hotel rooms.\n\nThe Panthers opened as a three-point favorite over the Broncos, but the betting public is so enamored with Cam Newton and crew that the line has grown to six.\n\nAZCENTRAL\n\nCardinals XTRA app: Get the latest news, analysis, scores, more\n\nThis makes the Broncos underdogs, even though the Panthers believe they are loved only by close family members. (And they have questions about some of them.)\n\nThat's one of many story lines that will be dissected over the next week. Here are a handful of others:\n\nPeyton Manning's last rodeo.\n\nAn NFL Films microphone picked up Manning saying to Patriots coach Bill Belichick near midfield after the AFC Championship Game last Sunday that this could be the quarterback's final game. Manning declined to confirm that comment last week.\n\n\"What happened to private conversations on the 50-yard line?\" he said. \"They don't exist anymore.\"\n\nEveryone expects this to be Manning's last game. He's not the player he once was, but he has the Panthers' respect.\n\nAZCENTRAL\n\n2016 NFL mock draft: McManaman's first edition\n\nPanthers cornerback Josh Norman grew up idolizing Manning, which Norman's friends have reminded him of.\n\n\"That's PM,\" Norman said last week. \"That's P freaking M, the guy you've been idolizing.\"\n\nCam Newton's likeability factor.\n\nWord is a lot of folks don't like the Panthers quarterback. Maybe it's because of the way he celebrates during games. Maybe it's because some aren't sure how to take a talented African American quarterback, as Newton mentioned this week.\n\nOr maybe it's because Newton is not the starting quarterback of their favorite team.\n\nNewton is sure to be asked about the subject this week, and here's hoping he dips into his deep bag of metaphors for an explanation.\n\nAfter the victory over the Cardinals, Newton compared the \"process\" of building a winner to cooking collard greens.\n\n\"It wasn't going to be instant grits,\" he said. \"It was going to be like long, slow-cooked collard greens. I think those collard greens are brewing right now. You can smell them from 100 miles away.\"\n\nThomas Davis' right forearm.\n\nThe Panthers linebacker suffered a broken bone in his right forearm in the victory over the Cardinals. He underwent surgery on Monday to insert a plate that is held in place with about a dozen screws.\n\nDavis insists he's playing in Super Bowl 50. Coach Ron Rivera is taking a wait-and-see attitude.\n\nBut no one will be surprised if Davis plays. He has suffered three torn ACLs in his career and is the emotional leader of the Panthers' defense.\n\n\"If I had a concern about hitting somebody or getting hit, I wouldn't even take the field,\" he said last week.\n\nCan the Broncos' defense be blocked?\n\nThe Patriots couldn't do it in the AFC title game, and quarterback Tom Brady took a beating.\n\nVon Miller and DeMarcus Ware are blurry fast off the edge, especially in noisy stadiums against quarterbacks who don't hard count or vary cadence much.\n\nIf anyone can devise something to control Cam and company, it's Broncos coordinator Wade Phillips, son of Bum, and a bit of a wizard.\n\nCan the Panthers' offense be stopped?\n\nThe Panthers led the NFL in scoring and put up 45 against the Cardinals, making a top five defense look weak and dazed.\n\nNewton makes it go, of course. He is the size of a tight end and harder to bring down.\n\nAZCENTRAL\n\nArizona Cardinals podcast: The Bird's Eye View from Kent Somers and Mike Jurecki previewing the Packers\n\nUnlike Brady, Newton can move. It's rare to see an NFL team use so many designed quarterback runs, but they are effective for the Panthers.\n\nWhat's odd is the Panthers have had no problem scoring points even though their top wide receiver is Ted Ginn Jr., who seems to drop about 20 percent of the balls thrown to him.\n\nBut Newton also has tight end Greg Olsen. Want to make Bears fans cry? Remind them their team traded Olsen to Carolina in 2011 for a third-round pick.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1WTQUAV",

                    "body": "Englewood, Colo. * Before his whirlybird spin in the air forever etched him in NFL lore, two-time Super Bowl champion John Elway called his mother on the team flight from Pittsburgh after winning the AFC championship on Jan. 11, 1998.\n\n\"I said, 'Mom, guess what? We get to go back to the Super Bowl!\" Elway recounted. \"She said, 'Do we really have to go back?\"\n\nAfter so many Super Bowl letdowns -- three losses by an average of 32 points -- she wasn't sure watching her son face the two-touchdown favorite Green Bay Packers was such a good idea.\n\nMany Denver fans are similarly pensive as these Broncos (14-4) prepare to face Cam Newton and the mighty Carolina Panthers (17-1) in Super Bowl 50 as five-point underdogs.\n\nThey swear they've learned their lessons, however, after getting shellacked by Seattle 43-8 in the Super Bowl two years ago.\n\nThey won't be beating each other up this time in full-pads practices in the lead-up to the Feb. 7 kickoff.\n\nThey're praising their opponents aplenty -- a lot like the Broncos talked up the Packers 18 years ago.\n\nThey won't be soaking in the nightlife quite so full throttle once they get to San Francisco on Sunday.\n\nThey'll certainly prepare for a loud crowd this time after former coach John Fox famously turned down the speakers at practices figuring it would be like a home game only to see that plan ripped apart in all of 12 seconds.\n\nPlayers and coaches have already taken care of tickets and flights for family and friends and all the distractions that go with the Super Bowl so when they return to work Thursday their focus is on football.\n\n\"We got spanked last time. I felt bad for a month and a-half, two months,\" said wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, the lone bright spot that night in the Meadowlands when Seattle's sideline-to-sideline supremacy rendered his Super Bowl-record 13 receptions a footnote.\n\n\"He played great,\" Elway said in the aftermath of that blowout. \"If we all played like he did, we'd have won.\"\n\nElway was asked after the last Super Bowl letdown how long it took him to get over his three Super Bowl losses.\n\n\"I'm not over them yet,\" he shot back. \"I just added this one to it.\"\n\nElway remade his team after its 35-point loss to the Seahawks. He committed $109.5 million by adding free agents DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib and T.J. Ward. The trio has helped turn Denver from an offensive juggernaut that had scored an NFL record 606 points behind Peyton Manning's record-breaking run in 2013 into a defensive team.\n\nTwo years after taking the league's No. 1 offense to the Super Bowl, the Broncos bring the NFL's No. 1 defense, one that battered Tom Brady with an incredible 23 hits Sunday.\n\nThe Broncos also changed their offensive identity this season with the hiring of coach Gary Kubiak, who installed a better ground game and a plan for Manning to share snaps with Brock Osweiler in practice.\n\nThe plan came in handy when Manning missed six weeks with a foot injury and Osweiler kept the Broncos rolling right along. And the ground game finally came on behind a new O-line in Kubiak's zone blocking scheme.",

                    "body": "Indianapolis Colts\n\nWeek 8: Carolina Panthers 29, Indianapolis Colts 26 (OT)\n\nThis was the first game that became a trend for the Panthers as they nearly blew a second half lead after holding a 23-6 lead and saw the Colts score 17 straight points, including a field goal by Adam Vinatieri as time expired.\n\nThe Colts then when on to a score a field goal on their opening drive of overtime but Graham Gano was the hero with two straight field goals, including a 52-yarder to end the game.\n\nThe Panthers had an excellent game running the ball with 140 rushing yards, with Jonathan Stewart leading the way with 82 yards and one touchdown. The defense was the story in this game as they forced a fumble and interception on the Colts' first two drives. Andrew Luck finished the game with three interceptions, one by Kurt Coleman, Charles Tillman and Luke Kuechly.\n\nWeek 9: Indianapolis Colts 27, Denver Broncos 24\n\nThe Colts jumped out to a big 17-point lead halfway through the second quarter but the Broncos were able to tie it up in the fourth quarter at 24. Adam Vinatieri was asked to make another late-game field goal and the Colts were able to hold on and beat their former franchise quarterback, Peyton Manning. The Broncos' quarterback finished the game with 281 rushing yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.\n\nThis would mark the first loss of the season for the Broncos. The offense struggled to establish the run in the game, finishing with only 35 rushing yards on the ground, due in part to falling behind early in this game. The defense meanwhile couldn't get to Andrew Luck, who was sacked only once and didn't have a single turnover.\n\nThis game was the start of a stretch where the Broncos lost four of their next seven games and this was the last regular season game that Manning played the entire game. The Broncos' quarterback would be pulled the following week for Brock Osweiler, who finished out the regular season as the starting quarterback, except for the second half of the season finale.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nWeek 8: Denver Broncos 29, Green Bay Packers 10\n\nThe Green Bay Packers started the year very well, winning their first six games, and entered Week 8 undefeated, as did the Denver Broncos. However, the Broncos didn't make it much of a game by jumping out to a 17-point lead and winning 29-10.\n\nPeyton Manning had one of his best games of the season even though he did not throw a touchdown pass. He finished with a season-high 340 passing yards, completing over 72% of his passes and was not sacked once.\n\nThe Broncos' run game was the key to the offense as Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson combined for 161 rushing yards and three touchdowns.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, the defense was able to shut down Aaron Rodgers, who only had 77 passing yards and was sacked three times. The Broncos have done an excellent job getting pressure on the quarterback from the linebacker position and this game was no different as DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller each had a sack.\n\nWeek 9: Carolina Panthers 37, Green Bay Packers 29\n\nThe Packers' quarterback had a much better game with 369 passing yards and four touchdowns, however the end result was the same as the Panthers beat the Packers 37-29. This was the second straight week that the Panthers nearly blew a big second half lead.\n\nCam Newton matched Rodgers with four touchdowns of his own (3 passing, 1 rushing) however he almost had a costly mistake at the end of the game. The Packers had just scored to cut the lead to eight points and on the first play Newton had his pass intercepted. However, Thomas Davis made the game saving play with an interception on 4th-and-Goal from the four-yard line with about two minutes left in the game.\n\nSimilar to the Broncos, the Panthers dominated on the ground with 130 rushing yards were able to put pressure on Rodgers with five sacks.\n\nTwitter @BrandonCroce.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @PanthersonScout and like our page on Facebook.",

                    "title": "Surprising NFL Playoff Results From a New England Perspective",
                    "body": "As a New Englander and a strong supporter of the Patriots, I can't help but say these playoffs went in the complete opposite direction of what I expected. Seven weeks into this season, we had four dominant undefeated teams: the Patriots, Panthers, Bengals, and Broncos, while the rest of the NFL showed major roster holes and weak results. The \"Kill-Everybody Tour\" was in full effect as the Patriots took out their anger over the deflategate fiasco and Roger Goodell on the hapless Jaguars, Colts, and others. The Broncos edged past everyone with results like 16-10 (week five against the Raiders) thanks to a dominant defense and kicking game, even with a diminished Peyton Manning. Even though the Bengals looked incredible and Andy Dalton looked more like Aaron Rodgers than Aaron Rodgers did, we all knew they would pull out a typical Bengals performance late in the season and then tank in the playoffs (Dalton broke his thumb trying to make a tackle after an interception in week 13 and the Bengals lost in embarrassing fashion to the Steelers in the first round of the playoffs). Then there was the Carolina Panthers, who had finished 7-8-1 in the previous season and only won a playoff game thanks to an Arizona scouting team offense featuring Ryan Lindley, Kerwynn Williams and their 78 total offensive yards gained.\n\nAlthough the rest of regular season brought the top teams down to earth a little bit especially in the AFC, by the time the playoffs rolled around the Patriots looked primed to roll through to the Superbowl. The two wild-card teams were more of a threat, considering they were the hottest team in football (Chiefs) and the team with Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown, and the only offense that could keep up with Brady and co. The NFC featured the always dangerous Seahawks, the luckiest 15-1 team in NFL history (at least we thought), and Carson Palmer, who in his 12 year career had zero playoff wins. All four wild-card teams won on the opening weekend to no one's surprise. Perhaps the only surprise of the divisional round was how Carolina dismantled Seattle in the first half, but other than that the top teams all moved on through competitive games. Then came the AFC Championship game, New England vs. Denver.\n\nThe Patriots were three point favorites despite playing in Denver, and 81% of the tickets and 91% of the total money was bet on the Patriots. All the pundits said that in order to pull off the miracle upset win, Manning would need to play like the Peyton of old and the defense would need to harass Brady within one second of the snap, but in all likelihood the Patriots would roll through to San Francisco. What happened?\n\nWell, basically what all the experts were saying. Von Miller and Demarcus Ware got to Brady over 20 times, and while Peyton Manning only had a few legitimate passes the whole game, those passes went for heartbreaking touchdowns. With such a strong defense, that was all they needed. Perhaps no one gave the Broncos enough credit, or maybe we all overvalued the abilities of Brady, Edelman, and Gronk to carry a team by themselves to another Super Bowl. What is clear is that the Patriots had a few major holes on the offensive line, at running back, and in some spots on the defense, while the Broncos were extremely strong, if not elite, at basically every position except quarterback. After all, the Broncos were the top seed in the AFC, so maybe their trip to the Super Bowl should not have been so surprising.\n\nIn the NFC, it seemed like all year people were waiting for the Panthers to lose. When they finally did in week 16 against the Falcons, many of wrote off their Super Bowl chances. With the dominant Cardinals, resurgent Seahawks, and Aaron Rodgers-led Packers, how could a perennial .500 hundred possible compete? They had a quarterback who was more interested in dabbing than winning, a defense without many stars, and Ron Rivera as their head coach, who before this season had a 32-31 career record. The Panthers were barely favorites in each of their playoff games, despite finishing the season 15-1. Then, all they did was dominate. The Panthers went up 31-0 in the first half against Seattle, opened the NFC Championship game as mere three point favorites and then beat the Cardinals 49-15. Newton proved his MVP talk and their defense proved to be one of the best in the league.\n\nSo here we are, with a Super Bowl matchup featuring the two most dominant teams that no one wanted. All season we saw excuses as to why they could never win in the Playoffs, and it mostly had to do with quarterback play. Peyton Manning was a shell of himself all season long. He threw nine touchdowns and 17 interceptions, one shy of league leader Blake Bortles, despite throwing 250 fewer passes. That caused us to overlook the greatness of the Denver Broncos everywhere else on the field. Everyone focused their attentions on Cam Newton too, but in a slightly different way. Although he was fabulous all season, the way he carried himself on and off the field drew negative views of him throughout the season. Even I thought Cam was wildly overrated, and just because he gave footballs to little kids it didn't make him belong in the same conversation as Tom Brady, and a lot of people felt the same way. We were wrong. Cam Newton clearly was the MVP this season, just as the Broncos defense could more than make up for its quarterback.\n\nWhy no one could figure out that the two best teams in the regular season would end up battling each other in the Super Bowl, I have no idea. Maybe we got swept up in the drama of Deflategate (imagine Goodell personally handing the Lombardi Trophy to Tom Brady after the two have sued each other in federal court). Maybe we're all ready to see the end of Manning. Perhaps not everyone is ready for the new generation of quarterbacks to take over. Whatever it was, the two top teams of the 2015 NFL season are playing in the Super Bowl, and that's how it should be. Even if no one saw it coming.\n\nShare This:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)",

                    "body": "All season, Matt Chatham has been breaking down tape for FOXSports.com's NFL Game of the Week column. Now, as we shift our focus to Super Bowl 50, he will break down four key aspects that could decide if the Panthers or Broncos emerge victorious. The first in our four-part series looked at how the Panthers' pass rush will rattle Peyton Manning. The second examined how the Broncos defense can corral and contain Cam Newton. The third looked at how the Panthers wideouts might give the Broncos secondary some issues. Today, our final installment looks at how the running games \u00e2\u0080\" not thee quarterbacks \u00e2\u0080\" could tip the scales.\n\nSo I hear the NFL is a passing league? Naw, 2015 was yet another reminder that it's still just a football league. The best two teams at playing all-around football usually advance to this stage, and this season neither of them are particularly adept at throwing the football compared to their couched NFL peers.\n\nBut here they are in Santa Clara, still playing football. Huh.\n\nIt's been a while since both Super Bowl participants were so dependent upon their running games as the first weapon in their offensive arsenal - although both of these teams run the football decidedly different ways. Style differences aside, it's a safe bet that if either of these two teams has their running games significantly stymied by the opposing defense on Sunday, we then know who the new Super Bowl champion will be.\n\nFor Carolina, they're as odd of a duck as you'll get in a present-day defensive preparation week. Oddball motions, goofy formations, stretches of plodding play followed by some of the most explosive action you'll see in today's game. They test the patience of opposing defenses and adherence to the fundamentals of run fits in a defensive front as much any offense in the league. They lull you to sleep with piles of benign three yard runs until you slip. Then they swallow half the field in a single run.\n\nBut newsflash: Cam Newton is the heart of this Panthers operation.\n\nYes, technically he's a quarterback in your game program, but he's also the best runner on the Carolina roster. He's big and fast (I'm pretty sure you've heard that by now). But what makes him particularly dangerous with the ball is his combination of decision-making in the read elements of the Panther offense, his short-area burst to out-leverage tacklers in the box, and his fall-forward tendency to finish off runs--a totally under-appreciated aspect to his game that typically accounts the for a couple extra yards on the tail end of nearly everything he does (see below). <pic 1>\n\nAs rare as true two-back offensive sets have become in the NFL, the Panthers have their own little twist. Because Cam is essentially a third potential ball carrier -- one even willing to throw from time to time -- two-back sets ostensibly have to be considered three-back sets by the defense. And because of this, typical seven- or eight-man boxes built to stop the run can still come up a gap short.\n\nRunning back James Stewart is the perfect complement to this offense because he's got deceptive quickness to the edge, good patience, solid change of direction skills, and the requisite power style that works in the tight spaces of Carolina's beefy formations (see below). <pic 2>\n\nOne of the biggest reasons you've seen such great gains in Newton's pocket passing this year is the pocket is often a very safe place for he and his cannon arm. The run success the Panthers have had keeps opposing defenses out of hard-core man-to-man concepts because defenders simply can't afford to spend much time with their back to the ball.\n\nThe glut of more basic, rules-based defensive looks also helps slow the exotic pass rush schemes another passer in the pocket might see. This offense simply isn't one you want to gamble much against. They sit and wait for the big shot play, willing to jab and jab until you're ready to be knocked out.\n\nFor the Broncos, the running game is more of a lifeline. Denver's defense has pulled them through the playoffs with outstanding performances, but the offense has been there with a handful of critical plays that the team has needed to advance. This is very much an offense that needs its running game to stay on track to help put the Panthers on their heels and out of Peyton Manning's face.\n\nSurprisingly, a very big part of the Broncos running game is their quarterback who doesn't run so well anymore. I don't mean to say Manning himself runs much with the ball, but rather he judiciously audibles and sets the point of attack in the running game to fit the defensive front's math. As a youth football coach of mine used to say, Manning is an expert at reading the box and picking the play to \"run it where they ain't\" (see below). <pic 3>\n\nBoth running backs CJ Anderson and Ronnie Hillman have had big days for this Denver offense throughout the year at different times. It's sometimes difficult to predict who'll garner more carries week to week, which is likely something Denver coach Gary Kubiak likes to keep the opposition guessing. Anderson has been the hotter hand lately, and his timely explosive runs in the Denver stretch run game have been just what this team has needed.\n\nAnderson and Stewart actually have quite similar styles, but Anderson has flashed another gear at times to get the corner or make the mundane into something special. One of the more positive areas of growth seen in Anderson late this season is penchant for working with his blockers -- playing off their leverage, helping to avoid too many negative runs (see below). <pic 4>\n\nHe plays with great leverage and explosiveness when he finds a hole, and should significantly test linebackers Luke Kuechly and patched up Thomas Davis to not overrun cuts and wrap up in their second-level tackling.\n\nMost importantly in all of this is Peyton Manning doesn't need third-and-10s. He needs third-and-3s. He can still pick you apart in the right down and distance. And getting him there sits largely on the shoulders of this Broncos running game.\n\nFootball is still a game of getting from here to there. When you throw it, there's more risk. When you don't have to, there's obviously much less. These two offenses rely heavily on the less risky proposition, and both have shown that complimentary-only passing games can still get you onto the world's biggest stage.\n\nSomebody's going to take home the prize. My guess is that somebody runs off with it.\n\nSTORIES FROM FOOTBALL BY FOOTBALL\n\nPocket Melt: Broncos Burned Patriots On the Edges\n\nVIDEO: Why the Patriots' two-point play against the Broncos failed",

                    "body": "Rich Gabrielson/Icon Sportswire Rich Gabrielson/Icon Sportswire\n\nThe Denver Broncos are authoring one of the stranger Super Bowl odysseys in recent memory.\n\nAdmit it: this didn't look like a Super Bowl team until maybe the go-ahead drive against the Steelers. For many, that championship-level value probably didn't reveal itself until Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware kept making Tom Brady miserable last week.\n\nFor weeks, this looked like a bumbling experiment with misshaped pieces despite wins piling up, and the Broncos' second-most successful -- but most dominant -- era was set for a crash-landing finish and awkward rebuild.\n\nBut Gary Kubiak ended up deftly managing this team to Super Bowl 50.\n\nThis is by far the least flashy of the Broncos' four Peyton Manning-led teams. Without Julius Thomas, Orlando Franklin and Ryan Clady, it doesn't possess the offensive talent of those high-powered rosters. Kubiak's vintage playbook, along with some injuries and front office offseason miscues, may have accelerated the Broncos' offensive regression. The numbers back that up.\n\nBut what if the veteran coach's guidance and retooling of the offense also kept a declining Manning afloat and elevated Denver to some close victories that wouldn't have occurred under John Fox?\n\nViewing this season from the prism of Kubiak's leadership -- flanked by Wade Phillips' underrated mind -- John Elway may have used good judgment when determining Fox's staff coaxed all it could during its four years. Kubiak is in command of this team, one that did not have clear leadership under Fox.\n\nJudging Kubiak's performance and role in steering the Broncos back to the Super Bowl is a multi-layered task.\n\nHe guided the Texans to the playoffs twice before the eight-year operation cratered in 2013. That sample doesn't generate much enthusiasm, and had Kubiak not been Elway's longtime backup and future offensive coordinator, he's still coaching the Ravens' offense.\n\nBut since he was, that run-dependent offense everyone thought would be ill-fitting of Manning's prodigious skill set resurfaced in Denver. And it was quite wrong for Manning, with the legend's preposterous-looking nine-touchdown pass/17-interception regular season showing it.\n\nBrock Osweiler looked like the better quarterback in this offense, which either said something incredible about the previously uninspiring career backup, signaled Manning's decline was real, or that Kubiak's offense was past its prime.\n\nLost in that zoo of ineptitude and uncertainty was Kubiak's team consistently doing enough to win. Of the Broncos' 12 regular-season triumphs, they only had two secured by the fourth quarter -- a whitewash of the Packers and a Miller- and Malik Jackson-aided win in San Diego.\n\nThe rest came in un-Bronco fashion after years of an efficient passing game dispatching foes. Denver winning so many games (11 total) by a touchdown or less makes this season look extremely fortunate or shows some decision-making and finishing skills that weren't consistently present under Fox.\n\nSure, Fox's teams dominated, going 40-13 from 2012-14. But he never lived down the reputation that he held the Broncos back. An old-school football man having final say over a team driven by a new-age offense, Fox seemed along for Manning's ride. Denver's playoff misfortune reflected this.\n\n04 October 2015: Denver Broncos Head Coach Gary Kubiak in action during a game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High in Denver, CO. (Photo by Robin Alam/Icon Sportswire)\n\nKubiak, Manning's first true offensive-oriented head coach, deciding to rest his starter in practice frequently and installing a system that limited the in-game workload of a player always burdened with team-carrying responsibility proved prescient. The Broncos advanced this far because Manning finally realized his role on this team, one that's been more Alex Smith and a lot less Peyton Manning.\n\nBut they may not be here had Kubiak not put the finishing touches on his most notable management obstacle.\n\nNot following the media's lead and naming Osweiler the permanent starter allowed time to see if Manning could heal enough to regain his job. A proclamation following the Broncos' initial defeat of the Patriots or their come-from-behind win against the Bengals would have been the wrong move. But that was hard to see in the moment, when few knew Manning's health status.\n\nThe Broncos' prolonged futility -- the second halves against the Chargers, Raiders and Steelers, and the first half vs. the Bengals -- under Osweiler made it important Kubiak kept the door open for Manning. And his pulling the trigger on the quarterback switch when the No. 1 seed appeared to be slipping away in Week 17 galvanized the team.\n\nManning no longer takes the kind of risks he did when he rocketed to the top of the interceptions-thrown list. Even amid this decline that seemed to emerge out of nowhere midway through last season, he's proven just capable enough to manage these games and let the defense secure wins.\n\nKubiak showing enough confidence in Manning's ability to make another crucial career adjustment, not unlike the one he made in 2012 by tweaking his game after the neck surgeries left him a shell of his former self, illustrated uncommon patience.\n\nThe obvious counter to this: Kubiak and Manning are the beneficiaries of a relentless defense. Phillips' revitalized unit, basically Jack Del Rio's holdovers playing better, needed to make three fourth-quarter stops inside or near its red zone to vanquish New England. If the Broncos had merely a good defense, the Steelers or Patriots are representing the AFC.\n\nA good defense probably keeps Denver out of the playoffs. Had it not bailed out the floundering offense several times early in the season, Manning's final year travels a 2010 Brett Favre-ian road and Kubiak's tenure looks shaky. Elway and Kubiak bringing in Phillips helped prevent this.\n\nKubiak's simpler attack slowed down Manning, but this methodical approach may have saved the workaholic maestro from himself. The Broncos aren't here if Manning's running his old offense. He's just not talented enough for that kind of volume anymore.\n\nOsweiler playing a key role in setting this up also put the Broncos in better position for the future.\n\nWhile lucky he inherited a defense on this level, Kubiak played a big part in this unlikely surge.\n\nWin or lose next weekend, he delivered steady leadership during an incredibly unusual season. That's a good start for the franchise's next chapter.\n\nRelated ItemsAFC TodayAFC WestDenver BroncosFeaturedNFL Today",

                    "body": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- As the Denver Broncos prepare for the franchise's eighth Super Bowl appearance, Feb. 7 against the Carolina Panthers in Santa Clara, California, it's a good time to unveil a list of the top 10 players in Broncos history. After consulting several longtime players, coaches and other team officials, there were many tough calls. Here they are:\n\n10. (tie) Cornerback Louis Wright and wide receiver Rod Smith: I cannot, and will not, leave either of these guys off the list. Plenty of folks in the NFL say Wright is deserving of a Hall of Fame spot, yet the 12-year Bronco has never even been a HOF finalist. Wright was a phenomenal player who affected how offenses played. Meanwhile, Smith retired as the franchise's all-time leading receiver, a heartbeat player in a star-studded locker room for a two-time Super Bowl winner.\n\n9. Safety Steve Atwater: A finalist for the Hall of Fame's Class of 2016, Atwater was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection when it meant a lot more than it does now in the days of declined invitations and injury replacements. Atwater played in 14 playoff games with the Broncos, and every offensive player who faced him wanted to know exactly where the hard-hitting safety was on the field.\n\n8. Linebacker/defensive end Karl Mecklenberg: Yes, he deserves a slot in Canton as well. He was a Swiss Army-type of defender who could line up anywhere for defensive coordinator Joe Collier. Mecklenberg could rush, he could cover, and Collier has said he had no concerns lining up Mecklenberg at \"seven spots in the same game.\"\n\n7. Linebacker Randy Gradishar: There may be no player who stirs the emotion of Broncos fans when the Hall of Fame is the topic of conversation more than Gradishar, who is one of several defensive giants snubbed by the Hall. Gradishar is the Broncos' all-time leader in tackles and never missed a game in his 10-year career.\n\n6. Running back Floyd Little: The Hall of Famer (Class of '10) was the franchise's first star -- the first first-round pick signed by the team in the pre-merger day of pro football. Between 1967 and 1975, only O.J. Simpson rushed for more yardage than Little. He won the NFL's rushing title in 1971. However, he never played in a postseason game because the Broncos didn't make the playoffs until 1977.\n\n5. Tight end Shannon Sharpe: The Hall of Famer (Class of '11) played on both of the Broncos' Super Bowl winners and was a four-time All-Pro selection. He played 12 of his 14 NFL seasons with the Broncos and led the team in catches for six straight seasons -- 1992-97.\n\n4. Cornerback Champ Bailey: The future Hall of Famer came to the Broncos via trade in 2004. Coach Mike Shanahan traded running back Clinton Portis to the Washington Redskins for Bailey and a second-round draft pick. Bailey went on to play 10 of his 15 career seasons in Denver, including a 10-interception season in 2005, when he should have been the league's defensive player of the year. He was a cornerstone player in a time of transition -- the Broncos' 4-12 season in 2010 certainly a low point -- but went to eight of his 12 career Pro Bowls with the Broncos.\n\n3. Quarterback Peyton Manning: If Manning calls it a career after Super Bowl 50, he will have spent four seasons with the team. Should Manning be considered a \"real\" Bronco? If a guy is a major part of two Super Bowl trips in those four seasons, has piloted the league's highest-scoring offense and helped return the franchise to the kind of prominence owner Pat Bowlen wanted the Broncos to have, then he's on the list. Manning is a Mount Rushmore player and will be in the Hall of Fame the minute the five-year waiting period ends.\n\n2. Running back Terrell Davis: Most players on the 1997 and '98 Broncos would agree they wouldn't have Super Bowl rings if it weren't for Davis. A knee injury ended his career prematurely, but he is the greatest postseason player at his position in league history -- he averaged 142.5 rushing yards per game in the playoffs -- and he was both the league MVP and Super Bowl MVP in his career. He is a Hall of Fame finalist for the Class of 2016.\n\n1. Quarterback John Elway. Hall of Famer (Class of 2004). He went to five Super Bowls as a player, won back-to-back titles in the last two seasons of his career and was named the MVP of the last game he played in -- Super Bowl XXXIII. In short, he is the most accomplished player in the franchise's history and retired as the league's winningest quarterback -- Brett Favre and Manning have since passed him. Elway also generated 83 percent of the team's points during his career.\n\nHonorable mention: Jason Elam, Simon Fletcher, Rich Jackson, Tom Jackson, Tom Nalen, Jake Plummer, Dennis Smith, Lionel Taylor, Billy Thompson, Rick Upchurch, Gary Zimmerman",

                    "body": "Phillips took over as the Denver Broncos' defensive coordinator before the start of this season. He succeeded Jack Del Rio, who had departed to become the head coach of the Oakland Raiders. Del Rio had done a solid job with the Broncos' defense. He understood how to put his players in best position to succeed and called plays that suited his available personnel. His Broncos ranked in the top five of DVOA, third against the run and fifth against the pass. Phillips inherited the stars that had established that standard, and elevated the unit as a whole to another level. During Phillips' first season, the Broncos finished as the top ranked defense by DVOA and the top ranked pass defense by a huge margin.\n\nThe difference between Del Rio and Phillips came in Phillips' ability to adjust to specific opponents. Without Phillips, the Broncos would not have been able to smother the New England Patriots' offense in the AFC Championship Game.\n\nIn that game, Tom Brady threw the ball 56 times for 310 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. On the few occasions the Patriots attempted to run the ball, they couldn't find any space. In fact, Brady himself had the longest run of the game with a rare 11-yard scramble. The Patriots ultimately scored 18 points, with one of those touchdowns coming on a short field after a turnover. In the fourth quarter, the Broncos stopped the Patriots' offense on fourth down twice before making the game-deciding stop on a two-point conversion attempt. The Broncos' offense couldn't score to secure the lead, making each of those plays decisive. Even when the Patriots scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter, they did so by taking advantage of the Broncos' injuries at both safety positions.\n\nThe critical moments of the game were mostly decided by the players involved, but the overall performance of the unit was set up by Phillips' play calling. Phillips understood how to keep the Patriots off balance. He disguised his pass rushes while not being so aggressive that he exposed his defensive backs in space. Phillips understood that the Patriots didn't want to run and that they didn't have the offensive linemen to counter the Broncos' individual pass rushers.\n\nStylistically, the Broncos defense was a perfect matchup for the Patriots offense. In the Super Bowl, that won't be the case. Not only are the Panthers a tougher matchup for the best defense in the NFL, they run a polar opposite offense in terms of style. There aren't two offenses in the NFL who are less alike than the Patriots and Panthers.\n\nWhere the Patriots center their offense around a quick, short passing game, the Panthers primarily want to run through or around you. The Panthers possess the most diverse and dangerous rushing attack in the NFL because of Jonathan Stewart and Cam Newton. Stewart has been one of the best backs in the NFL this year, while no other quarterback can offer a dimension as a ball carrier like Newton. When the Panthers look to throw the ball, they often use max protections and encourage Newton to hold onto the ball so they can throw downfield. He holds the ball so his receivers have time to come open, whereas the Patriots relied on their receivers to get open quickly so Brady could get rid of the ball.\n\nPhillips has two weeks to figure out how to stop an offense that steamrolled its two most recent opponents.\n\nPlaying a heavy dose of Cover-2 against the Panthers would only entice them to run the ball. Instead, it makes more sense for the Broncos to drop T.J. Ward into the box and show more Cover-3 looks. The Panthers stretch defenses horizontally with counter and option runs. It's easier to contain those runs when you have an eighth defender in the box. Defenses have attempted to contain the Panthers' running game by doing this all season, but player execution has let them down. Phillips doesn't have a dominant nose tackle on which he can rely, so he needs to emphasize gap integrity and stop the Panthers with leverage from his defensive line and penetration from his linebackers.\n\nEarlier this season, Dick LeBeau's Tennessee Titans defense did a good job against the Panthers' running game. The Panthers still managed to be productive on the day, but that was more about the caliber of player available to the Titans rather than LeBeau's approach.\n\nThe Panthers will pull different players across their formations to attack different points of the defense. It's clear that their most dangerous puller is right guard Trai Turner, who is having an outstanding season. He is a big body who can move and comfortably play in space. In the above play, he is going to act as Jonathan Stewart's lead blocker as he pulls away from the line of scrimmage at the snap. While Turner is departing his initial positioning, the Panthers leave the center one-on-one with the nose tackle and double both defensive ends in the Titans' 3-4 front. This leaves the outside linebackers completely unblocked for the moment.\n\nIt's impossible to know what the Panthers are going to do at this early stage in the play because Newton has so many options in this alignment. Both outside linebackers can only advance downfield with caution, while the interior linebackers wait to read the action in front of them.\n\nBoth outside linebackers put themselves in position to contain the play. Both can set the edge while the inside linebackers look to read Turner and Stewart's actions between the tackles. With Michael Griffin (33) in the box as an extra defender, the Titans' inside linebackers don't need to be overly concerned with covering a cutback. Griffin is coming from a deeper alignment, but he is close enough to meet the running back at the line of scrimmage if he redirects. Turner is going to block Brian Orakpo (98) on the edge. Stewart is expecting to run behind him, so this makes Orakpo irrelevant. Wesley Woodyard (59) who is coincidentally a former Broncos player, plays this run perfectly. He recognizes the double-team and sees Turner pulling his way. He knows he has another inside linebacker to his left and a safety outside of him, so he can attack the gap that develops in front of him.\n\nIn using a double-team to clamp down on the right defensive end, the Panthers were putting a lot of pressure on the tight end who lined up in the backfield. He is now responsible for Woodyard, but he has a lot of ground to cover to execute a successful block. He is reliant on Woodyard being hesitant because of the action around him.\n\nThe Panthers had tried to double-team Jurrell Casey (99), the Titans' best defender. Importantly, Casey doesn't get washed away by the double-team. He holds his position and is then free to work towards the running back when one of the two blockers advances downfield to pick up the other inside linebacker. At the same time, Woodyard is meeting the pulling tight end behind the line of scrimmage. The two defenders combine to shut down all of the space in front of Stewart and force him to stop his feet behind the line of scrimmage. Stewart can still create yards from this position because he is a hugely talented runner, but this is exactly where the defense wants to trap the ballcarrier.\n\nIt's not enough to get to this point in the play against the Panthers. Because they have so many options in their running game and can run from so many different looks with so many different ballcarriers, you also have to get to this point while accounting for other options. The safety and left outside linebacker have contained the cutback lane and are in position to play Newton if he had held onto the ball.\n\nUnless the Broncos can escape into an unexpected lead, Phillips' defense will be under pressure to play disciplined, physical run defense all game. He will have to commit bodies to the run even though the Panthers can beat you throwing the ball just as effectively.\n\nNewton is likely going to win the MVP award, and not just because of how he runs the ball. He has developed into a superstar quarterback who excels throwing the ball and breaking down defenses mentally. He is patient in the pocket with the ability to make subtle or decisive movements to negate pressure. It will be tougher for the Broncos to pressure Newton than it was to pressure Brady, not because Newton has a better offensive line, but because of how the Panthers scheme their protections and how Newton naturally takes away the Broncos' ability to be aggressive off the edges. Whenever the Broncos rush Newton, they need to maintain gap integrity like they would on a running play because of how dangerous a scrambler Newton is.\n\nMany defenses have relied on zone coverages behind blitzes so their defenders can keep their eyes on Newton when the play breaks down. This strategy has not worked so well over the course of the season because Newton is extremely patient and he has fast receivers who can take advantage of the free releases and space they are afforded on these types of plays. To best contain the Panthers' receivers, you need to press them at the line of scrimmage aggressively. This is dangerous, because it means cornerbacks must take their eyes away from the quarterback as well as potential running plays. Phillips is a smart defensive coordinator, though. He will understand that nothing comes without risk against this offense and he will have seen what the Panthers have done to zone coverages over recent games.\n\nAgainst the Patriots, it's best to play two deep safeties with man coverage underneath. You can make the quarterback either hold the ball or force it into tight windows while unleashing your pass rushers. Against the Panthers, you ideally want to give more help to the pass rush without creating an imbalance in your coverage. This should lead the Broncos to a five-man rush with man coverage and one deep safety behind it. In the above GIF, an example of this type of play call can be seen from the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. The Cardinals couldn't rely on this type of play because they didn't have the cornerbacks to run with the Panthers' receivers outside.\n\nAs inconsistent as the Panthers receivers can be, Ted Ginn, Corey Brown, and Devin Funchess can each consistently get open on vertical routes. Unlike the Cardinals or even the Seattle Seahawks, the Broncos have two boundary cornerbacks who can run with the Panthers' receivers. Both Bradley Roby and Aqib Talib should be able to play effective press coverage against whomever the Panthers send outside.\n\nWhen relying on man coverage against the Panthers, it's imperative that your pass rush is disciplined to keep Newton in the pocket. It's inevitable that the quarterback's athleticism will have an impact on the game, but the key is to limit that impact. The above GIF is a different angle of the same play from Sunday. The Cardinals are aggressive in pursuit of the quarterback, and they use stunts to attack the protection, yet they still contain Newton. This is where the design of the rush is important, as well as the numbers sent. Newton doesn't have anywhere to go because the pressure is consistent from every angle.\n\nThe Broncos showed last week that they can penetrate the pocket from any gap, but they have to be more consistent and disciplined in their rush if they are to do to Newton what they did to Brady.\n\nRegardless of how the Super Bowl goes, Wade Phillips has already reiterated his quality as a defensive coordinator. It's that quality that made it so surprising that he was unemployed in 2014. Phillips had previously inherited one of the worst defenses in the NFL, that of the 2010 Houston Texans, and turned it into a unit that ranked sixth, fourth, and 18th in DVOA over his three seasons with the franchise. Even though the unit dropped off in his third season, it didn't make much sense that Phillips wasn't working somewhere. Phillips himself took a moment to remind everyone of his year out after beating the Patriots this week:",

                    "body": "The year was 2007. My beloved Broncos had failed miserably in their bid for a playoff berth, but I still found a football angle for my column preceding Super Bowl XLI.\n\nThat column proved prophetic because I picked Peyton Manning to win his first Super Bowl. Nine years later he's once again defeated Tom Brady in the AFC Championship to get back to the Super Bowl -- this time as a Bronco.\n\nI had really begun to admire Peyton Manning's style and leadership pretty early in his career and by 2007 I was really hoping he would finally get his win in the \"Big Game.\" I wasn't surprised when he finally got that monkey off his back considering his pedigree and work ethic. I may have been able to make that prediction but I could have never dreamed that he would be going for his second Super Bowl win at age 38 in Super Bowl 50.\n\nIn that 2007 column, I compared the similarities between the careers of Peyton and Broncos Hall of Fame Quarterback John Elway. Late in each passer's career they were still tagged with \"not being able to win the big game.\" Ironic that the two -- Elway, nicknamed \"The Duke\" and Manning, nicknamed \"The Sheriff\" -- would get together to get back to the \"big game\" in the twilight of Manning's career.\n\nThose folks who say you can never go back and relive your glory days aren't looking too closely at this Broncos team. Who knew that 18 years after \"The Duke\" apparently rode off into the Denver sunset after a Super Bowl victory that he would be controlling the team that No. 18 \"The Sheriff\" had poised to repeat Denver history with an aging quarterback.\n\nHow could we ever have guessed that the coach of that team would be Elway's former backup Gary Kubiak. Even wilder still to the imagination, how would \"Son of Bum\" Wade Phillips ever be allowed back inside Mile High. Yet there they are, Kubiak brilliant in his first year back on the Broncos' sideline and Phillips pulling the strings on the league's best defense.\n\nSo, next week the Broncos will face the Carolina Panthers in what may well be \"The Sheriff's\" final showdown against the brash, young upstart Cam Newton, known as \"Superman.\"\n\nMy team's going in as an underdog against a team that has laid waste to nearly every opponent. Their NFC Championship match up against the Arizona Cardinals turned out to be the biggest championship blowout I've seen in a long time. But I'm not so sure Manning's age and wisdom won't win out over youth and reckless enthusiasm.\n\nIn a Jim Croce song popular long before even Elway came to Mile High, the underdog in the song is advised \"not to tug on Superman's cape.\" I think the plan from the wily veterans on my team will be to let Superman flutter around in his cape all week long then have our pass rushers grab that thing and rip it off him so quick he never knew what happened.\n\nIf we win, you likely haven't heard the last from me on this subject.",

                    "title": "Broncos' pithy motto explains best counter to Panthers' stars",
                    "body": "There is a motto -- both written and unwritten -- that has fueled the Broncos all the way to Super Bowl 50.\n\n\"If you play for the person next to you more than you play for yourself, the outcome is greater.''\n\nThis has been a powerful message Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak has delivered to his players. They have taken it to heart, and it has manifested itself on the field.\n\nMany coaches utilize these buzzword phrases as subliminal motivation to their players. Bill Parcells used to have them painted all over the Giants' training facility like subway graffiti in the bowels of the old Giants Stadium.\n\nLike Parcells did before him, Tom Coughlin had them on walls in strategic places, inside and outside the locker room, the weight room and meeting rooms.\n\nThe central theme to these sayings and mottos always is centered on team goals outweighing personal accolades.\n\nThe team the Broncos will bring to Santa Clara, Calif., next week will be a team in the truest essence of the word. They are not carried by one or two stars the way their Super Bowl counterparts, the Panthers, are by quarterback Cam Newton on offense and linebacker Luke Kuechly on defense.\n\nDo the Broncos have star players on their roster? Sure they do. Quarterback Peyton Manning is one of the league's biggest stars. Linebackers Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware are stars.\n\nBut Manning has become a complementary piece to the Denver offense, not its end-all, which had been the case the three years up until this season. The Broncos, too, have played -- and won -- without Ware this season.\n\nThis is in no way suggesting the Panthers are not a team that has used all of its players to get to the Super Bowl, going 17-1 along the way.\n\nBut unlike Carolina, there is not a single player you can take off the Denver roster a week from Sunday and think they cannot overcome the loss. The Broncos, for example, went 5-2 with backup quarterback Brock Osweiler playing when Manning was injured with a torn plantar fascia in his left foot.\n\nTake Newton away from the Panthers and it's difficult to imagine they can overcome the loss of the unquestioned league MVP this season.\n\nNewton, after all, accounted for 45 of the Panthers' 54 offensive touchdowns and 5,473 of their 7,155 total yards this season -- a remarkable percentage no other player in the NFL comes close to matching.\n\nIn remarkable contrast, the Broncos scored a total of 32 offensive TDs this season -- 13 fewer than Newton accounted for -- and 23 fewer than they scored a year ago.\n\nOsweiler, who is not even expected to play in the Super Bowl, accounted for the most Denver TDs with his 10 scoring passes. Manning had nine TD passes. Running back Ronnie Hillman had seven rushing TDs and receivers Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders each had six TD receptions.\n\nThe Broncos are 11-3 in games decided by seven points or fewer this season. Their wins have come by an average of just 6.92 points. This is the sign of a team whose players have a trust in one another under pressure. By contrast, Carolina's average margin of victory is 13.41 points.\n\nStatistics aside, the Broncos have been riding a synergy through this postseason that has been about winning a championship for the elder statesmen on the team -- specifically Manning, who's probably playing for the last time, and Ware, who's in the Super Bowl for the first time in his otherwise-decorated 11-year career.\n\nIt was, of course, Ware whom Kubiak called upon to speak to the team the night before the AFC Championship win over the Patriots, and he mesmerized his teammates with an impassioned speech while breaking out the first Lombardi Trophy the Broncos won as a visual aid.\n\nSome players said they wanted to sprint straight from the team hotel to the stadium that night for the game, Ware's words had them so amped.\n\nThe Broncos truly have lived by those words Kubiak delivered before the AFC Championship.\n\n\"If you play for the person next to you more than you play for yourself, the outcome is greater.''\n\n\"Getting Peyton another Super Bowl ring and DeMarcus his first is huge,'' running back C.J. Anderson said. \"At the end of the day, that's who you play for. You play for your teammates.''",

                    "body": "Kiz: All of Broncos Country wants a fairly-tale ending for quarterback Peyton Manning in the Super Bowl. But the rest of America isn't buying it. In fact, with more than 80 percent of the early money wagered being placed on Carolina, the line has moved to favor the Panthers by six points. If the line holds, it would make Denver the biggest underdog in the Super Bowl since the 2008 NFL season. Is this a mismatch?\n\nRenck: The Panthers deserve to be favored. They are 17-1, and if they hadn't taken an in-game selfie team photo during a 38-0 win over Atlanta, which motivated the Falcons for the rematch two weeks later, they would be undefeated. As someone who has lived nearly my entire life in Colorado, I understand why Broncos fans break out in hives over Super Bowls. The games have not been kind to the team. But this year's Denver defense will keep a win within reach as long as the offense doesn't create short fields with turnovers. Denver's only double-figure loss this season -- 29-13 to Kansas City -- came on a day when Manning threw four interceptions and was benched.\n\nKiz: The betting public can't see past the glitz of Carolina's 17-1 record and the glamour of quarterback Cam Newton, the Panthers' rising star. But the underdog in the Super Bowl has hoisted the Vince Lombardi Trophy in five of the past eight seasons, dating to the New York Giants' stunning upset of the undefeated New England Patriots. The Panthers deserve to be favored, but the legitimate difference in these teams seems to be more like a field goal rather than a touchdown.\n\nRenck: I agree. Six points is a reaction to Carolina's playoff demolition of Seattle (in the first half) and Arizona (full game). The Broncos excel at winning ugly. They want to soak up the clock, run the ball just enough to make their fans go mad, and terrorize opponents with a pressure defense. The Super Bowl sets up as a close game because every game the Broncos play is close. They have won 11 games decided by seven points or fewer, an NFL record.\n\nKiz: Here is what gives me hope for the Broncos: No other NFL team has won more big games this season than Denver, and that includes Carolina. The Broncos defeated seven teams that had a winning record. Carolina? Four. And the role of underdog fits extremely well with Denver's defensive players, a feisty bunch that doesn't care what anybody thinks. In Super Bowl XXXII, the Broncos were 11-point underdogs to Green Bay. How did that turn out?\n\nRenck: Playing with a chip on its shoulder empowers a team in ways that become almost comical. The Broncos don't need to create an enemy. That exists in a gift-wrapped box with Carolina the overwhelming favorite. Combine that slight with the Denver defense's personality and the confidence and trust in the coaches' game plan, and it makes the Broncos very dangerous. The Broncos can win this Super Bowl. Just as they have won their past four games. Keep the score in the 20s, score late and let the defense make one last stand.",

                    "body": "Kiz: All of Broncos Country wants a fairly-tale ending for quarterback Peyton Manning in the Super Bowl. But the rest of America isn't buying it. In fact, with more than 80 percent of the early money wagered being placed on Carolina, the line has moved to favor the Panthers by six points. If the line holds, it would make Denver the biggest underdog in the Super Bowl since the 2008 NFL season. Is this a mismatch?\n\nRenck: The Panthers deserve to be favored. They are 17-1, and if they hadn't taken an in-game selfie team photo during a 38-0 win over Atlanta, which motivated the Falcons for the rematch two weeks later, they would be undefeated. As someone who has lived nearly my entire life in Colorado, I understand why Broncos fans break out in hives over Super Bowls. The games have not been kind to the team. But this year's Denver defense will keep a win within reach as long as the offense doesn't create short fields with turnovers. Denver's only double-figure loss this season -- 29-13 to Kansas City -- came on a day when Manning threw four interceptions and was benched.\n\nKiz: The betting public can't see past the glitz of Carolina's 17-1 record and the glamour of quarterback Cam Newton, the Panthers' rising star. But the underdog in the Super Bowl has hoisted the Vince Lombardi Trophy in five of the past eight seasons, dating to the New York Giants' stunning upset of the undefeated New England Patriots. The Panthers deserve to be favored, but the legitimate difference in these teams seems to be more like a field goal rather than a touchdown.\n\nRenck: I agree. Six points is a reaction to Carolina's playoff demolition of Seattle (in the first half) and Arizona (full game). The Broncos excel at winning ugly. They want to soak up the clock, run the ball just enough to make their fans go mad, and terrorize opponents with a pressure defense. The Super Bowl sets up as a close game because every game the Broncos play is close. They have won 11 games decided by seven points or fewer, an NFL record.\n\nKiz: Here is what gives me hope for the Broncos: No other NFL team has won more big games this season than Denver, and that includes Carolina. The Broncos defeated seven teams that had a winning record. Carolina? Four. And the role of underdog fits extremely well with Denver's defensive players, a feisty bunch that doesn't care what anybody thinks. In Super Bowl XXXII, the Broncos were 11-point underdogs to Green Bay. How did that turn out?\n\nRenck: Playing with a chip on its shoulder empowers a team in ways that become almost comical. The Broncos don't need to create an enemy. That exists in a gift-wrapped box with Carolina the overwhelming favorite. Combine that slight with the Denver defense's personality and the confidence and trust in the coaches' game plan, and it makes the Broncos very dangerous. The Broncos can win this Super Bowl. Just as they have won their past four games. Keep the score in the 20s, score late and let the defense make one last stand.",

                    "title": "Ranking the 10 Most Important Players for Denver in the Super Bowl",
                    "body": "When the Denver Broncos take the field next Sunday, Feb. 7, for Super Bowl 50, it could be the final game for both quarterback Peyton Manning and outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware. In order for these two NFL legends to leave the game as Super Bowl champions, Denver will need a complete-team effort.\n\nBoth Manning and Ware are obvious candidates for the top spot of this list. But Von Miller, Aqib Talib and Derek Wolfe are in the running as well, as are less heralded players like Evan Mathis and C.J. Anderson. After all, this list consists of the most important Broncos players for the Super Bowl, not the most talented ones.\n\nIn this list, \"importance\" is defined as the ability a given Denver player has to thwart the Carolina Panthers' game plan on both sides of the ball, while simultaneously imposing the Broncos' game plan on the Panthers. Consider this list a guide on which players will make or break Denver's Super Bowl hopes.\n\nThese players barely missed the cut, although they will still have a substantial impact on the outcome of Super Bowl 50:\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nWR Demaryius Thomas\n\nCB Bradley Roby\n\nFS Darian Stewart\n\nDT Malik Jackson\n\nRG Louis Vasquez\n\nT.J. Ward is the first of a handful of Broncos defensive backs you'll see on this list. His versatility gives him the edge over fellow safety Darian Stewart.\n\nWard is known to be a physical safety with a penchant for both getting after the quarterback and stuffing the run. Against Carolina, both are desperately needed to set the tone of the game.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Ward's two sacks and eight quarterback pressures in the regular season ranked fifth among eligible NFL safeties.\n\nWard's biggest obstacle will be his health. He missed four games in the regular season due to an ankle injury and re-aggravated the injury during last week's AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots.\n\nPer NFL.com's Ian Rapoport, a source said Ward he will be \"good to go\" for Super Bowl 50, which is certainly beneficial to the Broncos. Even so, Ward will have to be at the top of his game to deal with the speedy Carolina wide receivers.\n\nIf you can't understand why Sanders is on this list, I have one simple question for you: Who will cover him?\n\nAssuming Panthers All-Pro cornerback Josh Norman matches up with Demaryius Thomas, an unproven Carolina defensive back will cover Sanders.\n\nTwo of the Panthers' regular-season starting cornerbacks -- Bene Benwikere and Charles Tillman -- are on season-ending injured reserve. That leaves two midseason acquisitions to potentially cover Sanders: Cortland Finnegan (signed on Nov. 30) and Robert McClain (signed on Dec. 15).\n\nBoth Finnegan and McClain were once respected NFL corners, but both appear to be on the downside of their careers. Sanders will have to beat them regularly to give Manning a reliable passing target. If Sanders can keep making timely plays like this one, it sure looks like he's poised for a big game.\n\nFor someone who can barely brush his teeth, Chris Harris Jr. sure did a great job of covering one of the NFL's best route-runners in last Sunday's AFC Championship Game.\n\nHarris' shoulder issues were a major concern heading into the game, but he overcame them to help limit Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman to a meager 53 receiving yards.\n\nHarris will be asked to do a little bit of everything in the Super Bowl, from shadowing speedy Carolina wide receivers Ted Ginn Jr. and Corey Brown to lining up against Pro Bowl tight end Greg Olsen, who is Cam Newton's go-to target.\n\nIn order to effectively play such a major role, his shoulder needs to make some significant healing progress before next Sunday.\n\nEvan Mathis gets the nod at this spot over Sanders and Harris Jr. for one reason: Denver's run game is the most pivotal focus for the offense, and he is the most likely candidate to open up the run game.\n\nMathis has always been highly regarded as an elite run-blocker, and that notion stayed true this season. He finished as second runner-up (third place) for Pro Football Focus's 2015 John Hannah Award, which is given to the NFL's best run-blocker.\n\nIdeally, Denver's passing game would be able to open up and take some pressure off the run game. But in order for that to happen, Carolina's defense needs to focus on the run game enough to give Manning more favorable coverages on his receivers.\n\nGoing up against a stout Panthers defensive line that includes Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short, Mathis simply must free up running lanes for C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman.\n\nIf this is, in fact, DeMarcus Ware's final NFL game, he'll need to make his last game one of his best ones.\n\nFor the record, I don't think the 33-year-old Pro Bowler will retire after the Super Bowl, regardless of the outcome -- although I do think a win would make him more likely to retire.\n\nDenver's pass-rushing quartet of Ware, Von Miller, Malik Jackson and Derek Wolfe combined for 29 of the team's league-best 52 regular-season sacks. Ware himself racked up 7.5 sacks -- second on the team behind Miller's 11 sacks.\n\nWare will primarily face Carolina left tackle Michael Oher, who is having a very good year. However, if he can get consistent pressure on Newton -- or at least draw some holding penalties on Oher -- Denver's pass rush may be able to take over the game, like they did against the Patriots.\n\nWhile Denver's pass rush includes some of the team's most prolific playmakers, the secondary needs to blanket the Carolina receivers long enough to give the rushers time to make plays. No Broncos defensive back gives them more of an opportunity to do so than Aqib Talib.\n\nThere is a solid argument that Chris Harris Jr. is the best Denver defensive back, but even so, he is only deserving of the title when healthy. For Super Bowl 50, give me the (relatively) healthy Talib over the ailing Harris.\n\nOne of the toughest things about having to scheme for a team like the Panthers is that they have no true go-to target outside of Greg Olsen. Much like Harris, Talib will likely cover both Ted Ginn Jr. and Corey Brown at various points in the game.\n\nPro Football Focus noted Talib has the fifth-best quarterback rating (QBR) allowed when targeted, at a mere 59.7 QBR. A similar performance could force Newton to target other receivers more often than he would like to.\n\nDerek Wolfe and Malik Jackson have anchored Denver's defensive line and given edge-rushers like Ware and Miller better pass-rushing opportunities. Between Wolfe and Jackson, however, Wolfe will have the bigger impact on the Super Bowl.\n\nAfter receiving a well-deserved four-year, $36.7 million contract extension back on Jan. 15, Wolfe has kept up his stellar performance in the playoffs. In the Broncos' two playoff games, he has notched a sack in each game, in addition to seven total tackles.\n\nWolfe's biggest tasks will be snuffing out the Panthers' run game and preventing Newton from getting outside the pocket. If he can effectively do those two things, then he won't need to notch any more sacks this postseason.\n\nYes, Denver has many defensive stars with invaluable importance to the Broncos' Super Bowl chances. But if C.J. Anderson can't get going on the ground, then the Broncos defense might as well be nonexistent.\n\nThe fact Denver's run game encompasses such a large part of their offense is why Anderson is ranked ahead of defensive Pro Bowlers like Ware, Talib, and Harris.\n\nEven more importantly, Anderson has been a more efficient running back throughout the postseason than Ronnie Hillman. Though Anderson's 31 playoff carries is only slightly ahead of Hillman's 27, his 4.6 yards per carry average is more than twice as much as Hillman's 2.0 yards per carry.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Hillman can eat up some of Anderson's carries if need be, but in order to pick up first downs on the ground against the Panthers, the more effective Anderson will need to continue his strong postseason performance.\n\nC.J. Anderson is the most crucial piece in Denver's run game. But no one is more important to Denver's overall offense than Peyton Manning.\n\nManning has to be tired of the negativity that he has received this year. From his dismal regular-season numbers, to the HGH allegations, to the \"game manager\" comments, there is no shortage of insults being hurled at Manning.\n\nYet here he stands -- one win away from his second Lombardi Trophy.\n\nManning's throwing abilities have greatly regressed since the prime of his career. But his football IQ -- including his superior knowledge of Denver's playbook and ability to read defensive coverages perfectly -- has not.\n\nDenver's offensive philosophy for the Super Bowl should be the same as every other game this season: open up the run game, don't turn the ball over and make the safe throws Carolina's defense allows.\n\nIf Manning can contribute his part to that game plan, you have to feel good about Denver's Super Bowl chances.\n\nAqib Talib leads the defensive backs, C.J. Anderson leads the Denver run game and Peyton Manning leads Denver's offense.\n\nBut Von Miller leads the team, and in turn is the Broncos' most important player in Super Bowl 50.\n\nIf you don't understand why Miller holds the top spot on this list, please take a look at what he has accomplished this season, particularly in the postseason. Look at what he did to Tom Brady -- one of the best quarterbacks to ever play the game, if not the best -- in the AFC Championship Game.\n\nThe first team All-Pro member notched 2.5 sacks and an interception off Brady, backing up his brash comments before the game. A similar performance in the Super Bowl should all but guarantee the soon-to-be free agent the ludicrous contract he is apparently asking for.\n\nEven more importantly, such a performance could very well land the Broncos their long-awaited third Lombardi Trophy.",

                    "body": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- None other than one Peyton Manning has said the Denver Broncos find themselves in Super Bowl 50 because of the team's defense.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the Broncos' offense doesn't have a very specific, very important job in the title game to give the team the best chance at the franchise's third Lombardi Trophy -- and that is to start off fast. Because these Carolina Panthers aren't known for showing up to a football party fashionably late.\n\n\"You see a lot,\" Manning said of what the game video has shown. \"You see just a fast, physical football team that's created a lot of negative plays for offenses. They've created a lot of turnovers, given an offense a lot of short fields, which as you watch the game unfold, and you see the scoreboard, it's 7-0, it's 14-0. It's like the guy singing the national anthem is still on the field and the game hasn't started yet.\"\n\nThe Panthers led the Seattle Seahawks in their NFC divisional game 14-0 at the end of the first quarter, and 31-0 at halftime. Against the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, the Panthers led 17-0 at the end of the first quarter, and 24-7 at halftime.\n\nIn the regular season, the Panthers led the Houston Texans 10-3 at the end of the first quarter in Week 2, led 10-0 at the end of the first quarter against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 4 and led 10-0 at the end of first quarter Week 12 against the Dallas Cowboys. That's to go with a 27-7 halftime lead over the Green Bay Packers in Week 9, a 21-7 halftime lead over the New York Giants in Week 15 and a 24-3 lead over the Buccaneers in the regular-season finale.\n\n\"They've jumped out on a lot of teams this year, they've played ahead,\" said Broncos coach Gary Kubiak. \"...They've played very well early ... they've got off to some fast starts.\"\n\nAnd the fast start hasn't really been a part of the Broncos' history on offense this season. The Broncos won 11 games by seven or fewer points -- they were 11-3 in those games -- and were the first team in league history to overcome three 14-0 deficits to come back and win games against teams that made the playoffs.\n\nOverall, though, the Broncos' offense put up a middle-of-the-road 67 points in the first quarter and only had two games -- Dec. 6 against San Diego and Dec. 20 against Pittsburgh -- when they scored more than a touchdown in the opening quarter. They scored 14 first-quarter points in both of those games.\n\n\"We want to do our part on offense to help our team win,\" Manning said. \"Like I've said from the get-go, our defense has gotten us to this point. Let's make that very clear. But we want to do our part and contribute ... we certainly want to try to carry our weight and not take our defense for granted.\"\n\nThe Broncos' defense finished the regular season No. 1 in total defense, No. 1 in pass defense and No. 1 in sacks, and the unit has also been one of the league's best in the first quarter. The Broncos did not surrender a first-quarter point until a Week 9 loss in Indianapolis in early November, and they surrendered just 41 opening-quarter points all season.\n\nOnly five teams surrendered fewer first-quarter points than the Broncos did, with the New York Jets having been the stingiest in the first quarter this past season.\n\n\"We pride ourselves in coming out ready to play,\" said cornerback Chris Harris Jr. \"You don't want to put your team in a bad place because you didn't open the game right.\"\n\nThe last time the Broncos played in the Super Bowl, the offense's start certainly reflected how the remainder of the game went. On the Broncos' first play from scrimmage in Super Bowl XLVIII, Manny Ramirez' snap sailed past Manning for a Seattle Seahawks safety.\n\nManning had an interception returned for a touchdown in the second quarter and the Seahawks returned the kickoff to open the third quarter for a touchdown as the Broncos rushed for 27 yards overall in what became a 43-8 Broncos loss.\n\n\"That was two years ago,\" said Broncos running back C.J. Anderson. \" ... We've got another opportunity coming up on Feb. 7 and we're just going to try to take advantage of it. ... (The Panthers' defense) is really good. They're fast, they're physical and they're strong. ... We've got to come out and have our A-game. If we don't have our A-game, it could be a long game for us.\"",

                    "body": "All season Matt Chatham has been breaking down tape for FOXSports.com's NFL Game of the Week column. Now, as we shift our focus to Super Bowl 50, he will break down four key aspects that could decide if the Panthers or Broncos emerge victorious. The first in our four-part series looked at how the Panthers' pass rush will rattle Peyton Manning. The second examined how the Broncos defense can corral and contain Cam Newton. Today, we look at how the Panthers wideout might give the Broncos secondary some issues.\n\nI'm sure the Carolina Panthers wide receivers have heard it a number of ways and a countless number of times. The Panthers receivers are nothing more than supporting actors in the Cam Newton Show or something. The story is well-worn.\n\nRising-star WR Kelvin Benjamin tore his ACL in training camp leaving Carolina without any hope through the air. They run the ball really well. Newton loves to throw to his stud tight end, Greg Olsen. Occasionally veteran fast-guy Ted Ginn catches a go-route. And that's about it.\n\nYes, the offense is highly dependent on Newton and the run game, and a tight end is actually their top wide receiving threat. But that doesn't mean the rest of the receiving crew isn't just the right complimentary pieces for the particular offense they're in.\n\nThe Broncos have plenty of All-Stars on their back end, including cornerbacks Aqib Talib, Chris Harris Jr. and Bradley Roby, as well as big hitter T.J. Ward at strong safety. As far as overall secondary talent, this is one of the better collections in the NFL. But in facing another one of those top-talent secondaries a week ago in the Arizona Cardinals, who featured Patrick Peterson, the Panthers went for over 300 yards and two touchdowns through the air on the way to a 49-15 victory.\n\nIf that doesn't make football sense, it's okay. It shouldn't.\n\nNo, this group of Panthers receivers wouldn't likely have the success they've had this season in a more traditional NFL offense. But as their run game pounds away, this group provides just the right dose of big-play ability to take advantage of all the concern given to Newton and the run game.\n\nOlsen is the master of the seam area on the football field. He'll line up all over the formation and is a willing blocker in the run game, but his times of biggest impact are when he stretches the middle lanes. The example below is a classic Olsen route, a wide release from the line of scrimmage to toy with the leverage of the safety covering him, only to return back down the hashes for a big play.\n\nOlsen is a serious concern all over the field, but the times where he'll warrant the most coverage attention by Denver is when he's working the intermediate-to-deep middle parts of the field. Fall asleep on him there and you're virtually guaranteed Newton will be working the ball his way for a big try.\n\nIn the true receiver group, Ted Ginn's 10-touchdowns are about the same as the number he'd accumulated over that past eight years in the league. Ginn was always considered an excellent returner, but his receiving history was a mixed bag. He was a speed and run-after-the-catch guy, but never a catch gobbler.\n\nBut that's why he's such a perfect fit for in Carolina. A typical day for him amounts to a few catches, one of which is usually a big, game-changing play. Last week, Ginn ran a reverse for a touchdown that was emblematic of his elite return skills, the kind of play that keeps a defense honest and not just lagging off him to prevent shot plays.\n\nThe following example shows how the Panthers are able to take advantage of the grace given Ginn, this time by way of a deep comeback completion against one of the best cornerbacks in football. The cornerback stays on top of the route throughout, guarding first for the deep route that dominates Ginn's reputation.\n\nCorey \"Philly\" Brown had a monster 86-yard touchdown in that NFC Championship game in typical Panther fashion, making one guy miss in the extreme open space and then running the rest of the length of the field. Jericho Cotchery, the savvy veteran, is always good for a handful of important sticks conversions throughout the game, and talented rookie project Devin Funchess will also show up from time to time.\n\nPocket Melt: Broncos Burned Patriots On the Edges\n\nVIDEO: Why the Patriots' two-point play against the Broncos failed",
