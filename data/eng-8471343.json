On Monday the world will receive the latest United Nations climate report. And it's a big one.\n\nHundreds of scientists, forming what's known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have been working hard behind the scenes. They've produced a series of reports in the latest round, which began in 2015. But on Monday it all comes together in what's called the Synthesis Report.\n\nIt will explain how greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet, then delve into the consequences. There's a focus on where we are most vulnerable, as well as efforts to adapt. And then, how we're acting to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.\n\nGathering all the evidence, from every corner of the globe, is an enormous undertaking, let alone reviewing the science to achieve consensus. It's a process that has been repeated several times since it began, more than three decades ago.\n\nThis is the sixth round of reports. And it won't be the last. But this is a crucial moment, because the chance to limit warming and avert dangerous climate change is slipping away.\n\nRead more:\n\n6 reasons 2023 could be a very good year for climate action\n\nThe IPCC is comprised of 195 member countries charged with producing comprehensive and objective assessments of the scientific evidence for climate change.\n\nThe World Economic Forum ranks climate action failure as the number-one risk on a global scale over the next decade. And several other top-ten global risks - extreme weather, biodiversity loss, human environment damage and natural resource crises - are made worse by climate change.\n\nGovernments, industries and communities are becoming increasingly aware of the need to tackle climate change, especially as predictions become reality.\n\nThe scientific effort to understand the causes, effects and solutions is vast and growing. Every year tens of thousands of new peer-reviewed scientific studies on climate change are published. There has to be a way to identify key messages across this enormous body of scientific evidence, and use this information to make better decisions. This is what IPCC reports do.\n\nThe IPCC process also provides a framework for the scientific community to organise and coordinate their efforts. Each reporting cycle is matched with an international scientific effort, where standardised experiments are run to test the reliability of current climate models.\n\nThe experiments include multiple possible scenarios for how atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations could change in the future, depending on choices made today. The range of results produced by different models across these sets of experiments helps to determine how confident we are in the climate change impacts expected in the future.\n\nA key aspect of IPCC reports is that they are co-produced between scientists and governments. The summary of each report is negotiated and approved line by line, with consensus from all of the IPCC member governments. This process ensures the reports remain true to the underlying scientific evidence, but also pull out the key information governments need.\n\nThe Synthesis Report will draw on all six reports released in the current cycle.\n\nIt includes three so-called \"working group reports\":\n\nIn addition, three special reports cut across these working groups and tackled focused topics, where governments requested rapid assessments to aid in their decision making:\n\nThe headline statements from this cycle of IPCC reports have been clearer than ever. They leave absolutely no room for disputing human-caused warming and the need for urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, this decade. We can expect similarly strong and clear headlines from Monday's report.\n\nLooking back over IPCC reports from the past 33 years demonstrates how our understanding of climate change has improved. The first report in 1990 stated: \"the unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect from observations is not likely for more than a decade\". Fast forward to 2021 and the equivalent assessment now states: \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land\".\n\nIn some cases, the pace of change has dramatically exceeded expectations. In 1990 West Antarctica was a region of concern but not expected to lose major amounts of ice in the next century. But by 2019 our observations show glaciers in West Antarctica retreating rapidly. This has contributed to an accelerating rise in global sea level.\n\nThere are also emerging concerns for the stability of parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet once thought to be protected from human-caused climate warming.\n\nThis demonstrates the tendency for IPCC assessments to understate the scientific evidence. Climate science is often accused of being alarmist - particularly by those trying to delay climate change action - but in fact the opposite is true.\n\nThe production of IPCC reports by consensus with governments means that statements that appear in the report summaries are justified by multiple lines of scientific evidence. This can lag behind current climate science discoveries.\n\nRead more:\n\nFriday essay: 'I feel my heart breaking today' - a climate scientist's path through grief towards hope\n\nPlans are already underway for the next assessment cycle of the IPCC, which is to begin in July this year. It's hoped the next round of reports will be produced in time to inform the Global Stocktake in 2028, where progress towards the Paris Agreement will be assessed.\n\nThe current (sixth assessment) cycle has been gruelling. Scientists have stepped up their commitment to work with governments to provide the clear and robust information required.\n\nWriting and approving reports amid a global pandemic added to the challenges. So too did the inclusion of three special reports in addition to the usual three working group reports.\n\nThe evidence for human-caused climate change is now unequivocal. This has prompted calls for future IPCC reports to more efficiently assess rapidly changing areas of science and cut across the working groups. This would bring together assessments of the causes, impacts and solutions for key aspects of climate change in one report, rather than always separating them into individual working group reports.\n\nThe establishment of the IPCC signalled climate change was an important global problem. Despite this recognition more than three decades ago, and the increasingly concerning reports produced by the IPCC in this time, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise year-on-year.\n\nHowever, there is some hope we may be nearing the peak in global emissions. By the time the next IPCC reports are released, global climate action may have finally started to move the world onto a more sustainable pathway.\n\nTime will tell. Let's hope policy makers will stand with the science on the right side of history.\n\nRead more:\n\nIPCC says the tools to stop catastrophic climate change are in our hands.

On Monday the world will receive the latest United Nations climate report. And it's a big one.\n\nHundreds of scientists, forming what's known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have been working hard behind the scenes. They've produced a series of reports in the latest round, which began in 2015. But on Monday it all comes together in what's called the Synthesis Report.\n\nIt will explain how greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet, then delve into the consequences. There's a focus on where we are most vulnerable, as well as efforts to adapt. And then, how we're acting to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.\n\nGathering all the evidence, from every corner of the globe, is an enormous undertaking, let alone reviewing the science to achieve consensus. It's a process that has been repeated several times since it began, more than three decades ago.\n\nThis is the sixth round of reports. And it won't be the last. But this is a crucial moment, because the chance to limit warming and avert dangerous climate change is slipping away.\n\nRead more: 6 reasons 2023 could be a very good year for climate action\n\nWhat is the IPCC and why do we need it?\n\nThe IPCC is comprised of 195 member countries charged with producing comprehensive and objective assessments of the scientific evidence for climate change.\n\nThe World Economic Forum ranks climate action failure as the number-one risk on a global scale over the next decade. And several other top-ten global risks - extreme weather, biodiversity loss, human environment damage and natural resource crises - are made worse by climate change.\n\nGovernments, industries and communities are becoming increasingly aware of the need to tackle climate change, especially as predictions become reality.\n\nThe scientific effort to understand the causes, effects and solutions is vast and growing. Every year tens of thousands of new peer-reviewed scientific studies on climate change are published. There has to be a way to identify key messages across this enormous body of scientific evidence, and use this information to make better decisions. This is what IPCC reports do.\n\nThe IPCC process also provides a framework for the scientific community to organise and coordinate their efforts. Each reporting cycle is matched with an international scientific effort, where standardised experiments are run to test the reliability of current climate models.\n\nThe experiments include multiple possible scenarios for how atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations could change in the future, depending on choices made today. The range of results produced by different models across these sets of experiments helps to determine how confident we are in the climate change impacts expected in the future.\n\nA key aspect of IPCC reports is that they are co-produced between scientists and governments. The summary of each report is negotiated and approved line by line, with consensus from all of the IPCC member governments. This process ensures the reports remain true to the underlying scientific evidence, but also pull out the key information governments need.\n\nWhat can we expect from Monday's report?\n\nThe Synthesis Report will draw on all six reports released in the current cycle.\n\nIt includes three so-called \"working group reports\":\n\nThe Physical Science Basis\n\nImpacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\n\nMitigation of Climate Change.\n\nIn addition, three special reports cut across these working groups and tackled focused topics, where governments requested rapid assessments to aid in their decision making:\n\nGlobal Warming of 1.5\u2103\n\nClimate Change and Land\n\nThe Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.\n\nThe headline statements from this cycle of IPCC reports have been clearer than ever. They leave absolutely no room for disputing human-caused warming and the need for urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, this decade. We can expect similarly strong and clear headlines from Monday's report.\n\nHow have IPCC reports changed?\n\nLooking back over IPCC reports from the past 33 years demonstrates how our understanding of climate change has improved. The first report in 1990 stated: \"the unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect from observations is not likely for more than a decade\". Fast forward to 2021 and the equivalent assessment now states: \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land\".\n\nIn some cases, the pace of change has dramatically exceeded expectations. In 1990 West Antarctica was a region of concern but not expected to lose major amounts of ice in the next century. But by 2019 our observations show glaciers in West Antarctica retreating rapidly. This has contributed to an accelerating rise in global sea level.\n\nThere are also emerging concerns for the stability of parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet once thought to be protected from human-caused climate warming.\n\nThis demonstrates the tendency for IPCC assessments to understate the scientific evidence. Climate science is often accused of being alarmist - particularly by those trying to delay climate change action - but in fact the opposite is true.\n\nThe production of IPCC reports by consensus with governments means that statements that appear in the report summaries are justified by multiple lines of scientific evidence. This can lag behind current climate science discoveries.\n\nRead more: Friday essay: 'I feel my heart breaking today' - a climate scientist's path through grief towards hope\n\nWhat's next?\n\nPlans are already underway for the next assessment cycle of the IPCC, which is to begin in July this year. It's hoped the next round of reports will be produced in time to inform the Global Stocktake in 2028, where progress towards the Paris Agreement will be assessed.\n\nThe current (sixth assessment) cycle has been gruelling. Scientists have stepped up their commitment to work with governments to provide the clear and robust information required.\n\nWriting and approving reports amid a global pandemic added to the challenges. So too did the inclusion of three special reports in addition to the usual three working group reports.\n\nThe evidence for human-caused climate change is now unequivocal. This has prompted calls for future IPCC reports to more efficiently assess rapidly changing areas of science and cut across the working groups. This would bring together assessments of the causes, impacts and solutions for key aspects of climate change in one report, rather than always separating them into individual working group reports.\n\nThe establishment of the IPCC signalled climate change was an important global problem. Despite this recognition more than three decades ago, and the increasingly concerning reports produced by the IPCC in this time, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise year-on-year.\n\nHowever, there is some hope we may be nearing the peak in global emissions. By the time the next IPCC reports are released, global climate action may have finally started to move the world onto a more sustainable pathway.\n\nTime will tell. Let's hope policy makers will stand with the science on the right side of history.\n\nRead more: IPCC says the tools to stop catastrophic climate change are in our hands. Here's how to use them",

                    "title": "Earth Today | IPCC gets UNEP endorsement",
                    "body": "THE UNITED Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has given a ringing endorsement of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as it moves to gain formal approval for its latest Synthesis Report that reflects the extent of the global climate change challenge.\n\n\"This report is critical, as it brings together the findings of the assessment reports and special reports in one powerful package - a package that lays out the scale and impacts of human-induced climate change,\" said UNEP boss, Inger Andersen, addressing the opening ceremony of the 58th session of the IPCC on March 13.\n\nShe was referencing the reports of the IPCC's Working Group I, II and III, notably The Physical Science Basis, that examined the science that underpins the past, present and future climate change; Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability that took stock of the vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change and options for adaptation; and Mitigation of Climate Change, which had as its focus an evaluation of methods for emissions reduction and the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\n\nTogether, she said, the reports confirm the reality of a changing climate while establishing the threat to human well-being and the health of the planet; as well as the need for greater ambition to cut emissions.\n\n\"Even though the international response is not yet strong or fast enough - on adaptation or mitigation - the IPCC's science has made a difference. IPCC reports have historically influenced climate change negotiations,\" Andersen noted.\n\n\"The Sixth Assessment reports and special reports influenced decisions at the climate negotiations in Glasgow and Sharm el-Sheikh - and indeed decisions in government offices and boardrooms across the world,\" she said further.\n\nImportantly, the UNEP boss noted that the Sixth Assessment reports had also helped to inform the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement.\n\nThat stocktake takes account of the status of climate action and support globally, including existing gaps and efforts to agree on solutions.\n\n\"We look forward to the third and final step of the first Global Stocktake, which will take place at COP28 (28th meeting of the UN climate talks) in the United Arab Emirates. The IPCC's input on this final step of the world's collective progress towards achieving the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement will set the tone for action in the second half of this critical decade,\" said Andersen.\n\n\"Make no mistake, action is the key word here. We need more action from governments, businesses and investors - indeed everyone. The IPCC's work, which chimes with UNEP's own research, tells us that we have the knowledge and technology we need,\" she added.\n\n\"That we can start slashing emissions and helping vulnerable communities adapt to climate change. And that by acting on climate, we are also acting on nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste - the other two prongs of the triple planetary crisis,\" Andersen said further.\n\nThe IPCC is currently meeting in Switzerland to consider its latest Synthesis Report, which integrates not only its three working group reports but also three special reports - including the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nOver the course of the meeting, which goes until March 17, governments are expected to approve, line by line, the Summary for Policymakers of that report.\n\nIPCC chair, Dr Hoseung Lee, meanwhile, said the IPCC feels \"a great sense of collective pride and achievement\" for its work since 2015.\n\nThis has been the most productive cycle in IPCC's 35-year-long history. Together, we have delivered three special reports, three Working Groups' reports and a methodology document. Much of this work had to be carried out in unforeseen and threatening circumstances of a deadly pandemic,\" Lee noted.\n\n\"But each IPCC contribution has been an extraordinary feat of painstakingly hard work by hundreds of scientists and experts. Each contribution added a new, strong scientific pillar supporting and guiding critically important negotiations and processes aimed at tackling the challenge of global warming and climate change.\n\nAt the same time, he noted that the impact of that collective work is anticipated to be significant.\n\n\"Once approved, the Synthesis Report, will become a fundamental policy document for shaping climate action in the remainder of this pivotal decade. For policymakers of today and tomorrow, a much-needed textbook for addressing climate change. Make no mistake, inaction and delays are not listed as options,\" he said.\n\n\"Our work this week warrants our undivided attention and commitment. I have no doubt that our careful approval of the Summary for Policymakers will deliver a scientifically robust and policy-relevant report. By doing so, we will bring the sixth assessment cycle to a successful closure and complete the towering task we were given,\" Lee added.",

                    "body": "Support us and go ad-free\n\nThe Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) began an important meeting on 13 March. In the week-long session, the IPCC will distill its findings from six reports on the climate crisis and amass them in a single 'synthesis' report. This report will be the closing act of the body's sixth assessment cycle. In a nutshell, it will be a comprehensive manual for tackling the crisis.\n\nThe meeting comes hot on the heels of Saudi Arabia's oil giant Aramco announcing colossal profits for 2022. It also follows the energy industry holding its own meeting in Houston, US. Discussions at this gathering made it clear that the industry overall has little intention of slowing down, let alone stopping, fossil fuel production.\n\nIPCC: inaction and delay not an option\n\nDuring the IPCC meeting's opening ceremony in Switzerland, IPCC chair Hoesung Lee said that the synthesis report will be a:\n\nfundamental policy document for shaping climate action in the remainder of this pivotal decade\n\nSign up to our FREE Daily News Digest We will not share your information with third parties. Please see our Privacy Policy for information.\n\nHe emphasised that this \"textbook for addressing climate change\" will not include \"inaction and delays\" among its options.\n\nIn its sixth assessment reports, the IPCC emphasised that emissions reductions in the 2020s are essential if the world is to stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. The 2015 Paris Agreement set a core goal of trying to limit warming to 1.5C, and to cap it at \"well under\" 2C.\n\nAs the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) secretary-general has explained, the 1.5C threshold is an indicator of:\n\nRelated articles British colonial 'wastelands' system used for solar land-grabs in India 'Embracing equity' will remain impossible in a world where fossil fuel companies exist\n\nRead on...\n\nthe point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet.\n\nThe IPCC's 2022 report, which focused on climate change mitigation, outlined ways to halve emissions by 2030. But overall emissions are not moving in the right direction, with record highs globally in 2022.\n\nFossil fuel phase out is critical\n\nUN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who also spoke at the ceremony, stressed the urgency of swift action on emissions reduction:\n\nOur world is at a crossroads - and our planet is in the crosshairs.\n\nWe are nearing the point of no return; of overshooting the internationally agreed limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming.\n\nHe pointed to the obvious in relation to this, namely that limiting global warming requires policymakers to \"accelerate the phasing out of fossil fuels\". This is because burning fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases, which are the primary driver of global warming.\n\nAs Inside Climate News reported, however, the fossil fuel industry recently held its own week-long meeting. At the CERAWeek conference, fossil fuel executives appeared to breathe a collective sigh of relief that an accelerated phase out of fossil fuels is, as yet, nowhere in sight.\n\nAs the publication explained, heads of fossil fuel companies at the event highlighted that:\n\nthe war in Ukraine has helped make the case for fossil fuels and a \"balanced\" energy transition\n\nFor instance, the chief executive of ConocoPhillips, Ryan Lance, said:\n\nIt's finally becoming reality after the Ukraine invasion, the need for energy security\n\nLance continued, saying that the war has:\n\nreally balanced and tipped the equation back probably in a more appropriate proportion.\n\nOthers at the conference were more explicit about how they planned to navigate the energy transition. Rick Muncrief, chief executive of Devon Energy, said:\n\nOur strategy is to stay as oily as we can for as long as we can\n\nWillow Project\n\nIt's unsurprising that fossil fuel companies welcome a focus on 'energy security'. Talk of energy security and a greenlight for fossil fuel expansion tend to go hand in hand. ConocoPhillips' own recent experience offers a prime example of this.\n\nJoe Biden's administration approved the company's Willow Project in Alaska on 13 March. The approval will enable ConocoPhillips to drill for new sources of oil and gas in the National Petroleum Reserve. As the BBC reported, lawmakers who represent Alaska in Congress have argued that the project:\n\nwould help boost domestic energy production and lessen the country's reliance on foreign oil\n\nMeanwhile, in his comments about the approval, Lance also claimed that the project will enhance US energy security.\n\nNot real security\n\nOrganisations like Greenpeace and the Rapid Transition Alliance say that fossil fuel expansion doesn't provide real energy security. The UK, for example, promised fossil fuel expansion in the North Sea in its 2022 Energy Security Strategy. But the Alliance has argued that:\n\nopening up more oil and gas fields in the North Sea will not ensure the UK's energy security - it will do the exact opposite. Newly pumped reserves will be owned by the privately owned companies that win the licensing rounds and sold through international export markets to the highest bidder.\n\nMoreover, the expansions guarantee further climate insecurity, as criticism of the Willow Project highlighted. The Center for Biological Diversity's Kristen Monsell was among those who condemned the decision. She said:\n\nBiden approved Willow knowing full well that it'll cause massive and irreversible destruction, which is appalling.\n\nPeople and wildlife will suffer, and extracting and burning more fossil fuel will warm the climate even faster.\n\nSky-high profits\n\nIn recent weeks, energy companies have revealed their 2022 profits. This was when the invasion of Ukraine triggered more 'balance' in the energy transition, according to the industry chiefs at CERAweek.\n\nThe latest announcement came from Saudi Arabia's Aramco, a state-owned company. It made a record-breaking $161bn during the year. This amounts to the highest recorded annual profits for a publicly listed company in history.\n\nBP, meanwhile, doubled its profits in 2022 - to a record \u00a323bn - compared to the previous year. Shell also made more profit in 2022 than it has done in any other year of its 115-year history, raking in \u00a332.2bn.\n\nWith these figures in mind, it's not hard to see why the fossil fuel industry is determined to continue and expand its operations. As Guterres said, though, policymakers urgently need to phase out fossil fuels to limit global warming. In other words, the priorities of policymakers and the fossil fuel industry should - theoretically - diverge at this juncture.\n\nThat's clearly not manifesting in policymakers' decision-making to the necessary extent, with many continuing to embrace fossil fuels. Moreover, state-owned companies are even at the vanguard of profiteering from their continued burning, as Aramco's 2022 haul shows.\n\nAn instructive example\n\nGuterres said that the IPCC synthesis report will provide \"solid, frank, detailed scientific guidance\" for world leaders at the next UN climate conference. The guidance, he suggested, can assist policymakers to make the right decisions and \"bring the world in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement\".\n\nThis climate conference provides an instructive illustration of the current prospects for meaningful action by policymakers. The UAE holds the presidency for the conference. More specifically, the country's minister Sultan Al Jaber will head up the negotiations - who also happens to be the chief executive of the UAE's national oil company.\n\nSo, as solid as the IPCC's guidance might be, an oil executive will ultimately determine the direction of travel. Campaigners have called this out as a clear conflict of interest.\n\nTo varying degrees, this is the issue at the heart of various environmental emergencies the world faces. Decision makers too often appear aligned - in thought and deed - with interests that are not only responsible for the crises, but actively pushing against the reforms necessary to tackle them. Until this changes, meaningful action will remain out of reach.\n\nFeatured image via Ideum - ideas + media / Flickr, cropped to 770\u00d7403, licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0",

For policymakers of today and tomorrow, a much-needed textbook for addressing climate change. Make no mistake, inaction and delays are not listed as options.\"\n\nThe Synthesis Report is the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report's final installment, integrating and summarising the conclusions of the six IPCC reports released during the current cycle, which began in 2015.\n\nThree Special Reports and three IPCC working group contributions to the Sixth Assessment Report are included in the report.\n\nThe IPCC will approve the Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers line by line, and the panel will also adopt the full report section by section.\n\nThe host country's Federal Councilor, Albert R\u00f6sti, stated that the results of the intergovernmental panel on climate change will assist policymakers in making educated choices about climate change.\n\n\"Science and knowledge must play a central role in shaping our policy-making, guiding us as we work to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change,\" said Mr R\u00f6sti.\n\nAccording to UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the IPCC's evidence for climate change has been clear, persuasive, and irrefutable, and must guide the way to solutions to the urgent need to cease global warming with cold, hard facts.\n\n\"The IPCC must now point the way to solutions so the urgent need to end global heating with cold, hard facts,\" said Ant\u00f3nio\n\nAt the plenary, video messages from Mr. Guterres and WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas praised the IPCC's hard work on the reports, which he said had a clear message for decision-makers.\n\n\"We need to speed up our climate actions. At the moment, we are heading towards too high warming, and the various impacts of climate change are already very visible worldwide,\" said Prof. Taalas.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a United Nations group that was founded in 1988 to offer political leaders with periodic scientific assessments of climate change, its consequences, and hazards, as well as to propose adaptation and mitigation solutions.",

                    "title": "Analysis: How the diversity of IPCC authors has changed over three decades - Carbon Brief",
                    "body": "The proportion of female and global south authors of reports by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has risen over the past three decades - but still lags behind male and global-north authors, according to analysis by Carbon Brief.\n\nSince its foundation in 1988, the IPCC has published six sets of \"assessment reports\". These documents summarise the latest scientific evidence about human-caused climate change and are considered the most authoritative reports on the subject.\n\nThe IPCC has also produced a series of \"special reports\", focusing on specific areas of climate change.\n\nCarbon Brief has analysed the authors of all six sets of assessment reports, as well as the most recent five special reports.\n\nThe data shows that women and experts from the global south have gained greater representation in IPCC reports over time, but are still underrepresented compared to their male and global-north counterparts.\n\nThe IPCC's first assessment report, published in 1990, had around 100 authors. The analysis shows that fewer than 10% of these authors were women and fewer than 20% came from institutions in the global south.\n\nThe first assessment report did not have a single female contributor to its Working Group I report on climate science.\n\nIn contrast, the latest assessment cycle - which sees its synthesis report published next week - boasts more than 700 authors in total, of whom more than 30% are women and more than 40% are from the global south.\n\nCarbon Brief spoke to a wide range of IPCC authors and experts about their experiences in the organisation.\n\nMany experts stress the time commitment required during their tenure at the IPCC, calling the work \"intense\", \"stressful\" and \"unsustainable\".\n\nExperts also highlight the barriers they have faced or seen during their time in the IPCC - including language, gender discrimination, funding issues and cultural barriers.\n\n\"Strong, dominant, often male voices tend to take over,\" an IPCC co-chair tells Carbon Brief.\n\n\"Unconscious biases are present even if you select the brightest scientists,\" another co-chair tells Carbon Brief.\n\nHowever, they also tell Carbon Brief about the improvements in diversity and awareness over the past three decades.\n\nThe head of the IPCC's gender action team tells Carbon Brief about the advances made in gender equality, while IPCC co-chairs explain how they consider diversity when choosing authors for their reports.\n\nBelow, Carbon Brief walks through its findings via a series of charts and maps. It also explores how the IPCC's treatment of diversity has evolved since the organisation was created in 1988.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been publishing the world's most authoritative summaries of the state of climate science since its formation in 1988. Its reports - which often run thousands of pages in length - take years to produce and are used by policymakers, scientists and organisations around the world.\n\nEvery five-to-seven years, the body publishes a series of reports summarising the latest knowledge around climate change, made up of three \"working groups\". These are themed around the science of climate change, its impacts and its solutions, respectively. For all except the first IPCC report, the body also produces a \"synthesis report\", summarising key points from the three working group reports.\n\nIn addition, the IPCC has published 14 \"special reports\", focusing on more specific areas of climate change, which are linked to specific assessments - such as oceans and cryosphere, aviation or emission scenarios.\n\nCarbon Brief has brought together data about the authors of all six assessment reports - including the three working groups and synthesis reports - as well as the five most recent special reports. This includes each author's name, gender, country and institution.\n\nThe table below shows the number of authors in each of the IPCC reports included in this analysis. The different colours of shading indicate different assessment cycles.\n\nThe two special reports published in 2011 and 2012 - the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) and Special Report on Extreme Events (SREX) - are part of the fifth assessment report and are referred to as the SR5 reports in this analysis.\n\nMeanwhile, the Special Report on 1.5C, Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate and Special Report on Climate Change and Land - published over 2018-19 - are part of the sixth assessment report and are referred to collectively as SR6.\n\nAround 100 authors worked together to write the first assessment report (FAR), which was published in 1990 - just two years after the IPCC was founded. Meanwhile, the sixth assessment cycle (AR6) of six reports took almost 1,000 authors and seven years to write.\n\nHundreds of experts have invested years of work into each of these reports, which pull together thousands of peer-reviewed studies and reports. Coordinating lead authors (CLA), lead authors (LA) and review editors (REs) work together to produce these reports. The IPCC website explains the difference between these roles:\n\n\"CLAs and LAs have collective responsibility for the contents of a chapter. CLAs are responsible for coordinating work on major sections of a report such as chapters. LAs are responsible for the production of designated sections of the report within a chapter on the basis of the best scientific, technical and socioeconomic information available.\n\n\"REs help identify expert reviewers, ensure that all substantive comments are afforded appropriate consideration and advise LAs on how to handle contentious or controversial issues.\"\n\nThere are other roles in the IPCC that Carbon Brief has not included in this analysis. For example, each report also has hundreds of \"contributing authors\", who are enlisted to provide specific knowledge or expertise in a given area but are too numerous to include in this analysis. Meanwhile, the IPCC also has a \"bureau\" of experts, including the vice and co-chairs, who have more managerial roles and are also not included in this work.\n\nThe IPCC's first ever assessment report had around 100 of authors of whom only eight were women. Female representation in the IPCC has since steadily risen over time and by the publication of AR6 more than one-third of authors were female.\n\nThe plot below shows the gender balance of the IPCC reports. Each dot represents one person - with women shown in orange and men in purple. Where one author contributed to multiple working group reports in the same assessment cycle, these repeats have been removed. The orange line shows how the percentage of women in these reports has increased over time.\n\nBreaking down each of the main assessment reports into its three different working groups and synthesis report shows a more nuanced picture, as shown below. (The graphic below does not show the special reports, as the writing process for these reports is not separated into working groups.)\n\nAnalysis of individual working groups shows that Working Group I (WG1) - which explores the physical science basis of climate change - is consistently more male-dominated than impacts-focused Working Group II (WG2). In fact, the first assessment report did not have a single female contributor to its WG1 report.\n\nWhile there was no synthesis report in the first assessment report, the second synthesis report did not have a single female author. However, by AR6, women represented more than 40% of synthesis report authors.\n\nCarbon Brief also tracked how female appointments to different roles within the authorship team have changed over time. The plot below shows the percentage of female CLAs (yellow), LAs (dark blue) and REs (light blue) for every report from AR4 onwards.\n\nThe plot shows that women were better represented across all three authorship roles than they were 15 years ago. In most reports since AR4, there was a lower proportion of women in coordinating lead author roles than lead author roles, the analysis finds.\n\nBack to top\n\nMore than 120 different countries are represented by the authors of IPCC reports. However, the spread of authors is not evenly distributed across the globe.\n\nThe map below shows the number of authors from each country, across all IPCC reports included in this analysis. The map on the left shows countries in the global north, while the map on the right shows those in the global south. Darker colours indicate more authors.\n\nThe table below shows the total number of authors from each country:\n\nSumming up over all of the IPCC reports in this analysis, the US and UK have the largest number of authors. Three of the top 10 countries are from Asia and one is from South America. However, the first African country in this ranking is not seen until South Africa - at number 18.\n\nAs with gender, the balance of experts from the global north and global south has improved over recent decades. The number of authors from each continent over the six assessment cycles - as well as the five special reports - are shown in the plot below.\n\nEach dot represents one person - with experts from global south countries shown in red and global north countries in blue. Where one author contributed to multiple working group reports in the same assessment cycle, these repeats have been removed. The red line shows how the percentage of experts from the global south in these reports has increased over time.\n\nOnly around 20 countries were represented in the first assessment report and 11% of authors were from the global south. By 2023, with the publication of the AR6, 87 countries were represented and 43% of authors were from the global south.\n\nA closer look at the contributions of different continents shows that the drop in global- north authorship is largely driven by a fall in representation from North America.\n\nThe plot below shows the changing proportion of experts from Europe (dark blue), Asia (red), North America (yellow), Latin America and the Caribbean (orange), Africa (purple) and Oceania (light blue) to the six main assessment cycles and five most recent assessment reports.\n\nThe percentage of authors from North America has been decreasing for the last three decades - largely driven by a drop in the dominance of authors from the US. Almost 30% of authors from the first assessment report came from the US, but this percentage dropped to around 10% by AR6.\n\nMeanwhile, the percentage of authors from most other continents have remained constant or increased.\n\nCarbon Brief also investigated the change in global south representation between the different working groups, as shown below. Special reports are not included in this graphic, as these are not separated into working groups.\n\nThis shows that WG1, which focuses on the physical science basis, consistently has the lowest representation of authors from the global south.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe IPCC brings together a range of early career and experienced researchers to write its assessment reports. Many of the authors of the most recent assessment report have worked on multiple IPCC cycles.\n\nDr Adam Standring is a postdoctoral researcher in environmental sociology at Orebro University in Sweden and has spent years studying diversity and processes in the IPCC, including interviewing dozens of IPCC authors. He jokingly referred to these veteran authors as \"IPCC dinosaurs\".\n\nThe table below shows the top eight experts who have authored the most IPCC reports. There is a 50-50 split of experts from the global north and south, but only one of the experts identifies as female.\n\nBorn in Peru, Dr Jose Antonio Marengo Orsini completed his PhD in the US, before moving to Brazil for work. He has worked in roles including general coordinator of the Center for Earth System Science and head of the research and development sector of Brazil's National Center for Natural Disaster Monitoring and Alerts.\n\nHe has worked on eight separate IPCC reports across CLA, LA and RE roles. However, his involvement in the IPCC began when he was invited to be a contributing author for the second assessment report. \"I didn't know what the IPCC was, but I liked what I saw,\" he tells Carbon Brief. He adds:\n\n\"I really started to like the interaction and the emotion, because it's not just work. We find new friends. We find old friends. We work together. We socialise.\n\n\"This is very heavy work, but it's worth it...we get access to the latest information, the best papers and interaction with the best scientists in the field.\"\n\nHe tells Carbon Brief that it is an \"academic honour\" to have worked with the IPCC.\n\nDr Keywan Riahi is the director of the Energy, Climate and Environment Program at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). He started working with the IPCC in the 1990s for the special report on emission scenarios which was published in the year 2000, and has since worked on eight WG3 reports, synthesis reports and special reports.\n\n\"It was very natural for me to join the writing team at that time since IIASA was spearheading the report,\" Riahi tells Carbon Brief. Riahi has dual Iranian and Austrian nationality. He says that \"the multi-cultural background is helpful in the IPCC where it is essential to understand where other people with a completely different worldview are coming from\".\n\nOrsini and Keywan are among the more than 350 entries in the database who have different listings for \"country\" and \"nationality\". The analysis of these shows that, in many instances, experts had a global south nationality, but were affiliated with an institution in the global north and so had a global north country listed in the IPCC's data.\n\nCarbon Brief used the listing for \"country\" for the main part of this analysis - as citizenship data is only available in the more recent reports.\n\nChanging from \"country\" to \"nationality\" increases the percentage of authors from this sample with a global south affiliation from 23% to 38% - with every global south country seeing more people listed under nationality than country, and vice versa.\n\nIn total, fewer than 60 of the roughly 4,000 entries list both global north and global south countries, so this does not affect the overarching findings of the analysis.\n\nFocusing on the organisations that the authors work for, the table below shows the top 11 institutions most represented among IPCC authors. Four are in the US and three are in Asia - two in Japan and one in China. None of the top institutions are based in South America or Africa.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe IPCC is an international organisation. As such, many experts interviewed by Carbon Brief stress that its outputs must reflect a diversity of research and opinions from around the world.\n\nStandring tells Carbon Brief that the body is \"legitimate\" and \"authoritative\" in large part due to its international reach. He adds:\n\n\"The purpose of the IPCC is as much the process as it is the content. It is difficult to separate this idea of process and content because they both give it legitimacy - and an important part of that is diversity.\"\n\nFor scientists to become IPCC authors, they must nominate themselves or be nominated by someone else to their country's \"national focal point\", which is often the country's ministry of environment, climate change or meteorology. It is the focal point's job to assess the applications and send a subset to the IPCC for their consideration.\n\nHowever, Standring tells Carbon Brief that \"not all selection processes are the same at the national level\". He adds:\n\n\"Some countries will just open up [the call for authors], publicise it to whichever institutions might be interested and then just collect the CVs... Some governments will do their own form of pre-selection process before sending off the applications. And in some governments it is essentially a political process - you have to be 'friendly' to the government.\"\n\nMeanwhile, when summarising their 2019 report (pdf), the IPCC gender taskforce said:\n\n\"Most nominations to the IPCC are made through government agencies and other national focal points. These can reflect scientific hierarchies and biases in countries and organisations that favour men. Cultural patterns such as a greater reluctance by women to put themselves forward and obligations to family could also be factors. Opportunities to join the IPCC might not be widely publicised, narrowing the pool.\"\n\nStandring tells Carbon Brief that hundreds of international \"observer organisations\", such as the World Meteorological Organisation, can also nominate experts, presenting a \"workaround\" for experts who are unwilling or unable to apply through their national focal point.\n\nThe final decision on authors lies with the IPCC bureau - which consists of the chair and vice-chairs, as well as a pair of co-chairs for each working group.\n\nDr Valerie Masson-Delmotte - research director at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission - worked on the WG1 reports in AR4 and AR5 before being elected (pdf) as one of the two AR6 WG1 co-chairs.\n\nShe tells Carbon Brief that, \"for co-chairs of working groups, it has to be a pair with one from a developed one from a developing country\". However, she says there is no such rule for gender.\n\nThe bureau selects the LAs, CLAs and REs for each working group based on CVs and application forms. According to the IPCC website, the bureau \"aims to reflect a range of scientific, technical and socioeconomic views and backgrounds\" when selecting authors (pdf).\n\nKo Barrett is a vice-chair at the IPCC and the senior advisor for climate at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). She also served as a lead negotiator for the US on the UN treaty on climate change and represented the US in delegation charged with negotiating and adopting scientific assessments undertaken by the IPCC for 15 years.\n\nShe tells Carbon Brief that there is no quota on the gender or nationality of authors as the bureau must \"first and foremost must ensure we have the scientific expertise required to address the topics outlined in the report\". However, she adds:\n\n\"We as an organisation recognise the value of diversity in helping us to examine relevant issues from many sides and from different lived experiences, so we keep an eye on balance of all types to assist us in providing the best assessments we can.\"\n\nMasson-Delmotte received around 1,000 author nominations for AR6 WG1 and selected 234, she tells Carbon Brief, explaining her considerations when selecting authors:\n\n\"In addition to looking for expertise, to have your eyes open, to be aware of your own biases, and to be open for all types of diversity, which is not just gender, it also means diversity of experience, diversity of regions, diversity of past experience and those new to the IPCC.\"\n\nIndividuals with dual citizenship can choose which country to submit their application through. Dr Yamina Saheb is a senior energy policy analyst at OpenExp who worked as a lead author on the AR6 WG3 report. Saheb was born in Algeria, but has dual French-Algerian citizenship and lives and works in Paris. In the IPCC data, she is listed with Algerian nationality, while her \"country\" is France.\n\nShe tells Carbon Brief that she initially applied to be an IPCC author through the French focal point, but was told the competition would be \"extremely tough\" due to the high quality of applicants from this focal point.\n\nSaheb tells Carbon Brief that she does not work in academia - so, unlike her peers, she was not affiliated with a research institution and did not have an extensive record of work published in peer-reviewed journals. This could have hindered her chances of being selected, she explains.\n\nUnder advice from the French focal point, Saheb organised for the Algerian focal point to bring her application to the IPCC with the support of France instead. This application was successful.\n\nConversely, Marengo Orsini was born in Peru but has spent much of his working life in Brazil. The latter has always put forward his IPCC applications. He tells Carbon Brief that he knows many other South Americans working in Europe or North America who are put forward to the IPCC by the focal points of global north countries.\n\nOne AR6 author from Africa tells Carbon Brief that they \"never heard back\" from their national focal point and were instead forced to submit their application through an international observer organisation. They suggest that one contributing factor behind the low number of authors from Africa \"might be the fact that countries focal points are not actively engaged in the process or are not submitting nominations of their country's scientists\".\n\nDr Izidine Pinto - an AR6 WG1 lead author from Mozambique - says that an expert's publication record is one of the metrics the bureau uses when selecting authors. He tells Carbon Brief that scientists from Africa are less likely to publish high-quality peer-reviewed literature, presenting a barrier to their selection.\n\nSaheb adds that the bureau is likely to select authors that they already know or have worked with. \"Bureau members have co-authored publications with some of the people they selected,\" she said\n\nStandring tells Carbon Brief that, in the early days of the IPCC, authors were selected \"very informally\" - often via a phone call from a friend or colleague rather than a recommendation from the government. Orsini confirms this, telling Carbon Brief that when he joined the IPCC, \"authors could invite whoever they want\".\n\nAlthough the process has become \"formalised\", Standring describes the IPCC author selection process as a \"black box\" that varies between different countries, working groups and assessment cycles. He adds there are still many questions about the process that need to be explored:\n\n\"They're not being obstructive on purpose. But there are certain things which the IPCC don't want examined too closely.\n\n\"It's completely understandable when you recognise that it's not a scientific organisation. It's a science-policy interface. Policy implies politics, and politics is the messy bit. It has some uncomfortable truths about these things around nominations about how and why certain countries have to be represented and what they contribute to the IPCC.\"\n\nBack to top\n\nIPCC authors are not paid, instead volunteering hundreds of hours of their time to write reports and travel for meetings - which can take place anywhere in the world and last many days.\n\nMeanwhile, when summarising their 2019 report (pdf), the IPCC gender taskforce said:\n\n\"Many IPCC authors contribute on top of their full-time jobs. Most bureau members and authors are not paid by the IPCC. They also generally have to fund their own travel, although travel support is provided for people from developing countries.\"\n\nThe taskforce surveyed more than 1,520 IPCC authors and found that lack of time was the greatest barrier to participation in the IPCC. The the top six barriers were:\n\nBarrett tells Carbon Brief that the workload is \"cyclical\". She says:\n\n\"In the years where we have no report approvals, it is a very manageable workload in addition to my NOAA work. But when we are preparing for or approving a report, the IPCC job is two jobs in itself, working round the clock. Those can be stressful times that require me to drop everything else.\"\n\nMasson-Delmotte had young children when she worked as a CLA for the AR5 report. \"It was a very busy schedule and I had promised my husband this would be over,\" she recalls. So she tells Carbon Brief that when invited to be a co-chair for AR6, she initially turned down the position.\n\nHowever, she changed her mind when the request came a second time, because she realised the proportion of female co-chairs was so low, she tells Carbon Brief. Nevertheless, the work was hard:\n\n\"This was not part of my career plan. I was very worried about not being able to continue my own research...My fear turned true, in a way...It has been nonstop. And the worst was when working on the three special reports in parallel with the start of the work on the WG1 main report.\"\n\nShe adds:\n\n\"Personally, I've checked on every nomination - like CV and profile - and I've read all versions of chapters of all reports, just to do my job. So it was intense, I have to say...I think it was not sustainable in terms of work capacity and workload.\"\n\nShe tells Carbon Brief that, looking back, she is \"really glad\" that she took on the \"challenge\". But, at the same time, she is resolute that \"my involvement with IPCC will finish at the end of this cycle\".\n\nProf Emilio L\u00e8bre La Rovere is a Brazilian climate scientist with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and worked with the IPCC in the second, third and fourth assessment cycles. He tells Carbon Brief that the work that goes into the reports is \"really a huge test\".\n\nHe explains that, each time a new draft of the report is finalised, it is \"submitted for comments and suggestions by the scientific community, by international organisations, by governments as well\". He adds that a report of 200 pages could receive 1,000 pages of comments and suggestions, which the authors must then address one by one.\n\nHowever, much of the sixth assessment cycle was conducted online - often over Zoom. Many experts told Carbon Brief that this changed the dynamics of the meeting - in both positive and negative ways.\n\nFor example, Masson-Delmotte says that \"when you are locked in at home with kids, it doesn't help, but at the same time it allows some with family care or pregnancy to be more able to contribute\".\n\nAlthough most experts that Carbon Brief interviewed stressed the huge burden of work, many also discussed benefits and opportunities presented to them thanks to the work. Pinto tells Carbon Brief that working in the IPCC can boost an expert's career:\n\n\"Being selected as a leading expert from your discipline to be part of the IPCC is a prestigious achievement. It can provide a significant boost to your career or institution and it is an honour to be part of this process.\"\n\nThe IPCC gender taskforce survey found that many experts benefitted from their IPCC involvement, including making professional connections (80%), increasing their international reputation (81%) and having a learning experience (93%). The report concludes:\n\n\"IPCC work boosts scientific careers. Nomination and appointment as a lead author or review editor, or election as a bureau member, brings international recognition, academic repute and the potential to influence policy.\"\n\nThe IPCC \"helps you to strengthen your scientific or academic network\", Saheb tells Carbon Brief. However, she questions whether people from the global south are benefiting from this as much as their northern counterparts.\n\nWhen Prof Debra Roberts was selected as a co-chair of the AR6 WG2, she became the first local government practitioner and woman from Africa to co-chair an IPCC working group. She tells Carbon Brief that, within her community of academic practitioners, \"very often the employers don't see the value of IPCC participation\". She continues:\n\n\"The problem is with knowledge communities like mine, it's a distraction from the work that you're paid to do...so you have some people who are running full time jobs and are trying to do IPCC work at the same time.\"\n\nShe adds that the sixth assessment cycle was the \"longest and busiest\" due to the unexpected addition of three special reports and the delays caused by the pandemic, resulting in a noticeable \"drop off\" in the involvement of the authors who are \"most under pressure with the least resources\".\n\nThese are often experts from the global south who do not have the same \"social safety net\" as their global north counterparts when it comes to financial support, childcare or caring for elderly family members, she says:\n\n\"I think we must recognise that it's not the same for everyone and if the aim is to involve a diversity of knowledge holders in the assessment, the involvement in the IPCC is not going to have the same value to everyone. So it may be great for some, but it may be a real burden for others.\"\n\nBack to top\n\nKo Barrett is one of the first female IPCC vice-chairs and has championed gender equality during her time in office as the head of the gender action team.\n\nShe tells Carbon Brief that her decision to run for vice-chair was \"last minute\":\n\n\"A number of senior people in our government thought it was long past time for women to play senior leadership roles in IPCC and put me forward. At the same time, Brazil had nominated Thelma Krug, a seasoned scientist also with a long history with IPCC.\n\n\"Together we were the first women elected to be vice-chairs. Together with Valerie and Debra as WG Chairs, and all of the other women in the Bureau, it feels like we are making a difference and setting an example for other women to come after us.\"\n\nRoberts and Masson-Delmotte \"made history\" when they co-chaired an approval session on the SR15 report as \"never before in the three decades of IPCC history had there been a point where two female co-chairs had chaired a session\", Roberts explains.\n\nIn fact, Roberts tells Carbon Brief that the IPCC bureau has only seen three female co-chairs in its 35-year history - including Masson-Delmotte and herself.\n\nIn March 2018, the IPCC decided to establish the \"task group on gender\" to develop a framework of goals and actions to improve gender balance and address gender-related issues within the IPCC.\n\nThe group sent out a survey to 1,520 contributors to understand how they perceived and experienced gender bias and barriers during their work with the IPCC. They received 533 replies - 39% from women and 58% from men. Most of the respondents were from Europe, the Americas and Asia, with 9% each from Africa and the south-west Pacific.\n\nThe group presented a report (pdf) on their findings in 2019, which documents that the majority of IPCC experts feel that the IPCC provided equal opportunities for men and women to participate, and that women were respected during the IPCC process. The main findings are shown in the graphic below.\n\nHowever, while \"most respondents\" had not experienced discrimination, the report finds that \"significantly more women reported a personal experience of biases or discriminations than men\". These included \"someone else taking credit for ideas (40% women vs 19% men), being ignored because of gender (39% women vs 5% men), being patronised because of gender (32% women vs 4% men), someone making comments about appearance (21% women vs 7% men), someone implying the respondent was only included in the IPCC because of their gender (29% women vs 2% men), and being sexually harassed (8% women vs 0% men)\".\n\nAt the same session where the task group on gender presented their report, the IPCC decided to establish a \"gender action team\", which carried out the Gender Policy and Implementation Plan (pdf).\n\nBarrett is the chair of this group and tells Carbon Brief about the other work they are doing:\n\n\"The gender action team is doing amazing things. We are sponsoring an expert meeting to learn from our experiences and set the next cycle for inclusive practices. We are sponsoring a survey for authors and leadership to glean feedback about what has worked and what needs improvement to enable the full and respectful participation of all in our work. And we are setting in place procedures to adjudicate complaints so we have the mechanisms in place to support our work. These are big steps for the IPCC and I couldn't be prouder.\"\n\nMasson-Delmotte tells Carbon Brief that around 30% of applications for AR6 WG1 came from women - a \"striking\" improvement from AR4. However, she notes that there is still work to be done:\n\n\"What is needed is to increase the pool of nominations and support climate scientists. So that they are encouraged to participate, they are supported by the institutions and governments to contribute. And this is not in our hands - it is broader than that.\"\n\nFurthermore, she says that women still \"self-censor\" their applications, leading to a \"glass ceiling\" effect of women dropping off from higher up roles. She highlights, for example, that the percentage of women is \"larger amongst the lead authors and then smaller for coordinating lead authors and sometimes almost absent in IPCC leadership\".\n\nEven once women are in their roles, they face barriers to participation in the IPCC, she says:\n\n\"What we can see sometimes in group discussions is a woman with a bright idea, and she's ignored and the idea is only noted by participants when the male participants repeat the same idea.\"\n\nRoberts agrees that, on Zoom calls, \"strong, dominant, often male voices tend to take over\". She adds that \"there's a big difference between achieving better numbers and actually having agency once you're in the room\".\n\n(Read more about the barriers faced by women and experts from the global south in academia in Carbon Brief's analysis: \"The lack of diversity in climate-science research\".)\n\nMasson-Delmotte tells Carbon Brief that the reports are also \"an opportunity to develop new role models\". She adds that she is \"really proud\" when she sees female IPCC authors \"using their voices\" and \"having more confidence in themselves\" in interviews, presentations and meetings.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe IPCC established the \"special committee on the participation of developing countries\" (pdf) in June 1998 to \"promote, as rapidly as possible, full participation of the developing countries in IPCC activities\". Alongside the three working groups published in the FAR, the IPCC also published a report from the new committee.\n\nThe report noted that \"when the IPCC began its work in November 1988, only a few developing countries attended\". It says these countries \"were lacking in neither interest nor concern\", but instead faced systemic barriers to participation.\n\nThe report identified five main factors that \"inhibit the full participation of the developing countries in the IPCC process\":\n\nThe report goes on to suggest actions that can be taken to reduce this imbalance. However, the IPCC press team tells Carbon Brief that the committee \"ended its term at the end of the first assessment cycle\". Nevertheless, the issues identified in the report cropped up time and time again in Carbon Brief's interviews with experts.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious impact of this language barrier is in group meetings, when experts must express their ideas to one another in English. The IPCC gender taskforce report finds that only 76% of respondents agreed that those who did not speak or write English well were treated with respect, while only 65% agreed that people from developing countries were able to fully contribute. It adds:\n\n\"Several respondents reported seeing themselves or colleagues be brushed aside owing to a lack of fluency in English, or to youth, race, gender or being from developing countries.\"\n\nRoberts tells Carbon Brief that \"English is the language of science\". Therefore, she adds, \"that the global south and majority world participants are coming in often with English as a second, third, fourth or fifth language is a challenge\".\n\nSaheb tells Carbon Brief that the English language can also prevent experts from citing relevant literature in the report. She notes that the literature cited in IPCC reports is almost exclusively in English and says that experts who write in other languages are not able to bring their literature forward for inclusion in IPCC reports:\n\n\"Officially, you can do it in all UN languages, but in practice, everything is in English... if you are working in your own language, you are out. No one knows what you're doing.\"\n\nHowever, Saheb says the biggest barrier faced by experts in the global south is accessing literature. The IPCC is essentially a synthesis of literature, so it is crucial to have access to the latest papers. However, many journals have paywalls in place and only allow institutions who can pay a subscription to access their articles, Saheb says. She adds:\n\n\"You have to pay for it. It's really very expensive. And in the global north, universities pay for it... The richer the country and the richer your university, the better your access to all the publications.\"\n\nSaheb notes that the IPCC does provide access for some experts through UNEP, but says that it is \"very complicated to have access\" through this process. She concludes:\n\n\"The IPCC must look for funding to give full access to all these databases, to anyone from the south who has been selected to contribute to the IPCC access during the duration of the full cycle.\"\n\nMany experts interviewed by Carbon Brief also highlighted cultural differences that can make group communication difficult. For example, Roberts explained that \"for some cultures, standing up and dominating conversation is inappropriate, so people come into the room and they're not forcefully taking the floor\".\n\nSimilarly, Saheb jokes:\n\n\"My generation learned that you speak only if you are sure about which way you have to say. But this is not the case if you are American and you learn to speak all the time.\"\n\nDr Prabir Patra is a researcher at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and was selected as a WG1 lead author. He has lived in Japan for 20 years, but still has an Indian accent from his time growing up there and says that people find it easier to understand British and American accents than his own.\n\nHe adds that humour is different between countries, commenting that participants from Japan \"do not speak much\" and often \"don't get involved in the jokes\" made in international meetings.\n\nMasson-Delmotte explains that she saw tensions she saw in early WG1 meetings:\n\n\"People growing up in the US or Europe, for instance, are very familiar with horizontal brainstorming. When you start to work to get to know each other, you express yourself. You take the floor. Sometimes you should disagree with a facilitator or coordinating lead authors and you don't hesitate to say. In other cultures, this is perceived to be rude. You are expected to wait until you're given the floor...This is typically the case in cultures such as in Asia.\"\n\nShe decided to hire a company to provide \"support training to enhance inclusion and participation for all authors\". She tells Carbon Brief that the training was \"very useful\" and suggests that it should become mandatory for all IPCC bureau members at least.\n\nShe adds:\n\n\"Unconscious biases are present even if you select the brightest scientists. We are all humans and we are not all trained to work in a multicultural context.\"\n\nLack of support, funding and expertise from global south institutions is another common theme. \"Science, like everything, requires resources and support, and in societies where resources are more scarce and less abundant, science doesn't get the kind of support that it needs,\" Roberts tells Carbon Brief.\n\nLa Rovere is a Brazilian climate expert, but tells Carbon Brief that he got his PhD in France, and first became involved in climate change research through his French colleagues. He recalls that global south countries were less involved in initial climate research for a range of reasons - including a \"general feeling in the global south that this was a problem caused by the global north is up to them to fix it\".\n\nWhen he began work with the IPCC in 1982, there was limited expertise about climate change in Brazil, La Rovere says. As such, he recalls that he received limited support and funding:\n\n\"I had this joke with my fellow IPCC colleagues from the north that climate change for me was a hobby, not actually a professional activity because I got no funding at all from Brazilian sources during the IPCC.\"\n\nHowever, Patra tells Carbon Brief that \"participants from global south are almost always funded by IPCC in full or partially\". He adds:\n\n\"Once the lead authors for the assessment report are selected, the IPCC or World Meteorological Organisation generously support the people from the global south.\n\n\"Also for other international meetings held elsewhere, the people from middle income countries, such as India, are often financially supported by the organisers. People from lower income countries do not apply for attendance as climate research is a luxury topic for them to invest in.\"\n\nThe lack of diversity in the IPCC reflects a broader lack of diversity in academia and also mirrors the demographic of climate experts at UN negotiations. However, this analysis shows that diversity is improving.\n\nMasson-Delmotte also tells Carbon Brief why diversity is important in the IPCC:\n\n\"The sharper you want the assessment, the better it is to have a more diverse group. Because then you are more open to not knowing the scientific literature in all regions. The more you avoid boys clubs approaches - the group thinking that develops within a given community. It can be challenged when you open more to diverse perspectives. And even for the physics of climate this applies.\"\n\nRoberts says:\n\n\"I think we have become so focused on the science and the carbon and the temperatures that we potentially lost sight of the people who generate that important information. IPCC authors do need an environment which is respectful of diversity and differences, to create a working space that allows that diversity, which is such a strength in the IPCC process, to actually impact on the outcomes of the assessment cycle.\"\n\nBarrett adds:\n\n\"Getting the numbers up is important. There is strength in numbers. But we also need to create an inclusive environment so that women, scientists from the global south, scientists who don't speak English as a first language all feel welcome and invited to fully contribute.\n\n\"There are many ways to do a job well. We just need to bring our own authenticity to the work and, sometimes, we find a better way to do things.\"\n\nCarbon Brief contacted the IPCC press team for a response to the comments made in this article, but at the time of publishing have not heard back.\n\nBack to top\n\nData was compiled by the IPCC secretariat over multiple years. Raw data for the first four assessment cycles was compiled in 2017, while data for the fifth and sixth assessment cycles were compiled in 2019.\n\nSarah Connors from the AR6 WG1 technical support unit shared this data with Carbon Brief - as well as, separately, the most up-to-date version of the AR6 SYR data. Diana Liverman and Miriam Gay Antaki, from the IPCC gender taskforce, provided Carbon Brief with an update to this data, which filled in many of the gender gaps - which were especially prevalent in early reports - using online research.\n\nThere are still some gaps in the data, which gets more complete in later reports. For example, the role of IPCC authors (lead author, coordinating lead author or review editor) were only noted down from AR4.\n\nFurthermore, the FAR, published in 1990, had a different structure to the rest of the reports, and listed the vast majority of authors as lead authors, so is not included in analysis of author roles. Furthermore, the IPCC secretariat has advised that FAR, SAR and TAR data may be less reliable than more recent data, as no proper records were kept by the secretariat at the time. This is reflected in the fact that gender and country are unknown for some authors in earlier reports\n\nFurthermore, the distinction between \"country\" and \"nationality\" is only made from AR5 onwards. In earlier reports, only \"country\" is listed - and so this metric is used for the majority of the data analysis. In earlier reports, some authors had two entries for \"country\", separated by a semicolon. Based on context, Carbon Brief has taken the first to be the author's \"country\" - indicating where the expert's institution is based - and the second to be their \"citizenship\".\n\nAuthor data from synthesis reports were not provided by the IPCC, so Carbon Brief manually collected this data. Where a synthesis report author had also contributed to another report, data on gender and country could be extrapolated. Data on institutions were only extrapolated if another entry from the same assessment cycle could be found, as experts are likely to move between different institutions between the different assessment cycles.\n\nRepeats - for example, if one person contributed to a working group report and a synthesis report in the same assessment cycle - were removed from the dataset in some instances. Carbon Brief uses the word \"authors\" to indicate unique authors, and the word \"contributors\" to indicate the occurrence of repeats in the dataset.\n\nData from special reports prior to the AR5 assessment cycle are not included in this analysis, as they were not analysed by the IPCC secretariat, and were deemed too lengthy for manual analysis by Carbon Brief.\n\nIn this piece, \"global north\" is defined as countries in North America, Europe and Oceania, while \"global south\" is countries in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa.",

But the report cautioned achieving this goal will require \"unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions must drop 43 percent by 2030 - and 84 percent by mid-century - to stay within the threshold. Yet emissions have continued to rise. The world is likely to overshoot the 1.5C limit, even if temporarily.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree counts. At 1.5C of warming, 14 percent of terrestrial species will face an extinction risk. If temperatures rise by 2C, 99 percent of warm-water coral reefs - home to one-quarter of marine life - will perish and staple food crops will decline.\n\nThe IPCC reports emphasise as never before the danger of \"tipping points\" - temperature thresholds in the climate system that could, once cro ...",

                    "body": "Hitting the 2015 Paris Agreement temperature goals will require a massive reduction in fossil fuel use and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society, IPCC reports say.\n\nEarth is hotter than it has been in 125,000 years but deadly heatwaves, storms and floods amplified by global warming could be a foretaste as planet-heating fossil fuels put a \"liveable\" future at risk.\n\nSo concludes the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that started a weeklong meeting to distil six landmark reports totalling 10,000 pages prepared by more than 1,000 scientists over the last six years.\n\nHere are some of the main findings from those reports:\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement called for capping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the late-19th century levels.\n\nHowever, a landmark IPCC report in 2018 left no doubt: only the treaty's more ambitious aspirational limit of 1.5C (2.7F) could ensure a climate-safe world. But the report cautioned achieving this goal will require \"unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions must drop 43 percent by 2030 - and 84 percent by mid-century - to stay within the threshold. Yet emissions have continued to rise. The world is likely to overshoot the 1.5C limit, even if temporarily.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree counts. At 1.5C of warming, 14 percent of terrestrial species will face an extinction risk. If temperatures rise by 2C, 99 percent of warm-water coral reefs - home to one-quarter of marine life - will perish and staple food crops will decline.\n\nThe IPCC reports emphasise as never before the danger of \"tipping points\" - temperature thresholds in the climate system that could, once crossed, result in catastrophic and irreversible change.\n\nThe Amazon basin, for example, is already morphing from tropical forest to savannah.\n\nWarming between 1.5C and 2C could push Arctic Sea ice, methane-laden permafrost, and ice sheets with enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen metres past points of no return.\n\nThe 2022 IPCC report on effects - described by UN chief Antonio Guterres as an \"atlas of human suffering\" - catalogued the enormous challenges ahead for humanity.\n\nBetween 3.3 and 3.6 billion people are \"highly vulnerable\" to global warming's effects, including deadly heatwaves, drought, water shortages, and disease-carrying mosquitos and ticks.\n\nClimate change has adversely affected physical health worldwide, and mental health in regions where data is available.\n\nBy 2050, many flood-vulnerable coastal megacities and small island nations will experience what were formerly once-a-century weather disasters every year.\n\nThese and other effects are set to become worse, and will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable populations, including Indigenous peoples.\n\n\"The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health,\" said the IPCC impacts report last year.\n\nFurther delays in cutting carbon pollution and preparing for impacts already in the pipeline \"will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all\".\n\nFortunately, forests, plants and soil absorb and store nearly one-third of all human-made emissions. But intensive exploitation of these natural resources also generates planet-warming CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Agriculture consumes 70 percent of Earth's freshwater supply.\n\nOceans have kept the planet liveable by absorbing one-quarter of human-made CO2 and soaking up more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gases.\n\nBut this has come at a cost: seas have grown acidic, potentially undermining their capacity to draw down CO2, and warmer surface water has expanded the force and range of deadly tropical storms.\n\nAll roads leading to a liveable world \"involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors\", including transport, agriculture, energy and cities, the IPCC concluded.\n\nMeeting the Paris temperature goals will require a massive reduction in fossil fuel use, the IPCC said.\n\nCoal-fired power plants that do not deploy carbon capture technology to siphon off CO2 pollution must decline by 70 to 90 percent within eight years. By 2050, the world must be carbon neutral, compensating any residual emissions with removals from the atmosphere.\n\nThe world must also tackle methane (CH4), the IPCC warns. The second most important atmospheric pollutant after CO2 comes from leaks in fossil fuel production and agriculture, as well as natural sources such as wetlands.\n\nMethane levels are their highest in at least two million years.\n\nThe good news, the IPCC stressed, is alternatives to planet-heating fuels have become significantly cheaper. From 2010 to 2019, the unit costs of solar energy fell 85 percent, while wind power costs dropped 55 percent.\n\n\"It's now or never if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C,\" said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report on cutting emissions last year.",

                    "body": "PARIS: Diplomats from nearly 200 nations and top climate scientists began a week-long huddle in Switzerland on Monday to distil nearly a decade of published science into a 20-odd-page warning about the existential danger of global warming and what to do about it.\n\nThe United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis report -- to be released on March 20 -- will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth towards an unliveable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, said.\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC -- an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of scientists who work for it on a volunteer basis -- has released six three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022. \"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\nCarbon budgets\n\nThis warming, the IPCC has concluded, is overwhelmingly caused by burning oil, gas and coal. In a video message on Monday UN secretary general Antonio Guterres urged world leaders who will gather in December at the COP28 climate summit \"to accelerate the phasing out of fossil fuels\".\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise in the planet's average temperature at \"well below\" 2C, and at 1.5C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope. Humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, said.",

                    "body": "For: Opening ceremony of the 58th Session of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n\nThe assessment report by Working Group I told us that climate change is here, now, and intensifying. This is indisputable. The assessment report by Working Group II told us that climate change is a threat to human well-being and the health of the planet, which are one and the same. This is indisputable. The assessment report by Working Group III told us that we are still not doing enough to cut greenhouse gas emissions - leaving us on track to far exceed the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement. This is indisputable.\n\nEven though the international response is not yet strong or fast enough - on adaptation or mitigation - the IPCC's science has made a difference. IPCC reports have historically influenced climate change negotiations. The Sixth Assessment reports and special reports influenced decisions at the climate negotiations in Glasgow and Sharm el-Sheikh - and indeed decisions in government offices and boardrooms across the world.\n\nThe Sixth Assessment reports fed into the first and second step of the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement. We look forward to the third and final step of the first Global Stocktake, which will take place at COP28 in the United Arab Emirates. The IPCC's input on this final step of the world's collective progress towards achieving the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement will set the tone for action in the second half of this critical decade.\n\nMake no mistake, action is the key word here. We need more action from governments, businesses and investors - indeed everyone. The IPCC's work, which chimes with UNEP's own research, tells us that we have the knowledge and technology we need. That we can start slashing emissions and helping vulnerable communities adapt to climate change. And that by acting on climate, we are also acting on nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste - the other two prongs of the triple planetary crisis.\n\nMy thanks to the IPCC Chair, Executive Committee, Bureau, authors and Secretariat for their hard work during the sixth assessment cycle. I wish you a productive week and successful approval of the Synthesis Report and look forward to seeing you in person in Nairobi this July, when UNEP hosts the 59th session of the IPCC.",

                    "body": "So concludes the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which started a week-long meeting Monday to distill six landmark reports totalling 10,000 pages prepared by more than 1,000 scientists over the last six years.\n\nHere are some of the main findings from those reports:\n\n- 1.5C or 2C? -\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement called for capping global warming well below two degrees Celsius compared to late-19th century levels.\n\nBut a landmark IPCC report in 2018 left no doubt: only the treaty's more ambitious aspirational limit of 1.5C could ensure a climate-safe world.\n\nBut the report cautioned that achieving this goal will require \"unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions must drop 43 percent by 2030 -- and 84 percent by mid-century -- to stay within the threshold.\n\nAnd yet, emissions have continued to rise. The world is very likely to overshoot the 1.5C limit, even if temporarily.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree counts.\n\nAt 1.5C of warming, 14 percent of terrestrial species will face an extinction risk.\n\nIf temperatures rise to 2C, 99 percent of warm-water coral reefs -- home to a quarter of marine life -- will perish, and staple food crops will decline.\n\nThe IPCC reports emphasise as never before the danger of \"tipping points\", temperature thresholds in the climate system that could, once crossed, result in catastrophic and irreversible change.\n\nThe Amazon basin, for example, is already morphing from tropical forest to savannah.\n\nWarming between 1.5C and 2C could push Arctic sea ice, methane-laden permafrost, and ice sheets with enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen metres past points of no return.\n\n- Avalanche of suffering -\n\nThe 2022 IPCC report on impacts -- described by UN chief Antonio Guterres as an \"atlas of human suffering\" -- catalogued the enormous challenges ahead for humanity.\n\nBetween 3.3 and 3.6 billion are \"highly vulnerable\" to global warming's effects, including deadly heatwaves, drought, water shortages, and disease-carrying mosquitos and ticks.\n\nClimate change has adversely affected physical health worldwide, and mental health in regions where data is available.\n\nBy 2050, many flood-vulnerable coastal megacities and small island nations will experience what were formerly once-a-century weather disasters every year.\n\nThese and other impacts are set to become worse, and will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples.\n\n\"The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health,\" said the IPCC impacts report last year.\n\nFurther delays in cutting carbon pollution and preparing for impacts already in the pipeline \"will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\"\n\n- Ecosystems on the edge -\n\nFortunately for us, forests, plants and soil absorb and store nearly one third of all human-made emissions.\n\nBut intensive exploitation of these natural resources also generates planet-warming CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Agriculture consumes 70 percent of Earth's freshwater supply.\n\nOceans have kept the planet liveable by absorbing a quarter of human-made CO2 and soaking up more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gases.\n\nBut this has come at a cost: seas have grown acidic, potentially undermining their capacity to draw down CO2, and warmer surface water has expanded the force and range of deadly tropical storms.\n\n- Fossil fuels -\n\nAll roads leading to a liveable world \"involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors\", including industry, transportation, agriculture, energy and cities, the IPCC concluded.\n\nHitting the Paris temperature goals will require a massive reduction in fossil fuel use, the IPCC says.\n\nCoal-fired power plants that do not deploy carbon capture technology to syphon off CO2 pollution must decline by 70 to 90 percent within eight years. By 2050, the world must be carbon neutral, compensating any residual emissions with removals from the atmosphere.\n\nThe world must also tackle methane (CH4), the IPCC warns. The second most important atmospheric pollutant after CO2 comes from leaks in fossil fuel production and agriculture, as well as natural sources such as wetlands.\n\nCH4 levels are their highest in at least two million years.\n\nThe good news, the IPCC stresses, is that the alternatives to planet-heating fuels have become significantly cheaper. From 2010 to 2019, the unit costs of solar energy fell 85 percent, while wind power dropped 55 percent.\n\n\"It's now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C,\" said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report on cutting emissions last year.",

Guterres said world leaders are simply not doing enough to address global warming issues.\n\n\"We are nearing the point of no return; of overshooting the internationally agreed limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming,\" Guterres said. \"We are at the tip of a tipping point. But it is not too late -- as you have shown.\"\n\nGuterres said the IPCC showed in its report last year, covering where the world pulled back on travel and use of fossil fuels because of the COVID-19 pandemic, that it is a realistic goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees with rapid and deep emissions reductions across all global sectors.\n\n\"Your recent reports have also underscored the need to act now,\" Guterres said. \"In 2021, you concluded for the first time that some of the changes to Earth's oceans, ice and land surface were irreversible.\n\n\"These changes were 'unequivocally' caused by human activity, overwhelmingly due to burning fossil fuels and creating unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases. In 2022, you showed that nearly half the global population is living in the danger zone of climate impacts and that we must scale up investments in adaptation.\"\n\nDuring the meeting, the IPCC will review its Summary for Policymakers line by line and adopt its Synthesis Report to the Sixth Assessment Report.\n\n\"Once approved, the Synthesis Report will become a fundamental policy document for shaping climate action in the remainder of this pivotal decade,\" IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee said in a statement.\n\n\"For policymakers of today and tomorrow, a much-needed textbook for addressing climate change. Make no mistake, inaction and delays are not listed as options.\"\n\nIPCC: the climate handbook for a 'liveable' future\n\nParis (AFP) March 13, 2023 - Earth is hotter than it has been in 125,000 years, but deadly heatwaves, storms and floods amplified by global warming could be but a foretaste as planet-heating fossil fuels put a \"liveable\" future at risk.\n\nSo concludes the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which started a week-long meeting Monday to distill six landmark reports totalling 10,000 pages prepared by more than 1,000 scientists over the last six years.\n\nHere are some of the main findings from those reports:\n\n- 1.5C or 2C? -\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement called for capping global warming well below two degrees Celsius compared to late-19th century levels.\n\nBut a landmark IPCC report in 2018 left no doubt: only the treaty's more ambitious aspirational limit of 1.5C could ensure a climate-safe world.\n\nBut the report cautioned that achieving this goal will require \"unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions must drop 43 percent by 2030 -- and 84 percent by mid-century -- to stay within the threshold.\n\nAnd yet, emissions have continued to rise. The world is very likely to overshoot the 1.5C limit, even if temporarily.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree counts.\n\nAt 1.5C of warming, 14 percent of terrestrial species will face an extinction risk.\n\nIf temperatures rise to 2C, 99 percent of warm-water coral reefs -- home to a quarter of marine life -- will perish, and staple food crops will decline.\n\nThe IPCC reports emphasise as never before the danger of \"tipping points\", temperature thresholds in the climate system that could, once crossed, result in catastrophic and irreversible change.\n\nThe Amazon basin, for example, is already morphing from tropical forest to savannah.\n\nWarming between 1.5C and 2C could push Arctic sea ice, methane-laden permafrost, and ice sheets with enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen metres past points of no return.\n\n- Avalanche of suffering -\n\nThe 2022 IPCC report on impacts -- described by UN chief Antonio Guterres as an \"atlas of human suffering\" -- catalogued the enormous challenges ahead for humanity.\n\nBetween 3.3 and 3.6 billion are \"highly vulnerable\" to global warming's effects, including deadly heatwaves, drought, water shortages, and disease-carrying mosquitos and ticks.\n\nClimate change has adversely affected physical health worldwide, and mental health in regions where data is available.\n\nBy 2050, many flood-vulnerable coastal megacities and small island nations will experience what were formerly once-a-century weather disasters every year.\n\nThese and other impacts are set to become worse, and will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples.\n\n\"The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health,\" said the IPCC impacts report last year.\n\nFurther delays in cutting carbon pollution and preparing for impacts already in the pipeline \"will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\"\n\n- Ecosystems on the edge -\n\nFortunately for us, forests, plants and soil absorb and store nearly one third of all human-made emissions.\n\nBut intensive exploitation of these natural resources also generates planet-warming CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Agriculture consumes 70 percent of Earth's freshwater supply.\n\nOceans have kept the planet liveable by absorbing a quarter of human-made CO2 and soaking up more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gases.\n\nBut this has come at a cost: seas have grown acidic, potentially undermining their capacity to draw down CO2, and warmer surface water has expanded the force and range of deadly tropical storms.\n\n- Fossil fuels -\n\nAll roads leading to a liveable world \"involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors\", including industry, transportation, agriculture, energy and cities, the IPCC concluded.\n\nHitting the Paris temperature goals will require a massive reduction in fossil fuel use, the IPCC says.\n\nCoal-fired power plants that do not deploy carbon capture technology to syphon off CO2 pollution must decline by 70 to 90 percent within eight years. By 2050, the world must be carbon neutral, compensating any residual emissions with removals from the atmosphere.\n\nThe world must also tackle methane (CH4), the IPCC warns. The second most important atmospheric pollutant after CO2 comes from leaks in fossil fuel production and agriculture, as well as natural sources such as wetlands.\n\nCH4 levels are their highest in at least two million years.\n\nThe good news, the IPCC stresses, is that the alternatives to planet-heating fuels have become significantly cheaper. From 2010 to 2019, the unit costs of solar energy fell 85 percent, while wind power dropped 55 percent.\n\n\"It's now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C,\" said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report on cutting emissions last year.",

The world is very likely to overshoot the 1.5C limit, even if temporarily.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree counts.\n\nAt 1.5C of warming, 14 percent of terrestrial species will face an extinction risk.\n\nIf temperatures rise to 2C, 99 percent of warm-water coral reefs -- home to a quarter of marine life -- will perish, and staple food crops will decline.\n\nThe IPCC reports emphasise as never before the danger of \"tipping points\", temperature thresholds in the climate system that could, once crossed, result in catastrophic and irreversible change.\n\nThe Amazon basin, for example, is already morphing from tropical forest to savannah.\n\nWarming between 1.5C and 2C could push Arctic sea ice, methane-laden permafrost, and ice sheets with enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen metres past points of no return.\n\nThe 2022 IPCC report on impacts -- described by UN chief Antonio Guterres as an \"atlas of human suffering\" -- catalogued the enormous challenges ahead for humanity.\n\nBetween 3.3 and 3.6 billion are \"highly vulnerable\" to global warming's effects, including deadly heatwaves, drought, water shortages, and disease-carrying mosquitos and ticks.\n\nClimate change has adversely affected physical health worldwide, and mental health in regions where data is available.\n\nBy 2050, many flood-vulnerable coastal megacities and small island nations will experience what were formerly once-a-century weather disasters every year.\n\nThese and other impacts are set to become worse, and will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples.\n\n\"The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health,\" said the IPCC impacts report last year.\n\nFurther delays in cutting carbon pollution and preparing for impacts already in the pipeline \"will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\" Fortunately for us, forests, plants and soil absorb and store nearly one third of all human-made emissions.\n\nBut intensive exploitation of these natural resources also generates planet-warming CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Agriculture consumes 70 percent of Earth's freshwater supply.\n\nOceans have kept the planet liveable by absorbing a quarter of human-made CO2 and soaking up more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gases.\n\nBut this has come at a cost: seas have grown acidic, potentially undermining their capacity to draw down CO2, and warmer surface water has expanded the force and range of deadly tropical storms.\n\n\"It's now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C,\" said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report on cutting emissions last year.",

                    "body": "PARIS - Earth is hotter than it has been in 125,000 years, but deadly heatwaves, storms and floods amplified by global warming could be but a foretaste as planet-heating fossil fuels put a \"liveable\" future at risk.\n\nSo concludes the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which started a week-long meeting on Monday to distill six landmark reports totalling 10,000 pages prepared by more than 1,000 scientists over the past six years.\n\nHere are some of the main findings from those reports:\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement called for capping global warming well below two degrees Celsius compared to late-19th century levels.\n\nBut a landmark IPCC report in 2018 left no doubt: only the treaty's more ambitious aspirational limit of 1.5 deg C could ensure a climate-safe world.\n\nBut the report cautioned that achieving this goal will require \"unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions must drop 43 per cent by 2030 - and 84 per cent by mid-century - to stay within the threshold.\n\nAnd yet, emissions have continued to rise. The world is very likely to overshoot the 1.5 C limit, even if temporarily.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree counts.\n\nAt 1.5 deg C of warming, 14 per cent of terrestrial species will face an extinction risk.\n\nIf temperatures rise to 2 deg C, 99 per cent of warm-water coral reefs - home to a quarter of marine life - will perish, and staple food crops will decline.\n\nThe IPCC reports emphasise as never before the danger of \"tipping points\", temperature thresholds in the climate system that could, once crossed, result in catastrophic and irreversible change.\n\nThe Amazon basin, for example, is already morphing from tropical forest to savannah.\n\nWarming between 1.5 C and 2 C could push Arctic sea ice, methane-laden permafrost, and ice sheets with enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen metres past points of no return.",

                    "body": "The latest report is the most damning yet so we've charted three decades of Australia's climate policy to gauge our progress, or lack of it.\n\nThe UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released its third report in its sixth assessment series on the status of climate change science, impacts and mitigation. It found that even if all policies announced by governments across the world were fully implemented, the earth would still warmer by 3.2\u2103 degrees by 2100.\n\nThe science suggests warming to this extent would see unprecedented weather events and water shortages causing devastation. In some of the strongest wording used to date, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said: \"Some government and business leaders are saying one thing but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.\"\n\nThese findings add to the mounting evidence the IPCC has compiled over the past three decades, and the urgency grows with the release of each report. But what is Australia's record of responding to climate science? Crikey looks back on its response to successive reports.",

                    "body": "PARIS: Diplomats from nearly 200 nations and top climate scientists begin a weeklong huddle in Switzerland Monday to distill nearly a decade of published science into a 20-odd-page warning about the existential danger of global warming, and what to do about it.\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) synthesis report -- to be released on March 20 -- will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heat waves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unlivable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, told Agence France-Presse (AFP).\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC -- an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of volunteer scientists -- has released six, three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times' daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nThe report card is not good: global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\nCarbon budgets\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise at \"well below\" 2 C, and at 1.5 C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope: humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5 C barrier is less than 300 billion tons of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of the report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nUnveiled ahead of COP28 UN climate talks in Dubai in December, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8 C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\n'More politicized'\n\nEven in a 1.8 C world -- an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists -- half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system and economic productivity.\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet -- our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nFloods last year that covered a third of Pakistan, and ongoing drought in East Africa, both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect the debate over the best way to decarbonize the global economy, with some emphasizing the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line-by-line cannot change the science in the underlying reports' 10,750 pages, but they can decide what to leave in or out, and can highlight -- or obscure -- things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicized as government representatives -- mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states -- interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future,\" the journal said.",

                    "body": "Earth is hotter than it has been in 125,000 years, but deadly heatwaves, storms and floods amplified by global warming could be but a foretaste as planet-heating fossil fuels put a \"liveable\" future at risk.\n\nSo concludes the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which started a week-long meeting Monday to distill six landmark reports totalling 10,000 pages prepared by more than 1,000 scientists over the last six years.\n\nHere are some of the main findings from those reports:\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement called for capping global warming well below two degrees Celsius compared to late-19th century levels.\n\nBut a landmark IPCC report in 2018 left no doubt: only the treaty's more ambitious aspirational limit of 1.5C could ensure a climate-safe world.\n\nBut the report cautioned that achieving this goal will require \"unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions must drop 43 percent by 2030 -- and 84 percent by mid-century -- to stay within the threshold.\n\nAnd yet, emissions have continued to rise. The world is very likely to overshoot the 1.5C limit, even if temporarily.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree counts.\n\nAt 1.5C of warming, 14 percent of terrestrial species will face an extinction risk.\n\nIf temperatures rise to 2C, 99 percent of warm-water coral reefs -- home to a quarter of marine life -- will perish, and staple food crops will decline.\n\nThe IPCC reports emphasize as never before the danger of \"tipping points\", temperature thresholds in the climate system that could, once crossed, result in catastrophic and irreversible change.\n\nThe Amazon basin, for example, is already morphing from tropical forest to savannah.\n\nWarming between 1.5C and 2C could push Arctic sea ice, methane-laden permafrost, and ice sheets with enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen meters past points of no return.\n\nThe 2022 IPCC report on impacts -- described by UN chief Antonio Guterres as an \"atlas of human suffering\" -- catalogued the enormous challenges ahead for humanity.\n\nBetween 3.3 and 3.6 billion are \"highly vulnerable\" to global warming's effects, including deadly heatwaves, drought, water shortages, and disease-carrying mosquitos and ticks.\n\nClimate change has adversely affected physical health worldwide, and mental health in regions where data is available.\n\nBy 2050, many flood-vulnerable coastal megacities and small island nations will experience what were formerly once-a-century weather disasters every year.\n\nThese and other impacts are set to become worse, and will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples.\n\n\"The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health,\" said the IPCC impacts report last year.\n\nFurther delays in cutting carbon pollution and preparing for impacts already in the pipeline \"will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\"\n\nFortunately for us, forests, plants and soil absorb and store nearly one third of all human-made emissions.\n\nBut intensive exploitation of these natural resources also generates planet-warming CO, methane and nitrous oxide. Agriculture consumes 70 percent of Earth's freshwater supply.\n\nOceans have kept the planet liveable by absorbing a quarter of human-made CO and soaking up more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gases.\n\nBut this has come at a cost: seas have grown acidic, potentially undermining their capacity to draw down CO, and warmer surface water has expanded the force and range of deadly tropical storms.\n\nAll roads leading to a liveable world \"involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors\", including industry, transportation, agriculture, energy and cities, the IPCC concluded.\n\nHitting the Paris temperature goals will require a massive reduction in fossil fuel use, the IPCC says.\n\nCoal-fired power plants that do not deploy carbon capture technology to siphon off CO pollution must decline by 70 to 90 percent within eight years. By 2050, the world must be carbon neutral, compensating any residual emissions with removals from the atmosphere.\n\nThe world must also tackle methane (CH), the IPCC warns. The second most important atmospheric pollutant after CO comes from leaks in fossil fuel production and agriculture, as well as natural sources such as wetlands.\n\nCH4 levels are their highest in at least two million years.\n\nThe good news, the IPCC stresses, is that the alternatives to planet-heating fuels have become significantly cheaper. From 2010 to 2019, the unit costs of solar energy fell 85 percent, while wind power dropped 55 percent.\n\n\"It's now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C,\" said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report on cutting emissions last year.",

                    "body": "Earth is hotter than it has been in 125,000 years, but deadly heatwaves, storms and floods amplified by global warming could be but a foretaste as planet-heating fossil fuels put a \"liveable\" future at risk.\n\nSo concludes the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which started a week-long meeting Monday to distill six landmark reports totalling 10,000 pages prepared by more than 1,000 scientists over the last six years.\n\nHere are some of the main findings from those reports:\n\n- 1.5C or 2C? -\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement called for capping global warming well below two degrees Celsius compared to late-19th century levels.\n\nBut a landmark IPCC report in 2018 left no doubt: only the treaty's more ambitious aspirational limit of 1.5C could ensure a climate-safe world.\n\nBut the report cautioned that achieving this goal will require \"unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions must drop 43 percent by 2030 -- and 84 percent by mid-century -- to stay within the threshold.\n\nAnd yet, emissions have continued to rise. The world is very likely to overshoot the 1.5C limit, even if temporarily.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree counts.\n\nAt 1.5C of warming, 14 percent of terrestrial species will face an extinction risk.\n\nIf temperatures rise to 2C, 99 percent of warm-water coral reefs -- home to a quarter of marine life -- will perish, and staple food crops will decline.\n\nThe IPCC reports emphasise as never before the danger of \"tipping points\", temperature thresholds in the climate system that could, once crossed, result in catastrophic and irreversible change.\n\nThe Amazon basin, for example, is already morphing from tropical forest to savannah.\n\nWarming between 1.5C and 2C could push Arctic sea ice, methane-laden permafrost, and ice sheets with enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen metres past points of no return.\n\n- Avalanche of suffering -\n\nThe 2022 IPCC report on impacts -- described by UN chief Antonio Guterres as an \"atlas of human suffering\" -- catalogued the enormous challenges ahead for humanity.\n\nBetween 3.3 and 3.6 billion are \"highly vulnerable\" to global warming's effects, including deadly heatwaves, drought, water shortages, and disease-carrying mosquitos and ticks.\n\nClimate change has adversely affected physical health worldwide, and mental health in regions where data is available.\n\nBy 2050, many flood-vulnerable coastal megacities and small island nations will experience what were formerly once-a-century weather disasters every year.\n\nThese and other impacts are set to become worse, and will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples.\n\n\"The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health,\" said the IPCC impacts report last year.\n\nFurther delays in cutting carbon pollution and preparing for impacts already in the pipeline \"will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\"\n\n- Ecosystems on the edge -\n\nFortunately for us, forests, plants and soil absorb and store nearly one third of all human-made emissions.\n\nBut intensive exploitation of these natural resources also generates planet-warming CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Agriculture consumes 70 percent of Earth's freshwater supply.\n\nOceans have kept the planet liveable by absorbing a quarter of human-made CO2 and soaking up more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gases.\n\nBut this has come at a cost: seas have grown acidic, potentially undermining their capacity to draw down CO2, and warmer surface water has expanded the force and range of deadly tropical storms.\n\n- Fossil fuels -\n\nAll roads leading to a liveable world \"involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors\", including industry, transportation, agriculture, energy and cities, the IPCC concluded.\n\nHitting the Paris temperature goals will require a massive reduction in fossil fuel use, the IPCC says.\n\nCoal-fired power plants that do not deploy carbon capture technology to syphon off CO2 pollution must decline by 70 to 90 percent within eight years. By 2050, the world must be carbon neutral, compensating any residual emissions with removals from the atmosphere.\n\nThe world must also tackle methane (CH4), the IPCC warns. The second most important atmospheric pollutant after CO2 comes from leaks in fossil fuel production and agriculture, as well as natural sources such as wetlands.\n\nCH4 levels are their highest in at least two million years.\n\nThe good news, the IPCC stresses, is that the alternatives to planet-heating fuels have become significantly cheaper. From 2010 to 2019, the unit costs of solar energy fell 85 percent, while wind power dropped 55 percent.\n\n\"It's now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C,\" said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report on cutting emissions last year.",

                    "body": "The IPCC started a week-long meeting to distill six landmark reports totalling 10,000 pages prepared by more than 1,000 scientists - Copyright AFP Aris Messinis\n\nEarth is hotter than it has been in 125,000 years, but deadly heatwaves, storms and floods amplified by global warming could be but a foretaste as planet-heating fossil fuels put a \"liveable\" future at risk.\n\nSo concludes the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which started a week-long meeting Monday to distill six landmark reports totalling 10,000 pages prepared by more than 1,000 scientists over the last six years.\n\nHere are some of the main findings from those reports:\n\n- 1.5C or 2C? -\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement called for capping global warming well below two degrees Celsius compared to late-19th century levels.\n\nBut a landmark IPCC report in 2018 left no doubt: only the treaty's more ambitious aspirational limit of 1.5C could ensure a climate-safe world.\n\nBut the report cautioned that achieving this goal will require \"unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions must drop 43 percent by 2030 -- and 84 percent by mid-century -- to stay within the threshold.\n\nAnd yet, emissions have continued to rise. The world is very likely to overshoot the 1.5C limit, even if temporarily.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree counts.\n\nAt 1.5C of warming, 14 percent of terrestrial species will face an extinction risk.\n\nIf temperatures rise to 2C, 99 percent of warm-water coral reefs -- home to a quarter of marine life -- will perish, and staple food crops will decline.\n\nThe IPCC reports emphasise as never before the danger of \"tipping points\", temperature thresholds in the climate system that could, once crossed, result in catastrophic and irreversible change.\n\nThe Amazon basin, for example, is already morphing from tropical forest to savannah.\n\nWarming between 1.5C and 2C could push Arctic sea ice, methane-laden permafrost, and ice sheets with enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen metres past points of no return.\n\n- Avalanche of suffering -\n\nThe 2022 IPCC report on impacts -- described by UN chief Antonio Guterres as an \"atlas of human suffering\" -- catalogued the enormous challenges ahead for humanity.\n\nBetween 3.3 and 3.6 billion are \"highly vulnerable\" to global warming's effects, including deadly heatwaves, drought, water shortages, and disease-carrying mosquitos and ticks.\n\nClimate change has adversely affected physical health worldwide, and mental health in regions where data is available.\n\nBy 2050, many flood-vulnerable coastal megacities and small island nations will experience what were formerly once-a-century weather disasters every year.\n\nThese and other impacts are set to become worse, and will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples.\n\n\"The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health,\" said the IPCC impacts report last year.\n\nFurther delays in cutting carbon pollution and preparing for impacts already in the pipeline \"will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\"\n\n- Ecosystems on the edge -\n\nFortunately for us, forests, plants and soil absorb and store nearly one third of all human-made emissions.\n\nBut intensive exploitation of these natural resources also generates planet-warming CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Agriculture consumes 70 percent of Earth's freshwater supply.\n\nOceans have kept the planet liveable by absorbing a quarter of human-made CO2 and soaking up more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gases.\n\nBut this has come at a cost: seas have grown acidic, potentially undermining their capacity to draw down CO2, and warmer surface water has expanded the force and range of deadly tropical storms.\n\n- Fossil fuels -\n\nAll roads leading to a liveable world \"involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors\", including industry, transportation, agriculture, energy and cities, the IPCC concluded.\n\nHitting the Paris temperature goals will require a massive reduction in fossil fuel use, the IPCC says.\n\nCoal-fired power plants that do not deploy carbon capture technology to syphon off CO2 pollution must decline by 70 to 90 percent within eight years. By 2050, the world must be carbon neutral, compensating any residual emissions with removals from the atmosphere.\n\nThe world must also tackle methane (CH4), the IPCC warns. The second most important atmospheric pollutant after CO2 comes from leaks in fossil fuel production and agriculture, as well as natural sources such as wetlands.\n\nCH4 levels are their highest in at least two million years.\n\nThe good news, the IPCC stresses, is that the alternatives to planet-heating fuels have become significantly cheaper. From 2010 to 2019, the unit costs of solar energy fell 85 percent, while wind power dropped 55 percent.\n\n\"It's now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C,\" said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report on cutting emissions last year.",

                    "body": "Diplomats from nearly 200 nations and top climate scientists began a week-long huddle in Switzerland on Monday to distil nearly a decade of published science into a 20-odd-page warning about the existential danger of global warming and what to do about it.\n\nThe United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis report -- to be released on March 20 -- will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unliveable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, told AFP.\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC -- an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of scientists who work for it on a volunteer basis -- has released six three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\n- Carbon budgets -\n\nThis warming, the IPCC has concluded, is overwhelmingly caused by burning oil, gas and coal. In a video message on Monday UN secretary general Antonio Guterres urged world leaders who will gather in December at the COP28 climate summit \"to accelerate the phasing out of fossil fuels\".\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise in the planet's average temperature at \"well below\" 2C, and at 1.5C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope. Humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nTo be unveiled ahead of COP28 in Dubai, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\n- 'More politicised' -\n\nEven in a 1.8C world -- an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists -- half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system and economic productivity.\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet -- our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nFloods last year that covered large swathes of Pakistan and ongoing drought in East Africa both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect debate over the best way to decarbonise the global economy, with some emphasising the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line by line cannot change the science in the underlying 10,750 pages of reports but they can decide what to leave in or out and can highlight -- or obscure -- things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicised as government representatives -- mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states -- interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements ... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future\", the journal said.",

                    "body": "Pakistan is still reeling from flooding in 2022 that was amplified by climate change\n\nDiplomats from nearly 200 nations and top climate scientists began a week-long huddle in Switzerland on Monday to distil nearly a decade of published science into a 20-odd-page warning about the existential danger of global warming and what to do about it.\n\nThe United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis report -- to be released on March 20 -- will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unliveable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, told AFP.\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC -- an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of scientists who work for it on a volunteer basis -- has released six three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions continue to grow, despite scientists warning of the deadly consequences\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\n- Carbon budgets -\n\nThis warming, the IPCC has concluded, is overwhelmingly caused by burning oil, gas and coal. In a video message on Monday UN secretary general Antonio Guterres urged world leaders who will gather in December at the COP28 climate summit \"to accelerate the phasing out of fossil fuels\".\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise in the planet's average temperature at \"well below\" 2C, and at 1.5C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope. Humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nGlobal temperature anomalies by month from 1880 to 2022\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nTo be unveiled ahead of COP28 in Dubai, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\n- 'More politicised' -\n\nEven in a 1.8C world -- an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists -- half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system and economic productivity.\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet -- our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nDecarbonizing the global economy entails rapidly phasing out coal-fired power\n\nFloods last year that covered large swathes of Pakistan and ongoing drought in East Africa both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect debate over the best way to decarbonise the global economy, with some emphasising the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line by line cannot change the science in the underlying 10,750 pages of reports but they can decide what to leave in or out and can highlight -- or obscure -- things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicised as government representatives -- mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states -- interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements ... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future\", the journal said.",

The panel will also adopt the longer report section by section.\n\n\"Once approved, the Synthesis Report, will become a fundamental policy document for shaping climate action in the remainder of this pivotal decade. For policymakers of today and tomorrow, a much-needed textbook for addressing climate change. Make no mistake, inaction and delays are not listed as options,\" said the IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee opening the conference.\n\nOn behalf of the host country, Swiss Federal Councilor Albert R\u00f6sti welcomed over 650 delegates attending this IPCC plenary.\n\n\" The outcomes of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change help us, the policy makers, to take informed decisions on addressing climate change. Science and knowledge must play a central role in shaping our policy-making, guiding us as we work to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change,\" said Mr R\u00f6sti.\n\n\"The evidence put forward by the IPCC for climate change has been clear, convincing and irrefutable. The IPCC must now point the way to solutions so the urgent need to end global heating with cold, hard facts,\" said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\"\n\nVideo messages by Mr Guterres, WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Inger Andersen and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Simon Stiell were also screened at the plenary.\n\n\"I would like to thank all of you for the for the hard work for those reports, which are clearly having a clear message for the decision makers. We need to speed up our climate actions. At the moment, we are heading towards too high warming, and the various impacts of climate change are already very visible worldwide,\" said Prof. Taalas.",

                    "body": "The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis report -- to be released on March 20 -- will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unliveable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, told AFP.\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC -- an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of scientists who work for it on a volunteer basis -- has released six three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\nThis warming, the IPCC has concluded, is overwhelmingly caused by burning oil, gas and coal. In a video message on Monday UN secretary general Antonio Guterres urged world leaders who will gather in December at the COP28 climate summit \"to accelerate the phasing out of fossil fuels\".\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise in the planet's average temperature at \"well below\" 2C, and at 1.5C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope. Humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nTo be unveiled ahead of COP28 in Dubai, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\nEven in a 1.8C world -- an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists -- half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system and economic productivity.\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet -- our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nFloods last year that covered large swathes of Pakistan and ongoing drought in East Africa both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect debate over the best way to decarbonise the global economy, with some emphasising the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line by line cannot change the science in the underlying 10,750 pages of reports but they can decide what to leave in or out and can highlight -- or obscure -- things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicised as government representatives -- mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states -- interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements ... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future\", the journal said.",

The session, taking place in Interlaken, Switzerland, is scheduled to run until 17 March.\n\nThe Synthesis Report is the final instalment of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report. It integrates and summarises the findings of the six reports released by IPCC during the current cycle which began in 2015. This includes three Special Reports and the three IPCC Working Group contributions to the Sixth Assessment Report.\n\nDuring this meeting, the IPCC will approve the Summary for Policymakers of the Synthesis Report line by line. The panel will also adopt the longer report section by section.\n\n\"Once approved, the Synthesis Report, will become a fundamental policy document for shaping climate action in the remainder of this pivotal decade. For policymakers of today and tomorrow, a much-needed textbook for addressing climate change. Make no mistake, inaction and delays are not listed as options,\" said the IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee opening the conference.\n\nOn behalf of the host country, Swiss Federal Councilor Albert R\u00f6sti welcomed over 650 delegates attending this IPCC plenary.\n\n\" The outcomes of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change help us, the policy makers, to take informed decisions on addressing climate change. Science and knowledge must play a central role in shaping our policy-making, guiding us as we work to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change,\" said Mr R\u00f6sti.\n\n\"The evidence put forward by the IPCC for climate change has been clear, convincing and irrefutable. The IPCC must now point the way to solutions so the urgent need to end global heating with cold, hard facts,\" said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\"\n\nVideo messages by Mr Guterres, WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Inger Andersen and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Simon Stiell were also screened at the plenary.\n\n\"I would like to thank all of you for the for the hard work for those reports, which are clearly having a clear message for the decision makers. We need to speed up our climate actions. At the moment, we are heading towards too high warming, and the various impacts of climate change are already very visible worldwide,\" said Prof. Taalas.",

                    "body": "The synthesis report will condense down nearly a decade of science.\n\nDIPLOMATS FROM 200 nations and leading climate scientists begin a week-long huddle in Switzerland Monday to distill nearly a decade of published science into a 20-odd-page warning about the existential danger of global warming and how to tackle it.\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) synthesis report, to be released on 20 March, will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unliveable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, told AFP.\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC, an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of volunteer scientists, has released six, three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good: global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise at \"well below\" 2C and within 1.5C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope: humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nUnveiled ahead of COP28 UN climate talks in Dubai in December, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\nEven in an 1.8C world -- an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists -- half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system, and economic productivity.\n\nRead Next Related Reads Student: Instead of enjoying our childhood, we're forced to protest over climate change\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet -- our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nFloods last year that covered a third of Pakistan, and ongoing drought in East Africa, both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect debate over the best way to decarbonise the global economy, with some emphasising the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line-by-line cannot change the science in the underlying reports' 10,750 pages, but they can decide what to leave in or out, and can highlight -- or obscure -- things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicised as government representatives -- mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states -- interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements ... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future,\" Nature said.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2023",

                    "body": "Diplomats from nearly 200 nations and top climate scientists begin a week-long huddle in Switzerland Monday to distil nearly a decade of published science into a 20-odd-page warning about the existential danger of global warming, and what to do about it.\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis report - to be released on March 20 - will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unlivable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, told AFP.\n\nREAD | ANALYSIS | The world is too busy to do its climate summit homework\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC - an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of volunteer scientists - has released six, three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good: global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\nCarbon budgets\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise at \"well below\" 2C, and at 1.5C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal - since adopted by governments and business as a hard target - was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope: humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports - one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use - will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nUnveiled ahead of COP28 UN climate talks in Dubai in December, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\n'More politicised'\n\nEven in an 1.8C world - an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists - half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system, and economic productivity.\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet - our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nREAD | Climate change could cost Germany almost R19trn by 2050\n\nFloods last year that covered a third of Pakistan, and ongoing drought in East Africa, both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect debate over the best way to decarbonise the global economy, with some emphasising the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line-by-line cannot change the science in the underlying reports' 10 750 pages, but they can decide what to leave in or out, and can highlight - or obscure - things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicised as government representatives - mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states - interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements ... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future,\" the journal said.",

                    "body": "Dhaka airport to introduce APIS preventing aerial movement of int'l offenders\n\nDiplomats from nearly 200 nations and top climate scientists begin a week-long huddle in Switzerland Monday to distill nearly a decade of published science into a 20-odd-page warning about the existential danger of global warming, and what to do about it.\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis report -- to be released on March 20 -- will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unlivable state.\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC -- an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of volunteer scientists -- has released six, three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good: global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\n- Carbon budgets -\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope: humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nUnveiled ahead of COP28 UN climate talks in Dubai in December, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\n- 'More politicised' -\n\nEven in an 1.8C world -- an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists -- half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system, and economic productivity.\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet -- our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nFloods last year that covered a third of Pakistan, and ongoing drought in East Africa, both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect debate over the best way to decarbonise the global economy, with some emphasising the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line-by-line cannot change the science in the underlying reports' 10,750 pages, but they can decide what to leave in or out, and can highlight -- or obscure -- things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicised as government representatives -- mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states -- interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements ... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future,\" the journal said.",

                    "body": "The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis report -- to be released on March 20 -- will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unlivable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, told AFP.\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC -- an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of volunteer scientists -- has released six, three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good: global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\nCarbon budgets\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise at \"well below\" 2C, and at 1.5C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope: humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nUnveiled ahead of COP28 UN climate talks in Dubai in December, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\n'More politicised'\n\nEven in an 1.8C world -- an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists -- half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system, and economic productivity.\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet -- our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nFloods last year that covered a third of Pakistan, and ongoing drought in East Africa, both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect debate over the best way to decarbonise the global economy, with some emphasising the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line-by-line cannot change the science in the underlying reports' 10,750 pages, but they can decide what to leave in or out, and can highlight -- or obscure -- things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicised as government representatives -- mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states -- interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements ... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future,\" the journal said.",

                    "body": "PARIS, March 13, 2023 (BSS/AFP) - Diplomats from nearly 200 nations and top climate scientists begin a week-long huddle in Switzerland Monday to distill nearly a decade of published science into a 20-odd-page warning about the existential danger of global warming, and what to do about it.\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis report -- to be released on March 20 -- will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unlivable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, told AFP.\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC -- an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of volunteer scientists -- has released six, three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good: global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\n- Carbon budgets -\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise at \"well below\" 2C, and at 1.5C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope: humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nUnveiled ahead of COP28 UN climate talks in Dubai in December, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\n- 'More politicised' -\n\nEven in an 1.8C world -- an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists -- half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system, and economic productivity.\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet -- our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nFloods last year that covered a third of Pakistan, and ongoing drought in East Africa, both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect debate over the best way to decarbonise the global economy, with some emphasising the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line-by-line cannot change the science in the underlying reports' 10,750 pages, but they can decide what to leave in or out, and can highlight -- or obscure -- things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicised as government representatives -- mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states -- interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements ... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future,\" the journal said.",

                    "body": "Diplomats from nearly 200 nations and top climate scientists begin a week-long huddle in Switzerland Monday to distill nearly a decade of published science into a 20-odd-page warning about the existential danger of global warming, and what to do about it.\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis report -- to be released on March 20 -- will detail observed and projected changes in Earth's climate system; past and future impacts such as devastating heatwaves, flooding and rising seas; and ways to halt the carbon pollution pushing Earth toward an unlivable state.\n\n\"It's a massive moment, seven years since the Paris Agreement and nine years since the last IPCC assessment report,\" Greenpeace Nordic senior policy advisor Kaisa Kosonen, an official observer at IPCC meetings, told AFP.\n\nSince its creation in 1988, the IPCC -- an intergovernmental body staffed by hundreds of volunteer scientists -- has released six, three-part assessments, the most recent in 2021-2022.\n\n\"It is scientists telling governments how they are doing during these crucial defining years,\" Kosonen said.\n\nThe report card is not good: global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow, even as science has cautioned that deadly consequences are coming sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously thought.\n\nSince the late 19th century, Earth's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.1 degrees Celsius, enough to amplify a crescendo of weather catastrophes on every continent.\n\n- Carbon budgets -\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris treaty, nations promised to collectively cap the rise at \"well below\" 2C, and at 1.5C if possible.\n\nAn IPCC special report in 2018 made it alarmingly clear that the more ambitious aspirational goal -- since adopted by governments and business as a hard target -- was a better bet for a climate-safe world.\n\nBut an already narrow pathway has become a tightrope: humanity's \"carbon budget\" for staying under the 1.5C barrier is less than 300 billion tonnes of CO2, barely seven times current yearly emissions, according to the IPCC.\n\nTwo other special reports -- one on oceans and Earth's frozen zones, the other on forests and land use -- will also be covered in the summary for policymakers under review in Interlaken.\n\n\"The synthesis report matters because it will be the last IPCC product for some years, and one of the major sources of knowledge to be considered in the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement,\" Oliver Geden, one of report's lead authors and a senior fellow at the German Institute for International Security Affairs, told AFP.\n\nUnveiled ahead of COP28 UN climate talks in Dubai in December, the global stocktake will confront nations with the deep inadequacy of their Paris pledges to cut emissions, which would allow global temperatures to rise 2.8C above the preindustrial benchmark.\n\nAmong the IPCC findings that could be highlighted in the synthesis report is the looming threat of deadly heat.\n\n- 'More politicised' -\n\nEven in an 1.8C world -- an optimistic scenario, according to some scientists -- half of humanity could, by 2100, be exposed to periods of life-threatening climate conditions arising from the coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nThere are similarly dire projections for health, the global food system, and economic productivity.\n\n\"What is at stake matters to everyone on the planet -- our ability to have healthy, nutritious and affordable food, both now and in the future,\" said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor at Cornell University and an IPCC lead author for the most recent report on climate impacts.\n\nFloods last year that covered a third of Pakistan, and ongoing drought in East Africa, both bear the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nThe synthesis report will also reflect debate over the best way to decarbonise the global economy, with some emphasising the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuel use and reduce consumer demand, and others the potential of technological solutions.\n\nDiplomats in Interlaken vetting the text line-by-line cannot change the science in the underlying reports' 10,750 pages, but they can decide what to leave in or out, and can highlight -- or obscure -- things through wording.\n\n\"Over time, IPCC meetings became more politicised as government representatives -- mainly, but not exclusively, from oil-producing states -- interfered in the scientists' discussions,\" the journal Nature said in a recent editorial.\n\nDespite that, \"the main IPCC studies have an extraordinary reach, informing everything from global climate agreements ... to the school climate strikes movement Fridays of Future,\" the journal said.",

                    "body": "ISLAMABAD: Noting that the melting of glaciers in the Himalayan region affects the water needs of the billions that live in South Asia, a noted climate scientist has urged Pakistan to decarbonise and avoid following the footsteps of the high-emitters in the developed world.\n\nProf Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Belgium's pick to lead the Geneva-based panel this year, was in Pakistan last week to gather support for the election, scheduled to be held during a special IPCC session to be held in Nairobi in July this year.\n\nThe IPCC is a scientific body created by two United Nations specialised agencies: UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) more than thirty years ago with a mandate to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts and solutions.\n\nAfter a meeting with Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman, he told Dawn the interaction proved very productive. \"She was very positive about my candidacy and said that the decision will be taken after consulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\" he said.\n\nBelgium's pick to lead UN's IPCC panel holds meetings in Islamabad\n\nProf van Ypersele, who has to his credit forty years of experience in climate science and diplomacy, told Dawn that Pakistan was contributing very little to global emissions, but its vulnerability is very high, as made evident by the last year's heat wave in spring and floods in the monsoon season.\n\nHe said that Pakistan and other developing countries should avoid following the developed countries. If these countries follow the same carbon-intensive path that developed countries have followed, in a few decades these countries will also be high emitters, he cautioned.\n\n\"We have to decarbonise as much as possible, and also need to take into account the need for energy access to everyone,\" he said.\n\nHe also noted that the vulnerability of the South Asian region was quite high. Being a tropical region where the level of temperature is relatively high, therefore the impacts are also larger.\n\nThe melting of glaciers in the Himalayas, he said, is a big problem for all the countries which depend on the existence of those glaciers for their water resources. If those glaciers melt quickly some of the rivers will have flooding, especially if it is combined with extreme rainfall, Prof van Ypersele said.\n\nSimilar themes were explored in this discussions in Islamabad. According to him, Ms Rehman spoke about the effects of climate change on Pakistan that resulted in the devastating floods of 2022. The minister spoke about the lack of funding and emphasised adequate resources from multilateral institutions needed particularly for adaptation measures.\n\nThe professor also held a group discussion with legislators, environmental experts and government and non-governmental officials at the residence of Belgian Ambassador Charles Delogne.\n\nSenator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change; former adviser to PM on climate change Malik Amin Aslam and former UNEP deputy executive director Shafqat Kakakhel also participated in the discussion.\n\nIPCC is expected to announce the official call for nominations for its chair next month. Belgium announced Prof van Ypersele's candidacy in October 2022. He also contested for the post in 2015, but missed out by just 12 votes.\n\nAs part of his campaign for the post, Prof van Ypersele has now completed a tour of the South Asian region, visiting Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, and holding video calls with officials from Bhutan and Sri Lanka, the two countries where Belgium has no diplomatic presence.\n\nThe IPCC is currently composed of 195 member states and as per rules, each country has one vote for the single-term post. This year, IPCC will also hold elections to its 34-member bureau for the new term.\n\nThe unique power of this UN climate body lies in the breadth and depth of its climate assessment reports. Thousands of experts from around the world synthesise the latest scientific findings on the impacts of and the potential responses to climate change with the IPCC's comprehensive Assessment Reports released every five to seven years.\n\nProf van Ypersele said that a meeting of IPCC will take place in Interlaken (Switzerland) this month to complete the final step of the sixth assessment report. The final stage in the sixth report will deliver to policy makers an integrated view of both problems and elements of solutions for them to implement.",
