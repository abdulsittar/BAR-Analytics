                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Gov. Chris Christie raised $1 of every $2 in the last three months of 2015 from just two states.\n\nChristie took in $1.2 million from donors in New Jersey and $320,825 from donors in New York, Federal Election Commission filings show. That was half of the $3 million he raised from October to December. He spent $3.2 million. Since the beginning of his campaign, Christie has raised $7.2 million and spent $6 million.\n\nHe entered this year with $1.1 million in the bank. Combined with his aligned super political action committee, America Leads, Christie and his supporters had $4.4 million to spend before the first contests of the 2016 campaign.\n\nChristie's biggest source of campaign cash between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 came from the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, according to a NJ Advance Media computer-assisted analysis of FEC data. Its employees gave $65,500.\n\nGibson Dunn conducted the taxpayer-financed probe that exonerated Christie in the George Washington Bridge lane closing scandal. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Wigenton in December criticized the firm for not keeping notes of its interviews with witnesses in its Bridgegate probe, saying taxpayers got \"opacity and gamesmanship.\"\n\nSecond were employees of Point 72 Asset Management, who contributed $60,400. The firm is headed by Steven Cohen, who with his wife on Dec. 2 donated $1 million apiece to America Leads, the super PAC.\n\nEmployees of Gibbons PC, a Newark-based law firm that represents clients before the state and federal governments, gave $7,400. They contributed $46,400 between July 1 and Sept. 30, more than any other source. Gibbons spent $1 million in 2014 lobbying in Trenton, more than all but six other groups, according to the state Election Law Enforcement Commission.\n\nChristie did find support elsewhere. Among those giving the maximum $2,700 to Christie's campaign in the last three months of 2015 was Las Vegas casino owner Steve Wynn and his wife Andrea. Wynn has expressed interest in owning a casino in North Jersey if gambling is expanded north from Atlantic City, according to Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson).\n\nChristie's fondness for the New York Mets and Dallas Cowboys didn't turn off other sports executives. Peter Magowan, former president of the San Francisco Giants, kicked in $2,700; Edward Cohen, a Washington Nationals owner, contributed $2,700, and Ken Kendrick, managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks, gave $1,000.\n\nLikewise, Arizona Cardinals owner William Bidwell and his wife Nancy gave $2,700 apiece, as did their son Michael, the team president.\n\nWhile New York Jets owner Woody Johnson serves as national finance chairman for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's presidential campaign, center Nick Mangoid gave $1,700 to Christie.\n\nChristie's biggest expenditure, $980,090, went for payroll. He also spent $295,539 on political consulting, $193,691 on Internet services and consulting, $164,189 to get on presidential primary ballots, and $143,837 on fundraising expenses.",

                    "title": "Chris Christie has $1 million in campaign account, strategist says",
                    "body": "Governor Christie's presidential campaign account had about $1 million left as the year began, just about enough to get him through the South Carolina primary on Feb. 20, a campaign strategist told The Washington Post on Sunday.\n\nStrategist Mike Duhaime said the account, which is subject to contribution limits under federal law, raised nearly $3 million in the final three months of 2015 on top of $4.2 million raised earlier in the year.\n\nDetails of those contributions and how the campaign spent its money were due to be filed with the Federal Election Commission by the end of Sunday.\n\nLike most of his opponents, Christie's report was not yet filed as of 8:30 p.m. But one of the campaign's front-runners, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, reported raising $20 million in the fourth quarter of last year and had $18.7 million in his account on Dec. 31.\n\nChristie's $3 million haul during the quarter was comparable to $2.8 million reported raised by business executive Carly Fiorina. And she ended the year with more cash than Christie, $4.5 million.\n\nDuhaime told The Post that Christie kept his staff smaller than some other campaigns, and workers in Iowa will head to South Carolina after tonight's caucuses. Christie has spent the most time in New Hampshire, which has its primary Feb. 9, and is hoping to do well there so that an \"infusion of support and donors\" will follow, Duhaime said.\n\nChristie's campaign account is limited to accepting no more than $2,700 for the primaries from individuals and $5,000 from political action committees.\n\nAmerica Leads, a super PAC supporting Christie that can accept unlimited amounts as long as its spending is not coordinated with the campaign, reported on Saturday that it took in $5.1 million from July through December of last year.\n\nThat report showed that America Leads had $3.3 million as the year ended, but money also apparently continued to come in because the committee disclosed spending at least $4.8 million in January. The FEC requires that independent expenditures that support or oppose a candidate be disclosed within 48 hours, while contribution disclosures follow a different schedule.\n\nIn the crowded Republican primary field, Christie has focused on competing against former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, all of whom are seeking the support of \"establishment\" Republicans.\n\nA super PAC supporting Rubio, Conservative Solutions PAC, reported Sunday it raised $14.3 million from July through December and had $13.9 million to spend at the end of 2015. The committee, which spent $3.2 million in January on ads and mailings attacking Christie in New Hampshire, raised $2.5 million in one check from Paul Singer, a billionaire New York hedge fund manager who was a Christie contributor in the past and was heavily courted by the governor for the presidential race.\n\nIn July, when America Leads filed its first disclosure report, Christie supporters touted the contributions of more than a dozen billionaires, hopeful they would give more as the year went on.\n\nWhile some did, reports filed Sunday also show that some of them moved on to other candidates.\n\nInvestor Seth Klarman, who gave $100,000 to America Leads in June, gave $250,000 in December to the pro-Rubio Conservative Solutions PAC, for example. Brewery executive August Busch also gave a combined $49,600 in July and December to Conservative Solutions after giving $100,000 to the pro-Christie America Leads in March.\n\nAnd a super PAC supporting Kasich, New Day for America, received $150,000 in August from portfolio manager Stanley Druckenmiller, who had given $100,000 to America Leads in April.\n\nEmail: jackson@northjersey.com; Blog: northjersey.com/thepoliticalstate",

                    "title": "Cash flow could be issue for 4 GOP contenders seeking boost",
                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Money may be growing tight for four Republican presidential hopefuls clustered under Donald Trump and Ted Cruz -- just when they're about to need it the most.\n\nFinancial reports coming out Sunday will show who began the year with enough cash to put their long-range campaign plans into motion. For Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich, the aim is a strong showing in New Hampshire on Feb. 9 that power-boosts them deep into primary season. Marco Rubio's imperative is to do well enough in the first four states to vote that he can make a sustained climb in the weeks that follow.\n\nThat sort of long slog would be costly because it involves travel around the two dozen states that hold contests on or before March 15. And some of those states, including Virginia, Florida and Ohio, have expensive advertising markets.\n\n\"If you're going to proceed after New Hampshire, you're absolutely going to need considerable funds,\" said Fred Malek, who has helped four decades of Republican presidential candidates raise money. \"The pace of the primaries builds up rapidly. It's far better to already have the cash on hand rather than have to ramp up.\"\n\nThe financial health of the campaigns of Christie, Kasich, Bush and Rubio is critically important because they're competing not only with each other, but with Trump, a billionaire who has vowed to spend whatever it takes to win, and Cruz, who began the year with $19 million in the bank -- an amount that probably exceeds most of his rivals. The foursome is considered to be competing for mainstream Republicans in a campaign that has seen Trump and Cruz most effectively tap populist anger and disdain for the establishment.\n\nIn addition to the candidates, the outside political groups known as super PACs helping them must turn in progress reports on their fundraising and spending Sunday.\n\nStanley Hubbard, a billionaire Minnesota broadcast executive, said he's poised to write a large check to a super PAC backing any one of his preferred candidates, Rubio, Christie and Bush, among others.\n\n\"If we get someone who really has a chance of doing something, I'm ready,\" he said. \"Someone just needs to rise to the top.\"\n\nAsked if he is confident anyone will have enough money to compete with Trump or Cruz, he said: \"No, I do not feel confident. But I'm hopeful.\"\n\nThere are signs that Rubio, a Florida senator, could be facing a cash crisis.\n\nAfter his campaign began leasing corporate jets and hiring dozens of additional employees at the end of the year, it recently downsized its advertising plans in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to advertising tracker Kantar Media's CMAG. His campaign said it would air a 30-minute Rubio town hall over the weekend on several Iowa TV stations. Federal broadcast filings show that sets him back at least $12,000.\n\nOn Friday, Rubio acknowledged the obvious, telling reporters he's not going to be the candidate with the most campaign cash. He also said he believes his campaign has spent money wisely, building up staffing slowly and trimming the ad buy to save money.\n\nFor Bush, the budget crunch arrived in October, when a fundraising shortfall -- combined with the realization that the primary could last well into 2016 -- prompted him to narrow what had been a large national campaign to focus squarely on New Hampshire.\n\n\"It's super hard to raise money,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, a New York-based top fundraiser for Bush. \"We've knuckled down to the new reality.\" But he said the Bush finance team is working furiously and \"generating cash every day for the campaign.\"\n\nJudging by their ad buys, Christie and Kasich haven't been reaping much contributor cash, either.\n\nEven as they barnstorm New Hampshire, they've each spent only about $500,000 on commercials there, CMAG shows. That's less than retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has paid little mind to New Hampshire.\n\nChristie campaign strategist Mike DuHaime said he expects \"a new influx\" of cash if Christie performs well in New Hampshire and at least some of his competitors drop out. But under several scenarios, all four candidates could think they've done well enough to continue on.\n\nCome Sunday, fundraising reports answer the question which of the four is best financially prepared to do so.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, the last time the campaigns had to report, Christie had collected $4.2 million for the year, Kasich $4.4 million, Rubio $15.5 million and Bush $24.8 million.\n\nPrevious filings also hinted at a fundraising challenge facing them: They're struggling to connect with low-dollar donors who can give again and again, replenishing campaign treasuries if the candidates survive deep into the primaries.\n\nFor Christie, Bush and Kasich, people giving $200 or less were barely a blip in their fundraising totals. About 20 percent of Rubio's operation is supported that way, compared with 42 percent of Cruz's.\n\nThat could be why all four lean heavily on super PACs to communicate with voters through paid media. While campaigns can raise no more than $2,700 from each donor for the primaries, super PACs can -- and do -- take million-dollar checks.\n\nThese outside groups have accounted for almost 90 percent of the $129 million in radio and television ads aired by the four establishment Republicans, according to CMAG.\n\nBut super PACs can only do so much, as Scott Walker and Rick Perry can attest. Both had well-funded outside efforts in their corner, but folded up their presidential bids when their campaigns couldn't raise enough money to keep going.",

                    "body": "Billionaire Steven Cohen, whose former hedge fund became embroiled in a federal insider trading investigation three years ago, donated another $2 million late last year to boost New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign, new filings show.\n\nThe $2 million contribution from Cohen and wife, Alexandra, to a pro-Christie super PAC accounted for nearly 40% of the $5.1 million America Leads raised during the last half of 2015. That's a sharp drop from the $11 million the group had collected during the previous six-month period.\n\nThe new contributions, made last December, brought to $4 million the couple has donated to America Leads.\n\nThe super PAC has rapidly depleted its cash as it spends heavily to boost Christie in New Hampshire, where the blunt-talking, two-term governor is working to make inroads with the state's moderate Republican voters ahead of the Fen. 9 primary. As of this week, America Leads had poured more than $15 million into television ads and other voter outreach, according to data compiled by the non-partisan Sunlight Foundation.\n\nChristie is polling well behind Republican rivals Donald Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, according to an average of recent Granite State polls by RealClearPolitics.\n\nCohen, one of Wall Street's wealthiest figures, was never charged in the long-running federal probe that led to his former firm, SAC Capitol Advisors, pleading guilty in 2013 to insider trading charges. This month, he reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that bars him from managing money for outside investors for two years.\n\nSeveral other prominent political and business figures wrote checks to the pro-Christie super PAC, year-end reports show, They include Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman, $100,000; former U.S. Senate candidate and professional wrestling magnate Linda McMahon, $250,000; and billionaire investment banker Herb Allen, $50,000.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nUSA TODAY's 2016 Presidential Poll Tracker\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1SQCi6l",

                    "body": "Billionaire Steven Cohen, whose former hedge fund became embroiled in a federal insider trading investigation three years ago, donated another $2 million late last year to boost New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign, new filings show.\n\nThe $2 million contribution from Cohen and wife, Alexandra, to a pro-Christie super PAC accounted for nearly 40% of the $5.1 million America Leads raised during the last half of 2015. That's a sharp drop from the $11 million the group had collected during the previous six-month period.\n\nThe new contributions, made last December, brought to $4 million the couple has donated to America Leads.\n\nThe super PAC has rapidly depleted its cash as it spends heavily to boost Christie in New Hampshire, where the blunt-talking, two-term governor is working to make inroads with the state's moderate Republican voters ahead of the Fen. 9 primary. As of this week, America Leads had poured more than $15 million into television ads and other voter outreach, according to data compiled by the non-partisan Sunlight Foundation.\n\nChristie is polling well behind Republican rivals Donald Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, according to an average of recent Granite State polls by RealClearPolitics.\n\nCohen, one of Wall Street's wealthiest figures, was never charged in the long-running federal probe that led to his former firm, SAC Capitol Advisors, pleading guilty in 2013 to insider trading charges. This month, he reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that bars him from managing money for outside investors for two years.\n\nSeveral other prominent political and business figures wrote checks to the pro-Christie super PAC, year-end reports show, They include Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman, $100,000; former U.S. Senate candidate and professional wrestling magnate Linda McMahon, $250,000; and billionaire investment banker Herb Allen, $50,000.\n\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/poll-tracker-2016/\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1SQCi6l",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money may be growing tight for four Republican presidential hopefuls clustered under Donald Trump and Ted Cruz -- just when they're about to need it the most.\n\nFinancial reports coming out Sunday will show who began the year with enough cash to put their long-range campaign plans into motion. For Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich, the aim is a strong showing in New Hampshire on Feb. 9 that power-boosts them deep into primary season. Marco Rubio's imperative is to do well enough in the first four states to vote that he can make a sustained climb in the weeks that follow.\n\nThat sort of long slog would be costly because it involves travel around the two dozen states that hold contests on or before March 15. And some of those states, including Virginia, Florida and Ohio, have expensive advertising markets.\n\n\"If you're going to proceed after New Hampshire, you're absolutely going to need considerable funds,\" said Fred Malek, who has helped four decades of Republican presidential candidates raise money. \"The pace of the primaries builds up rapidly. It's far better to already have the cash on hand rather than have to ramp up.\"\n\nThe financial health of the campaigns of Christie, Kasich, Bush and Rubio is critically important because they're competing not only with each other, but with Trump, a billionaire who has vowed to spend whatever it takes to win, and Cruz, who began the year with $19 million in the bank -- an amount that probably exceeds most of his rivals. The foursome is considered to be competing for mainstream Republicans in a campaign that has seen Trump and Cruz most effectively tap populist anger and disdain for the establishment.\n\nIn addition to the candidates, the outside political groups known as super PACs helping them must turn in progress reports on their fundraising and spending Sunday.\n\nStanley Hubbard, a billionaire Minnesota broadcast executive, said he's poised to write a large check to a super PAC backing any one of his preferred candidates, Rubio, Christie and Bush, among others.\n\n\"If we get someone who really has a chance of doing something, I'm ready,\" he said. \"Someone just needs to rise to the top.\"\n\nAsked if he is confident anyone will have enough money to compete with Trump or Cruz, he said: \"No, I do not feel confident. But I'm hopeful.\"\n\nThere are signs that Rubio, a Florida senator, could be facing a cash crisis.\n\nAfter his campaign began leasing corporate jets and hiring dozens of additional employees at the end of the year, it recently downsized its advertising plans in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to advertising tracker Kantar Media's CMAG. His campaign said it would air a 30-minute Rubio town hall over the weekend on several Iowa TV stations. Federal broadcast filings show that sets him back at least $12,000.\n\nOn Friday, Rubio acknowledged the obvious, telling reporters he's not going to be the candidate with the most campaign cash. He also said he believes his campaign has spent money wisely, building up staffing slowly and trimming the ad buy to save money.\n\nFor Bush, the budget crunch arrived in October, when a fundraising shortfall -- combined with the realization that the primary could last well into 2016 -- prompted him to narrow what had been a large national campaign to focus squarely on New Hampshire.\n\n\"It's super hard to raise money,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, a New York-based top fundraiser for Bush. \"We've knuckled down to the new reality.\" But he said the Bush finance team is working furiously and \"generating cash every day for the campaign.\"\n\nJudging by their ad buys, Christie and Kasich haven't been reaping much contributor cash, either.\n\nEven as they barnstorm New Hampshire, they've each spent only about $500,000 on commercials there, CMAG shows. That's less than retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has paid little mind to New Hampshire.\n\nChristie campaign strategist Mike DuHaime said he expects \"a new influx\" of cash if Christie performs well in New Hampshire and at least some of his competitors drop out. But under several scenarios, all four candidates could think they've done well enough to continue on.\n\nCome Sunday, fundraising reports answer the question which of the four is best financially prepared to do so.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The super political action committee backing Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign finished 2015 -- the key period before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary -- with $3.3 million in the bank, according to Federal Election Commission reports filed Saturday.\n\nAmerica Leads reported raising $5.1 million from July 1 to Dec. 31, less than half the $11 million raised during the first six months of last year. The PAC spent $12.6 million, all but $1.1 million on advertisements in support of Christie.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses are Monday and the New Hampshire primary eight days later.\n\nAmerica Leads' 2015 total of $16.1 million is less than the amount raised by super PACs supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz raised just in the first six months of the year. The PACs and candidate committees are required to report their year-end figures to the FEC by the end of Sunday.\n\nThe PAC relied primarily on the same contributors who gave in the first half of the year. Hedge fund manager Steven Cohen and his wife, Alexandra, each gave $1 million, matching their totals from the first half of 2015. Cohen is a minority owner of Christie's favorite baseball team, the New York Mets.\n\nWalter Buckley Jr., head of Buckley Muething Capital Management Co., donated $800,000 after giving $250,000 in the first half of the year. Linda McMahon, former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, gave a second $250,000 contribution. Hewlett-Packard chief executive Meg Whitman donated $100,000, same as her earlier contribution, as did Robert Hugin, chairman and CEO of Celgene Corp.\n\nChristie campaigned with both McMahon, when she ran for U.S. Senate from Connecticut, and Whitman, when she ran for governor of California.\n\nJohn Angelo, chief executive of Angelo Gordon Investments, donated a second $250,000. The company formerly employed First Lady Mary Pat Christie.",

Chris Christie's presidential campaign, according to federal campaign reports the organization filed Saturday.\n\nThe money was given to the America Leads super PAC in the second half of 2015, boosting the couple's contribution for the year to a total $4 million.\n\nAmerica Leads, which has directed much of its money into New Hampshire market campaign ads, raised $5.1 million between July and December and had $3.3 million unspent at the end of the year. For the year America Leads raised $16.1 million.\n\nThe critique that Iowa isn't a fair representation of the U.S. electorate isn't a new one -- but what does it mean to be representative?\n\nCohen led what was once a $14 billion hedge fund management company, SAC Capital Advisors LP, which for nearly a decade was the subject of a federal criminal probe into suspected insider trading. The company eventually pleaded guilty to fraud related to insider trading and agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle the charges and a subsidiary was fined $600 million in a a different insider trading case. Cohen himself was never criminally charged.\n\nASBURY PARK PRESS\n\n7 things to watch for at the Iowa caucuses\n\nThe new filing also shows a $50,000 contribution from Meg Whitman, the Hewlett Packard executive and former California gubernatorial candidates, bringing her total to the year to $200,000; while former WWE wrestling executive Linda McMahon matched her previous donation of $250,000, for a $500,000 total.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission deadline for super PAC reporting is Sunday -- one day before residents of Iowa become the first to cast votes in the 2016 presidential nominating process.\n\nAmerica Leads spokesman Tucker Martin said the organization raised money needed to implement strategy for a long race.\n\n\"We knew we needed to raise between $15 million and $20 million to effectively execute our strategy. We were successful in this effort and that has allowed us to implement our communications and voter contact plans exactly as we had intended,'' Martin said. \"We have focused on putting the governor, in his own words, in front of as many voters as possible. The more voters have seen and heard the governor, the more support he has gained. Now, we look forward to supporting the governor's candidacy in the next stage of this campaign. We have already pre-booked TV time in South Carolina as we prepare to capitalize on the strong momentum we know he will have following the results from Iowa and New Hampshire''.\n\nIowans on Monday will gather in 1,681 caucus precincts -- with meetings in libraries, churches, local community centers, and gymnasiums -- starting at 7 p.m. (Central Time) Monday, with no set closing time. The event kicks off state-by-state delegate selection, prelude to the national conventions (Democrats will meet in Philadelphia and Republicans will meet in Cleveland, both in July), where party nominees are officially chosen.\n\nASBURY PARK PRESS\n\n@ISSUE: Who did APP readers pick for president?\n\nBob Jordan 609-984-4343, bjordan@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing\n\nDownload our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.

                    "title": "Cash Flow Could Be Issue for 4 GOP Contenders Seeking Boost",
                    "body": "Money may be growing tight for four Republican presidential hopefuls clustered under Donald Trump and Ted Cruz -- just when they're about to need it the most.\n\nFinancial reports coming out Sunday will show who began the year with enough cash to put their long-range campaign plans into motion. For Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich, the aim is a strong showing in New Hampshire on Feb. 9 that power-boosts them deep into primary season. Marco Rubio's imperative is to do well enough in the first four states to vote that he can make a sustained climb in the weeks that follow.\n\nThat sort of long slog would be costly because it involves travel around the two dozen states that hold contests on or before March 15. And some of those states, including Virginia, Florida and Ohio, have expensive advertising markets.\n\n\"If you're going to proceed after New Hampshire, you're absolutely going to need considerable funds,\" said Fred Malek, who has helped four decades of Republican presidential candidates raise money. \"The pace of the primaries builds up rapidly. It's far better to already have the cash on hand rather than have to ramp up.\"\n\nThe financial health of the campaigns of Christie, Kasich, Bush and Rubio is critically important because they're competing not only with each other, but with Trump, a billionaire who has vowed to spend whatever it takes to win, and Cruz, who began the year with $19 million in the bank -- an amount that probably exceeds most of his rivals. The foursome is considered to be competing for mainstream Republicans in a campaign that has seen Trump and Cruz most effectively tap populist anger and disdain for the establishment.\n\nIn addition to the candidates, the outside political groups known as super PACs helping them must turn in progress reports on their fundraising and spending Sunday.\n\nStanley Hubbard, a billionaire Minnesota broadcast executive, said he's poised to write a large check to a super PAC backing any one of his preferred candidates, Rubio, Christie and Bush, among others.\n\n\"If we get someone who really has a chance of doing something, I'm ready,\" he said. \"Someone just needs to rise to the top.\"\n\nAsked if he is confident anyone will have enough money to compete with Trump or Cruz, he said: \"No, I do not feel confident. But I'm hopeful.\"\n\nThere are signs that Rubio, a Florida senator, could be facing a cash crisis.\n\nAfter his campaign began leasing corporate jets and hiring dozens of additional employees at the end of the year, it recently downsized its advertising plans in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to advertising tracker Kantar Media's CMAG. His campaign said it would air a 30-minute Rubio town hall over the weekend on several Iowa TV stations. Federal broadcast filings show that sets him back at least $12,000.\n\nOn Friday, Rubio acknowledged the obvious, telling reporters he's not going to be the candidate with the most campaign cash. He also said he believes his campaign has spent money wisely, building up staffing slowly and trimming the ad buy to save money.\n\nFor Bush, the budget crunch arrived in October, when a fundraising shortfall -- combined with the realization that the primary could last well into 2016 -- prompted him to narrow what had been a large national campaign to focus squarely on New Hampshire.\n\n\"It's super hard to raise money,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, a New York-based top fundraiser for Bush. \"We've knuckled down to the new reality.\" But he said the Bush finance team is working furiously and \"generating cash every day for the campaign.\"\n\nJudging by their ad buys, Christie and Kasich haven't been reaping much contributor cash, either.\n\nEven as they barnstorm New Hampshire, they've each spent only about $500,000 on commercials there, CMAG shows. That's less than retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has paid little mind to New Hampshire.\n\nChristie campaign strategist Mike DuHaime said he expects \"a new influx\" of cash if Christie performs well in New Hampshire and at least some of his competitors drop out. But under several scenarios, all four candidates could think they've done well enough to continue on.\n\nCome Sunday, fundraising reports answer the question which of the four is best financially prepared to do so.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, the last time the campaigns had to report, Christie had collected $4.2 million for the year, Kasich $4.4 million, Rubio $15.5 million and Bush $24.8 million.\n\nPrevious filings also hinted at a fundraising challenge facing them: They're struggling to connect with low-dollar donors who can give again and again, replenishing campaign treasuries if the candidates survive deep into the primaries.\n\nFor Christie, Bush and Kasich, people giving $200 or less were barely a blip in their fundraising totals. About 20 percent of Rubio's operation is supported that way, compared with 42 percent of Cruz's.\n\nThat could be why all four lean heavily on super PACs to communicate with voters through paid media. While campaigns can raise no more than $2,700 from each donor for the primaries, super PACs can -- and do -- take million-dollar checks.\n\nThese outside groups have accounted for almost 90 percent of the $129 million in radio and television ads aired by the four establishment Republicans, according to CMAG.\n\nBut super PACs can only do so much, as Scott Walker and Rick Perry can attest. Both had well-funded outside efforts in their corner, but folded up their presidential bids when their campaigns couldn't raise enough money to keep going.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press writers Chad Day in Washington, Jill Colvin in Iowa City, Iowa, and Steve Peoples in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.\n\n-- --\n\nFollow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Money may be growing tight for four Republican presidential hopefuls clustered under Donald Trump and Ted Cruz - just when they're about to need it the most.\n\nFinancial reports coming out Sunday will reveal those who began the year with enough cash to put their long-range campaign plans into motion. For Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich, the aim is a strong showing in New Hampshire on Feb. 9 that power-boosts them deep into primary season. Marco Rubio's imperative is to do well enough in the first four states to vote that he can make a sustained climb in the weeks that follow.\n\nThat sort of long slog would be costly because it involves travel around the two dozen states that hold contests on or before March 15. And some of those states, including Virginia, Florida and Ohio, have expensive advertising markets.\n\n\"If you're going to proceed after New Hampshire, you're absolutely going to need considerable funds,\" said Fred Malek, who has helped four decades of Republican presidential candidates raise money. \"The pace of the primaries builds up rapidly. It's far better to already have the cash on hand rather than have to ramp up.\"\n\nThe financial health of the campaigns of Christie, Kasich, Bush and Rubio is critically important because they're competing not only with each other, but with Trump, a billionaire who has vowed to spend whatever it takes to win, and Cruz, who began the year with $19 million in the bank - an amount that probably exceeds most of his rivals.\n\nThe foursome is considered to be competing for mainstream Republicans in a campaign that has seen Trump and Cruz most effectively tap populist anger and disdain for the establishment.\n\nIn addition to the candidates, the super PACs helping them must turn in progress reports on their fundraising and spending Sunday.\n\nStanley Hubbard, a billionaire Minnesota broadcast executive, said he's poised to write a large check to a super PAC backing any one of his preferred candidates, Rubio, Christie and Bush, among others.\n\n\"If we get someone who really has a chance of doing something, I'm ready,\" he said. \"Someone just needs to rise to the top.\"\n\nAsked if he is confident anyone will have enough money to compete with Trump or Cruz, he said: \"No, I do not feel confident. But I'm hopeful.\"\n\nThere are signs that Rubio, a Florida senator, could be facing a cash crisis.\n\nAfter his campaign began leasing corporate jets and hiring dozens of additional employees at the end of the year, it recently downsized its advertising plans in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to advertising tracker Kantar Media's CMAG.\n\nRubio's aides say they've reduced their ad plan because other candidates aren't spending as much as they'd anticipated. And on Friday, Rubio acknowledged the obvious, telling reporters he's not going to be the candidate with the most campaign cash.\n\nFor Bush, the budget crunch arrived in October, when a fundraising shortfall - combined with the realization that the primary could last well into 2016 - prompted him to narrow what had been a large national campaign to focus squarely on New Hampshire.\n\n\"It's super hard to raise money,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, a New York-based top fundraiser for Bush. \"We've knuckled down to the new reality.\" But he said the Bush finance team is working furiously and \"generating cash every day for the campaign.\"\n\nJudging by their ad buys, Christie and Kasich haven't been reaping much contributor cash, either.\n\nEven as they barnstorm New Hampshire, they've each spent only about $500,000 on commercials there, CMAG shows. That's less, even, than retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has paid little mind to New Hampshire.\n\nCome Sunday, fundraising reports answer the question which of the four is best prepared financially to move on from New Hampshire.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, the last time the campaigns had to report, Christie had collected $4.2 million for the year, Kasich $4.4 million, Rubio $15.5 million and Bush $24.8 million.\n\nPrevious filings also hinted at a fundraising challenge facing them: They're struggling to connect with low-dollar donors who can give again and again, replenishing campaign treasuries if the candidates survive deep into the primaries.\n\nFor Christie, Bush and Kasich, people giving $200 or less were barely a blip in their fundraising totals. About 20 percent of Rubio's operation is supported that way, compared with 42 percent of Cruz's.\n\nThat could be why all four lean heavily on super PACs to communicate with voters through paid media. While campaigns can raise no more than $2,700 from each donor for the primaries, super PACs can - and do - take million-dollar checks.\n\nThese outside groups have accounted for almost 90 percent of the $129 million in radio and television ads aired by the four establishment Republicans, according to CMAG.\n\nBut super PACs can only do so much, as Scott Walker and Rick Perry can attest. Both had well-funded outside efforts in their corner, but folded up their presidential bids when their campaigns couldn't raise enough money to keep going.",

Cohen, the hedge fund billionaire who escaped the insider trading probe that engulfed his firm, and his wife, Alexandra Marie.\n\nTheir contribution in the second half of 2015 follows the $1 million they each gave in the first six months, according to the PAC's disclosure filed with the Federal Election Commission Saturday. The super PAC, America Leads, raised a total of $5.1 million between July and December, and had $3.3 million on hand as of the end of the year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMeg Whitman, the Hewlett Packard executive, chipped in another $50,000, bringing her total to $200,000, and wrestling tycoon Linda McMahon repeated her previous donation of $250,000. So did investor John Angelo (who died this month). Seth Klarman, who leads influential Boston hedge fund Baupost, gave a second $100,000.\n\nThe PAC also raised $200,000 from Ferreira Construction Co., a builder with state contracts and business ties to Christie's brother, Todd.\n\nAmerica Leads has been spending heavily on TV ads in New Hampshire, as well as some online, radio and mailers, according to the filing.\n\nA day after Cohen's hedge fund, then known as SAC Capital, pleaded guilty to criminal insider trading charges, Cohen went to Christie's 2013 reelection celebration.",

                    "body": "DES MOINES, Iowa (CNN) -\n\nCampaigns and their allied super PACs on Sunday will unveil for the first time in months how much cash they've raised, signaling how much staying power they have in the race for the White House.\n\nThe big reveal at this point in the race: cash on hand, which tells observers how much money the political action committees have to spend in states beyond Iowa and New Hampshire -- and whether they can run a national campaign. Just as a poor showing in the early-voting states may help winnow the presidential field, a poor fundraising performance will get the vultures circling.\n\nThis is also the first chance in six months to find out who has been paying for the tens of millions of dollars of super PAC ads that have blanketed the country. The groups can accept and spend unlimited amounts of cash, but federal election rules means we haven't seen the donor rolls since midsummer.\n\nHere are eight questions that could be answered this weekend:\n\nHow much is Donald Trump spending on his own behalf?\n\nThere have been few claims more fact-checked -- and unambiguously deemed incorrect -- than Trump's frequent claim that he is \"self-funding\" his campaign. It means that he is free from the corrupting influence of lobbyists and billionaires who treat their candidate as \"puppets\" -- but the claim as of October was not true: Trump has received millions of dollars in donations that are funding things like Trump hats and Trump T-shirts.\n\nBut Trump's spending has increased substantially since then -- he has launched a modest television campaign in early-voting states, and his campaign travel intensified in 2015's closing months. So how much has Trump, who claims to have a net worth of $10 billion, actually invested into his political campaign? We'll see Sunday.\n\nIs Hillary Clinton in trouble?\n\nHillary Clinton's campaign says it had $38 million on hand as of the end of 2015, and touted that it raised $37 million in primary dollars as it fights a surprising challenge from Bernie Sanders.\n\nBut Clinton's biggest advantage over the Vermont senator was supposed to be in super PACs, and Priorities USA on Friday night said it's raised $50 million through this month. The group also claims an additional $42 million in pledges. How much the super PACs are able to back Clinton this year will determine whether or not she can win the White House.\n\nHow many people are Feeling the Bern?\n\nSanders' campaign has said it had about $28 million on hand at the end of 2015 and raised $33 million in the final months.\n\nBut the big number his campaign will tout is the total number of small donors who have bought into his insurgent campaign. Sanders has likely raised much more of his money from low-dollar donors who gave less than $200, unlike Clinton, who has relied typically on high-dollar and time-consuming fund-raising events for much of her hauls. Watch for Sanders to tout his broad reach and continue his rhetoric against the big donors favoring Clinton.\n\nHave the conservative megadonors placed their bets?\n\nRepublican donors, confronted by a field of unprecedented size and depth, largely avoided committing to a single candidate in the first half of the year, a CNN analysis of super PAC donations found last July. The nation's top GOP moneymen gave to multiple candidates, or none at all, largely avoiding placing seven-digit donations on a single candidate as they waited for a dose of political clarity.\n\nThe field has indeed winnowed since July, with five candidates dropping out. But there are still at least four candidates with significant appeal to establishment donors. Have any of those successfully wooed top donors more than any other? Of particular interest: Sheldon Adelson, who is believed to be most supportive of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Will their super PACs post million-dollar checks from the nation's top Republican donor? And have the Ricketts family, which previously backed Scott Walker, decided on a single candidate to support?\n\nHave donors abandoned Jeb Bush?\n\nThe super PAC supporting Jeb Bush, Right to Rise, shattered fund-raising records by collecting $100 million in the first six months of 2015. That was in the golden age of Jeb.\n\nNow, having lost significant support in the Republican horse race, the question is how much firepower Bush has remaining. The Washington Post reported that he had only raised an an additional $13 million as of December. Has he been able to attract any new top donors, or is it the same crew -- most of whom did not invest more than $1 million in his super PAC -- doubling down?\n\nIf Bush is able to still haul in a not-insignificant fraction of his previous sum, it will be easier to imagine him staying in the race through March, even if it does not cement a path to victory.\n\nWhat are Ted Cruz's super PACs up to?\n\nForgotten in Cruz's rise to the top of Iowa polls is that it came largely without any advertising by his campaign and super PAC, who have hugged their money closely and been only wiling to spend big on television at the open of 2016. That has even invited some criticism, from both within and outside the campaign, of why his super PACs have been so stingy.\n\nSo Keep the Promise, the constellation of Cruz super PACs, are likely to still have much of the $38 million they reported at the end of July. Yet how broad is their financial base? Almost all of that money came from three anchor families who gave at least $10 million, and it's unknown how many new big donors they've brought into the fold. And we'll also learn more about Stand for Truth, a rival pro-Cruz super PAC started by a top Cruz bundler but whose funders and strategy is largely mysterious.\n\nHow dependent are John Kasich and Chris Christie on New Hampshire?\n\nOne of the surprising takeaways from the last fundraising report in October was how cash poor the Kasich and Christie campaigns are. Both governors are staking their candidacies on New Hampshire, and their super PACs and campaigns over the past four weeks have unloaded a torrent of attacks meant to push them on top of the establishment heap in the state and propel them toward the nomination.",

Just as a poor showing in the early-voting states may help winnow the presidential field, a poor fundraising performance will get the vultures circling.\n\nThis is also the first chance in six months to find out who has been paying for the tens of millions of dollars of super PAC ads that have blanketed the country. The groups can accept and spend unlimited amounts of cash, but federal election rules means we haven't seen the donor rolls since midsummer.\n\nHere are eight questions that could be answered this weekend:\n\nHow much is Donald Trump spending on his own behalf?\n\nThere have been few claims more fact-checked -- and unambiguously deemed incorrect -- than Trump's frequent claim that he is \"self-funding\" his campaign. It means that he is free from the corrupting influence of lobbyists and billionaires who treat their candidate as \"puppets\" -- but the claim as of October was not true: Trump has received millions of dollars in donations that are funding things like Trump hats and Trump T-shirts.\n\nBut Trump's spending has increased substantially since then -- he has launched a modest television campaign in early-voting states, and his campaign travel intensified in 2015's closing months. So how much has Trump, who claims to have a net worth of $10 billion, actually invested into his political campaign? We'll see Sunday.\n\nIs Hillary Clinton in trouble?\n\nHillary Clinton's campaign says it had $38 million on hand as of the end of 2015, and touted that it raised $37 million in primary dollars as it fights a surprising challenge from Bernie Sanders.\n\nBut Clinton's biggest advantage over the Vermont senator was supposed to be in super PACs, and Priorities USA on Friday night said it's raised $50 million through this month. The group also claims an additional $42 million in pledges. How much the super PACs are able to back Clinton this year will determine whether or not she can win the White House.\n\nHow many people are Feeling the Bern?\n\nSanders' campaign has said it had about $28 million on hand at the end of 2015 and raised $33 million in the final months.\n\nBut the big number his campaign will tout is the total number of small donors who have bought into his insurgent campaign. Sanders has likely raised much more of his money from low-dollar donors who gave less than $200, unlike Clinton, who has relied typically on high-dollar and time-consuming fund-raising events for much of her hauls. Watch for Sanders to tout his broad reach and continue his rhetoric against the big donors favoring Clinton.\n\nHave the conservative megadonors placed their bets?\n\nRepublican donors, confronted by a field of unprecedented size and depth, largely avoided committing to a single candidate in the first half of the year, a CNN analysis of super PAC donations found last July. The nation's top GOP moneymen gave to multiple candidates, or none at all, largely avoiding placing seven-digit donations on a single candidate as they waited for a dose of political clarity.\n\nThe field has indeed winnowed since July, with five candidates dropping out. But there are still at least four candidates with significant appeal to establishment donors. Have any of those successfully wooed top donors more than any other? Of particular interest: Sheldon Adelson, who is believed to be most supportive of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Will their super PACs post million-dollar checks from the nation's top Republican donor? And have the Ricketts family, which previously backed Scott Walker, decided on a single candidate to support?\n\nHave donors abandoned Jeb Bush?\n\nThe super PAC supporting Jeb Bush, Right to Rise, shattered fund-raising records by collecting $100 million in the first six months of 2015. That was in the golden age of Jeb.\n\nNow, having lost significant support in the Republican horse race, the question is how much firepower Bush has remaining. The Washington Post reported that he had only raised an an additional $13 million as of December. Has he been able to attract any new top donors, or is it the same crew -- most of whom did not invest more than $1 million in his super PAC -- doubling down?\n\nIf Bush is able to still haul in a not-insignificant fraction of his previous sum, it will be easier to imagine him staying in the race through March, even if it does not cement a path to victory.\n\nWhat are Ted Cruz's super PACs up to?\n\nForgotten in Cruz's rise to the top of Iowa polls is that it came largely without any advertising by his campaign and super PAC, who have hugged their money closely and been only wiling to spend big on television at the open of 2016. That has even invited some criticism, from both within and outside the campaign, of why his super PACs have been so stingy.\n\nSo Keep the Promise, the constellation of Cruz super PACs, are likely to still have much of the $38 million they reported at the end of July. Yet how broad is their financial base? Almost all of that money came from three anchor families who gave at least $10 million, and it's unknown how many new big donors they've brought into the fold. And we'll also learn more about Stand for Truth, a rival pro-Cruz super PAC started by a top Cruz bundler but whose funders and strategy is largely mysterious.\n\nHow dependent are John Kasich and Chris Christie on New Hampshire?\n\nOne of the surprising takeaways from the last fundraising report in October was how cash poor the Kasich and Christie campaigns are. Both governors are staking their candidacies on New Hampshire, and their super PACs and campaigns over the past four weeks have unloaded a torrent of attacks meant to push them on top of the establishment heap in the state and propel them toward the nomination.\n\nBut neither Kasich nor Christie have deep organizations beyond the Granite State, and their financial positions on Sunday will show just how much they need to catch lightning in a bottle there on Feb. 9, or whether their time is up.\n\nDoes Ben Carson have anything left?\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon has shown the ability to raise a lot of cash, and his campaign collected $23 million in the fourth quarter, they said weeks ago. But how much of that is still in the bank?\n\nCarson raises most of his cash through the expensive process of low-dollar prospecting -- reaching out to large numbers of Americans through direct mail and email to learn if they would like to give. Carson likely is still in a solid financial position, but given the implosion of his campaign over the past few months, it will be revealing to see if his fund-raising machine slowed and whether his cash on hand figure reflects those troubles.\n\nRecommended",

                    "body": "Story highlightsThe deadline for campaigns to report their 2015 fund-raising totals to the Federal Election Commission is SundayThis will be the first time in six months to find out what super PACs have raised and spent\n\nDes Moines, Iowa (CNN)Campaigns and their allied super PACs on Sunday will unveil for the first time in months how much cash they've raised, signaling how much staying power they have in the race for the White House.\n\nThe big reveal at this point in the race: cash on hand, which tells observers how much money the political action committees have to spend in states beyond Iowa and New Hampshire -- and whether they can run a national campaign. Just as a poor showing in the early-voting states may help winnow the presidential field, a poor fundraising performance will get the vultures circling.\n\nThis is also the first chance in six months to find out who has been paying for the tens of millions of dollars of super PAC ads that have blanketed the country. The groups can accept and spend unlimited amounts of cash, but federal election rules means we haven't seen the donor rolls since midsummer.\n\nHere are eight questions that could be answered this weekend:\n\nHow much is Donald Trump spending on his own behalf?Read More\n\nThere have been few claims more fact-checked -- and unambiguously deemed incorrect -- than Trump's frequent claim that he is \"self-funding\" his campaign. It means that he is free from the corrupting influence of lobbyists and billionaires who treat their candidate as \"puppets\" -- but the claim as of October was not true: Trump has received millions of dollars in donations that are funding things like Trump hats and Trump T-shirts.\n\nBut Trump's spending has increased substantially since then -- he has launched a modest television campaign in early-voting states, and his campaign travel intensified in 2015's closing months. So how much has Trump, who claims to have a net worth of $10 billion, actually invested into his political campaign? We'll see Sunday.\n\nIs Hillary Clinton in trouble?\n\nHillary Clinton's campaign says it had $38 million on hand as of the end of 2015, and touted that it raised $37 million in primary dollars as it fights a surprising challenge from Bernie Sanders.\n\nBut Clinton's biggest advantage over the Vermont senator was supposed to be in super PACs, and Priorities USA on Friday night said it's raised $50 million through this month. The group also claims an additional $42 million in pledges. How much the super PACs are able to back Clinton this year will determine whether or not she can win the White House.\n\nHow many people are Feeling the Bern?\n\nSanders' campaign has said it had about $28 million on hand at the end of 2015 and raised $33 million in the final months.\n\nBut the big number his campaign will tout is the total number of small donors who have bought into his insurgent campaign. Sanders has likely raised much more of his money from low-dollar donors who gave less than $200, unlike Clinton, who has relied typically on high-dollar and time-consuming fund-raising events for much of her hauls. Watch for Sanders to tout his broad reach and continue his rhetoric against the big donors favoring Clinton.\n\nHave the conservative megadonors placed their bets?\n\nRepublican donors, confronted by a field of unprecedented size and depth, largely avoided committing to a single candidate in the first half of the year, a CNN analysis of super PAC donations found last July. The nation's top GOP moneymen gave to multiple candidates, or none at all, largely avoiding placing seven-digit donations on a single candidate as they waited for a dose of political clarity.\n\nThe field has indeed winnowed since July, with five candidates dropping out. But there are still at least four candidates with significant appeal to establishment donors. Have any of those successfully wooed top donors more than any other? Of particular interest: Sheldon Adelson, who is believed to be most supportive of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Will their super PACs post million-dollar checks from the nation's top Republican donor? And have the Ricketts family, which previously backed Scott Walker, decided on a single candidate to support?\n\nSuper PAC takes aim at Trump's credentials\n\nHave donors abandoned Jeb Bush?\n\nThe super PAC supporting Jeb Bush, Right to Rise, shattered fund-raising records by collecting $100 million in the first six months of 2015. That was in the golden age of Jeb.\n\nNow, having lost significant support in the Republican horse race, the question is how much firepower Bush has remaining. The Washington Post reported that he had only raised an an additional $13 million as of December. Has he been able to attract any new top donors, or is it the same crew -- most of whom did not invest more than $1 million in his super PAC -- doubling down?\n\nIf Bush is able to still haul in a not-insignificant fraction of his previous sum, it will be easier to imagine him staying in the race through March, even if it does not cement a path to victory.\n\nWhat are Ted Cruz's super PACs up to?\n\nForgotten in Cruz's rise to the top of Iowa polls is that it came largely without any advertising by his campaign and super PAC, who have hugged their money closely and been only wiling to spend big on television at the open of 2016. That has even invited some criticism, from both within and outside the campaign, of why his super PACs have been so stingy.\n\nSo Keep the Promise, the constellation of Cruz super PACs, are likely to still have much of the $38 million they reported at the end of July. Yet how broad is their financial base? Almost all of that money came from three anchor families who gave at least $10 million, and it's unknown how many new big donors they've brought into the fold. And we'll also learn more about Stand for Truth, a rival pro-Cruz super PAC started by a top Cruz bundler but whose funders and strategy is largely mysterious.\n\nHow dependent are John Kasich and Chris Christie on New Hampshire?\n\nOne of the surprising takeaways from the last fundraising report in October was how cash poor the Kasich and Christie campaigns are. Both governors are staking their candidacies on New Hampshire, and their super PACs and campaigns over the past four weeks have unloaded a torrent of attacks meant to push them on top of the establishment heap in the state and propel them toward the nomination.\n\nBut neither Kasich nor Christie have deep organizations beyond the Granite State, and their financial positions on Sunday will show just how much they need to catch lightning in a bottle there on Feb. 9, or whether their time is up.\n\nDoes Ben Carson have anything left?\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon has shown the ability to raise a lot of cash, and his campaign collected $23 million in the fourth quarter, they said weeks ago. But how much of that is still in the bank?\n\nCarson raises most of his cash through the expensive process of low-dollar prospecting -- reaching out to large numbers of Americans through direct mail and email to learn if they would like to give. Carson likely is still in a solid financial position, but given the implosion of his campaign over the past few months, it will be revealing to see if his fund-raising machine slowed and whether his cash on hand figure reflects those troubles.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money may be growing tight for four Republican presidential hopefuls clustered under Donald Trump and Ted Cruz -- just when they're about to need it the most.\n\nFinancial reports coming out Sunday will reveal those who began the year with enough cash to put their long-range campaign plans into motion. For Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich, the aim is a strong showing in New Hampshire on Feb. 9 that power-boosts them deep into primary season. Marco Rubio's imperative is to do well enough in the first four states to vote that he can make a sustained climb in the weeks that follow.\n\nThat sort of long slog would be costly because it involves travel around the two dozen states that hold contests on or before March 15. And some of those states, including Virginia, Florida and Ohio, have expensive advertising markets.\n\n\"If you're going to proceed after New Hampshire, you're absolutely going to need considerable funds,\" said Fred Malek, who has helped four decades of Republican presidential candidates raise money. \"The pace of the primaries builds up rapidly. It's far better to already have the cash on hand rather than have to ramp up.\"\n\nThe financial health of the campaigns of Christie, Kasich, Bush and Rubio is critically important because they're competing not only with each other, but with Trump, a billionaire who has vowed to spend whatever it takes to win, and Cruz, who began the year with $19 million in the bank -- an amount that probably exceeds most of his rivals. The foursome is considered to be competing for mainstream Republicans in a campaign that has seen Trump and Cruz most effectively tap populist anger and disdain for the establishment.\n\nIn addition to the candidates, the super PACs helping them must turn in progress reports on their fundraising and spending Sunday.\n\nStanley Hubbard, a billionaire Minnesota broadcast executive, said he's poised to write a large check to a super PAC backing any one of his preferred candidates, Rubio, Christie and Bush, among others.\n\n\"If we get someone who really has a chance of doing something, I'm ready,\" he said. \"Someone just needs to rise to the top.\"\n\nAsked if he is confident anyone will have enough money to compete with Trump or Cruz, he said: \"No, I do not feel confident. But I'm hopeful.\"\n\nThere are signs that Rubio, a Florida senator, could be facing a cash crisis.\n\nAfter his campaign began leasing corporate jets and hiring dozens of additional employees at the end of the year, it recently downsized its advertising plans in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to advertising tracker Kantar Media's CMAG.\n\nRubio's aides say they've reduced their ad plan because other candidates aren't spending as much as they'd anticipated. And on Friday, Rubio acknowledged the obvious, telling reporters he's not going to be the candidate with the most campaign cash.\n\nFor Bush, the budget crunch arrived in October, when a fundraising shortfall -- combined with the realization that the primary could last well into 2016 -- prompted him to narrow what had been a large national campaign to focus squarely on New Hampshire.\n\n\"It's super hard to raise money,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, a New York-based top fundraiser for Bush. \"We've knuckled down to the new reality.\" But he said the Bush finance team is working furiously and \"generating cash every day for the campaign.\"\n\nJudging by their ad buys, Christie and Kasich haven't been reaping much contributor cash, either.\n\nEven as they barnstorm New Hampshire, they've each spent only about $500,000 on commercials there, CMAG shows. That's less, even, than retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has paid little mind to New Hampshire.\n\nCome Sunday, fundraising reports answer the question which of the four is best prepared financially to move on from New Hampshire.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, the last time the campaigns had to report, Christie had collected $4.2 million for the year, Kasich $4.4 million, Rubio $15.5 million and Bush $24.8 million.\n\nPrevious filings also hinted at a fundraising challenge facing them: They're struggling to connect with low-dollar donors who can give again and again, replenishing campaign treasuries if the candidates survive deep into the primaries.\n\nFor Christie, Bush and Kasich, people giving $200 or less were barely a blip in their fundraising totals. About 20 percent of Rubio's operation is supported that way, compared with 42 percent of Cruz's.\n\nThat could be why all four lean heavily on super PACs to communicate with voters through paid media. While campaigns can raise no more than $2,700 from each donor for the primaries, super PACs can -- and do -- take million-dollar checks.\n\nThese outside groups have accounted for almost 90 percent of the $129 million in radio and television ads aired by the four establishment Republicans, according to CMAG.\n\nBut super PACs can only do so much, as Scott Walker and Rick Perry can attest. Both had well-funded outside efforts in their corner, but folded up their presidential bids when their campaigns couldn't raise enough money to keep going.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Chad Day in Washington and Steve Peoples in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.\n\n__\n\nFollow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

The campaigns are continuing to spend heavily to get a broad swath of voters next week, said these people.\n\nIn some cases, super PACs have been even more active with social-media ad campaigns than the candidates themselves. Super PAC spending was slow to start on social media, but as the caucus and primary dates have neared, Twitter TWTR 1.88 % has seen a major uptick, said Jenna Golden, head of political advertising sales at Twitter.\n\nIn the past, presidential campaigns have relied heavily on traditional media, notably TV ads to get out the vote. While political ad spending on TV is expected to rise this year, digital media has also become a crucial slice of the pie as people spend more time on Web-connected devices and digital ad targeting becomes more sophisticated. With Iowans the first in the country to vote this primary season, the state is crucial for the leading candidates, not only to start accumulating votes but also to build up their perceived legitimacy among voters in other states and potential campaign donors.\n\nBoth races are fairly tight, and recently Mr. Sanders pulled within three points of Mrs. Clinton in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll. On the right, Mr. Cruz is trying to reclaim the lead in Iowa after he was passed up by Donald Trump.\n\nMr. Cruz's campaign has been particularly aggressive in digital advertising, especially on YouTube. The campaign is spending 20% of its media budget on digital ads, said a person familiar with the matter, and half of that is going toward Web video ads.\n\nChris Wilson, director of research and analytics for the Cruz campaign, said that he's focusing much of the video ad efforts toward TrueView ads on YouTube. Those are the ads that people can skip over after five seconds, and advertisers only pay when people watch them in full.\n\nHe said those ads offer the closest parallel to the power to persuade voters offered by classic TV ads, but the YouTube ads allow for much better targeting. And while the campaign is advertising on Facebook, FB 2.84 % he said he prefers YouTube ads, since they are typically watched by viewers with the sound on.\n\n\"On Facebook, you usually don't stop and turn the sound on\" when you encounter a video, he said. \"YouTube ads are a little more like campaign ads, and they offer a realistic way to pay for it.\"\n\nPlus, Mr. Wilson said the Cruz campaign is able to target these video ads with custom messages to key constituencies, like voters who strongly support the second amendment right to bear arms. Working with the data firm Targeted Victory, the Cruz team has developed 178 different consumer data segments to use when determining which ads to show to specific Web users. Mr. Wilson said that a previous campaign he worked on in 2014 employed only eight such segments.\n\nAt this point, he's lost track of how many video ads the Cruz campaign is actually running. \"There are probably hundreds at this point,\" Mr. Wilson said.\n\nRight now, Mr. Cruz is looking to engineer a surprise win in Iowa. Mr. Trump has the edge in Iowa among GOP presidential hopefuls, with a lead of 32%-25% over Mr. Cruz, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist Poll conducted Jan. 24-26. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.\n\nMr. Trump's campaign couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nThe candidates aren't the only ones using the power of digital targeting to home in on Iowa residents. Ms. Golden said super PACs -- specifically Right to Rise, which is supporting Jeb Bush, and Keep the Promise 1 and Keep the Promise 2, which are supporting Mr. Cruz -- have ramped up their spending on Twitter.\n\n\"In some cases we're seeing more spend from the PACs than the actual candidates,\" Ms. Golden said. \"They are moving away from some of the traditional advertising where there can be a lot of waste.\"\n\nThe groups utilize Twitter's specific ad targeting system, which allows a campaign or super PAC to target based on geography or interest group. Email lists can be uploaded and then matched to Twitter accounts and ads can be directed to those users as well. Right to Rise has fewer than 2,000 Twitter followers -- but it can still reach thousands of Twitter users with a well-placed ad.\n\n\"When it's paid, it doesn't matter,\" Ms. Golden said. \"They can target anything. It actually makes the barrier to entry pretty easy.\"\n\nOn the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are battling it out in Iowa. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist Iowa survey shows Mrs. Clinton with 48% support and Mr. Sanders with 45%, a difference inside the margin of error.\n\nMrs. Clinton has three digital-only video ads that she is running on YouTube aimed at Iowa voters. The campaign is using Web video to amplify its considerable TV ad volume by targeting specific voters with messages focused on issues like women's reproductive rights and Mrs. Clinton's work toward protecting families. One video ad is being targeted specifically at people the Clinton campaign has deemed \"likely caucus voters,\" said a person familiar with the matter. It features a local Iowa couple talking about the importance of caucusing.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Sanders, who recently rolled out a unique nine-day ad campaign on Snapchat, is also dialing up his YouTube ad presence. One ad, a video dubbed \"America,\" generated over 2.5 million views in just six days (a number none of Mrs. Clinton's ads have come close to). The 60-second clip features Mr. Sanders appearing before big crowds on the campaign trail set to the tune of Simon & Garfunkel's \"America.\"\n\nMr. Sanders' team has also created an app for Apple TV, which compiles several of his YouTube videos for people to watch in their living rooms.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com",

                    "body": "Spending in presidential race goes beyond television and radio to newer (and sometimes questionable) techniques.\n\nMore than $167 million has already been spent on television and radio ads in the presidential race, but the candidates and their supportive super PACs likely have combined to spend far more than that on other political campaign essentials such as staff salaries, direct mail, digital ads and yard signs, according to a POLITICO analysis.\n\nIt will start becoming clear on midnight Sunday which campaigns and super PACs built the most robust and sustainable operations. That's the deadline for candidates and the super PACs devoted them to file reports with the Federal Election Commission detailing their finances through the end of 2015.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut a POLITICO analysis of other data identified at least $130 million in spending on things other than television and radio ads. The analysis relied on thousands of so-called \"independent expenditure\" reports that super PACs, PACs, non-profit groups and party committees are required to file with the FEC each time they spend money to support or oppose any federal candidate by name. It also used data on television and radio ad buys in the presidential race -- aggregated by The Tracking Firm -- which it subtracted from the disbursements made by the presidential campaign through the end of September.\n\nTaken together, the analysis offers tantalizing clues about strategies that candidates and their allies pursued in the run-up to the voting kickoff on Monday with Iowa's pivotal caucuses.\n\nDigital ads were a key focus for super PACs supporting presidential candidates, which reported spending a combined total of more than $10 million on advertising on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google and the like.\n\nA super PAC supporting Marco Rubio's campaign for the GOP nomination, Conservative Solutions PAC, led the way, dropping $2.5 million on such ads. While most of the spending went to ads extolling Rubio's virtues, more than $800,000 was spent on ads attacking rivals Chris Christie (who was the target of $480,000 of the super PAC's digital advertising), Ted Cruz ($311,000) and Donald Trump ($13,000).\n\nRight to Rise USA, the super PAC supporting Jeb Bush, spent $1.2 million on digital ads -- all of which went towards trying to boost the former Florida governor's flagging campaign for the GOP nomination, as opposed to attacking his rivals. That's quite a contrast from Right to Rise's television campaign which has included millions of dollars in ads attacking candidates vying with Bush for support from the Republican establishment, including Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\nOther major spenders on digital ads were a family of super PACs supporting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's GOP campaign. The PACs, all of which have variations of the name Keep the Promise, spent $890,000 on costs related to digital advertising. They combined to spend $332,000 on payments to a company called Cambridge Analytica, which specializes in building what it calls \"psychographic\" profiles of voters to try to win them over with narrowly targeted micro-messages.\n\nThe firm -- which is owned partly by Cruz's biggest super PAC donor, New York hedge fund manager Bob Mercer -- also is doing business with Cruz's campaign. It owed Cambridge Analytica $556,000 for \"survey research\" and \"donor modeling\" through the end of June -- the period covered by the campaign's most recent FEC filings. The filings due Sunday night are expected to show that Cruz, who has boasted of his appeal to the overlapping demographics that comprise the GOP base, did significant additional business with the firm.\n\nData, which forms the backbone for all manner of voter outreach techniques, was a major expenditure for a number of super PACs playing the presidential campaign.\n\nThe super PACs supporting Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul paid a combined $176,000 for voter files (and various interfaces to make use of the information, including phone banking services) to i360, a data firm owned by the Koch brothers' political operation.\n\nAll told, super PACs and other outside groups spent more than $2.5 million on phone banking, robo-calls and other phone-related expenses to persuade voters in the presidential race, according to POLITICO's analysis. An overwhelming majority of that -- $1.7 million -- was spent on phone calls opposing Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\nClinton was also the target of $768,000 in reported direct mail attacks by conservative groups including one PAC called Stop Hillary and another affiliated with Citizens United, the group that brought the lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court ruling that paved the way for super PACs. Direct mail, which is often a much costlier form of voter contact than digital advertising, is nonetheless considered an effective technique for reaching older voters.\n\nOverall, conservative outside groups reported spending $6 million attacking Clinton using various means, while liberal groups, including labor unions and groups supporting gay rights and abortion rights, reported spending only $1 million supporting her.\n\nClinton's allies have long been concerned that the main super PAC supporting her, Priorities USA Action, will not be able to match the fundraising of big-money conservative groups opposing her. Priorities USA raised $16 million in the first half of 2015 -- compared to $103 million raised by the pro-Bush Right to Rise -- though the pro-Clinton group is expected to report before the Sunday deadline that it raised more in the second half of the year than in the first.\n\nTrump, the real estate showman who has maintained a surprisingly large lead over the GOP pack, was targeted by $4.4 million in attacks from both liberal outside groups like Priorities USA and unions, as well as conservative groups. The fiscally conservative Club for Growth Action reported spending $1.1 million on online and television ads attacking Trump, while a new anti-Trump super PAC started by a former Mitt Romney aide has reported spending $1.8 million on direct mail and online and television ads trying to knock down Trump.\n\nAnd, while Trump boasts that he doesn't have a super PAC and is not beholden to big donors who fund such vehicles, a trio of PACs have in fact reported spending $513,000 supporting him. Much of that spending, though appears to be from groups that spend a majority of their money on fundraising and consulting fees, such as the Conservative Action Fund, which has been widely derided as a so-called scam PAC. Dan Backer, the fund's lawyer, treasurer and strategist, has rejected the label, noting that it costs money to raise money.\n\n\"Fundraising is the B-side of every political communication. Unless you've got huge-dollar donors, which would be nice, but isn't the case here,\" Backer says. \"To call political communications that include fundraising requests to further that communication as somehow nothing more than a fundraising request is a shallow perspective.\"\n\nThe Democrats' leading anti-establishment candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also decries super PACs and other big-money groups. But FEC reports show that a quartet of groups that can accept unlimited donations have spent $1.1 million supporting him.\n\nNational Nurses United for Patient Protection, the super PAC connected to the nation's largest union of registered nurses, has reported spending more than $1 million on ads, rallies and other voter outreach in support of Sanders. The group is paying for a bus tour that's been crisscrossing Iowa stumping for Sanders. It's become such a presence on the trail that Sanders during a Sunday thanked its members \"for their support in my campaign\" and called National Nurses United \"one of the sponsors of my campaign and I appreciate that.\"\n\nSmaller pro-Sanders expenditures came from the non-profit groups Democratic Socialists of America, Inc., Friends of the Earth Action and Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action Fund. They have spent nearly $80,000 combined on mailers, t-shirts, bumper stickers and organizing-related costs to support Sanders, but have not been a major visible presence on the trail.\n\nAmong the big-money 2016 players that have drawn the most puzzlement is a super PAC supporting retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson's fading campaign for the GOP nomination. The 2016 Committee has spent more than $1 million on all manner of knickknacks -- from $272,000 on clothing, mugs and magnets to $375,000 on books and audio books. As POLITICO revealed, most of the payments for books were to purchase copies of a book written by the super PAC's chairman John Philip Sousa IV, which were to be distributed to the committee's field staff.",

They collect money directly for their campaigns but also have outside political groups backing them: \"super\" political action committees and tax-exempt nonprofits.\n\nCampaign donations are capped, while super PACs and nonprofits can accept unlimited dollars. Campaigns and super PACs must disclose their donors, but nonprofits can keep them secret. Here's how much each candidate has raised since they announced their presidential candidacy earlier this year. \"Other\" includes nonprofits. These graphics reflect total fundraising through Sept. 30.\n\nSuper PACs attract wealthy donors who can write big checks to the committees, which can't coordinate with a candidate's campaign. Here are the top contributors in South Florida - consisting of Miami-Dade and Broward counties - Florida and the nation to super PACs backing Bush and Rubio:\n\nSince they announced their bids for president - Rubio in April and Bush in June - the two have received more than $38 million in campaign contributions nationwide. This is money given to candidates, not super PACs. About $34 million came from donors who gave more than $200, also known as itemized donations. Campaigns do not have to reveal information about donors who give less than $200.\n\nStatewide itemized campaign contributions\n\nThe map below shows the difference in itemized campaign money Bush and Rubio received from donors in Florida. Bush is outraising Rubio in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. Rubio has more support on Florida's west coast.\n\nNationwide\n\nThe candidates are also competing for donors nationwide. So far, Bush is leading in most big-money states, including Florida, Texas, California and New York. Rubio is leading in the swing state of Ohio.",

                    "body": "Released within hours of each other, the similarly themed spots show how campaigns and outside groups can spread the same message without violating the law.\n\nTed Cruz's campaign and a pair of super-PACs have started spreading the news about Donald J. Trump's \"New York values,\" running strikingly similar political ads in Iowa that illustrate how independent outside groups can amplify a campaign's message without running afoul of the law.\n\nThe anti-Trump spots feature clips from a 1999 interview the billionaire gave to NBC's Meet the Press. Cruz's campaign ad and one by Stand for Truth, one of the super-PACs supporting the Texas senator's presidential campaign, both begin with the billionaire developer's observation to Tim Russert that \"he's lived in Manhattan all his life\" and that his values are \"different than if I lived in Iowa.\" They also highlight Trump's remark in response to a question from Russert on partial-birth abortion, to which Trump eventually responds, \"I am pro-choice in every respect.\" Another pro-Cruz super-PAC called Keep the Promise I is running its own ad that bores down on Trump's \"pro-choice\" response. Like the other two ads, which hit the same notes, it hammers home the takeaway message that Trump is \"not a conservative.\"\n\nYouTube: TV Ad: New York Values\n\nCruz's campaign and the two super-PACs all posted their ads to YouTube on Monday, January 25. According to data from Kantar Campaign Media Analysis Group, which follows political advertising on broadcast and cable outlets, the two super-PACs ran their ads the same day, with the spot sponsored by Stand for Truth running in Iowa while Keep the Promise I aired its ad in South Carolina. The Cruz campaign's \"New York values\" ad first aired in Iowa on Tuesday.\n\nThough all three ads use the same footage to make the same point at the same time -- the final week before the Iowa caucuses -- they're perfectly legal under the current campaign finance system.\n\nUnlike candidates, super-PACs, a byproduct of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, can raise funds in unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations and labor unions. To prevent their big donors from influencing candidates, super-PACs are required to operate independently of campaigns. They even file a statement with the Federal Election Commission saying they won't support candidates or committees with contributions or through \"coordinated communications.\"\n\nEven with those restrictions, presidential candidates quickly realized the value of having a super-PAC on their side. Campaign aides of Mitt Romney created Restore Our Future, which supported the Massachusetts governor in his 2012 bid for the White House, in October 2010. Since then, with a few exceptions including Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders, candidates seeking the White House get a helping hand from a closely allied super-PAC.\n\nAnd as long as campaigns and their super-PAC counterparts adhere to some narrowly drawn rules, there's no violation of federal election law.\n\nThere are a few ways a super-PAC can be shown to have coordinated with a campaign -- for example, if it republishes materials created by a campaign. Restore Our Future was fined $50,000 in December 2015 for using almost in its entirety an ad created and aired by Romney's 2008 presidential committee.\n\nBut the three ads hammering Trump begin with footage produced by a third party: Meet the Press. And that's a distinction that makes a huge difference.\n\n\"The material in these ads came from a private media company,\" said Paul S. Ryan, deputy executive director of the Campaign Legal Center, which filed the complaint against Restore Our Future over its use of the old Romney ad.\n\nBecause the campaign and the super-PACs could independently acquire the same footage from a third party, there is no proof of coordination. \"Clearly, what we're seeing here is a campaign sticking out some messaging and that messaging being copied,\" Ryan said.\n\nBecause the super-PAC ads aren't carbon copies of Cruz's ad, there's no foul. That means to prove coordination, there has to be proof of conduct.\n\n\"There has to be actual interaction between the candidate and the outside spender,\" Ryan said. \"The conduct standards are pretty tough to meet for a regulator.\"\n\nAnd that's one reason why so few complaints brought to the FEC about coordination between super-PACs and campaigns have resulted in penalties. Though the rules are intended to keep them apart, it's easy for a super-PAC, funded by donations that a candidate couldn't accept, to support a message created by his campaign.\n\n\"More than corporate influence on elections, the bigger impact of Citizens United is the 'non-coordination' coordination between candidates and independent groups,\" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies money in politics.\n\n\"Campaigns and their surrogates are able to stay on the right side of the law without honoring the spirit of the law,\" she said.\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

Ted Cruz's run for the Republican presidential nomination has purchased $2.5 million of television ads.\n\nThe super PAC is called Keep the Promise I. Its new ads begin Tuesday in the leadoff primary state of Iowa, and next week in third-to-vote South Carolina.\n\nThe ads come as Cruz appears to be picking up steam in the still-crowded primary.\n\nThe commercials supplement other efforts by four super PACs that use the name \"Keep the Promise.\" Together, those groups have raised $37 million to help Cruz.\n\nThe message of the new ad echoes Cruz's campaign theme that he has stood up to Democrats and Republicans. It includes clips of Cruz at some of his own campaign appearances, and features people asserting he can be trusted.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
