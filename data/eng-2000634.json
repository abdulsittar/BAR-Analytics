                    "body": "Fifteen years ago, if you were a woman in Afghanistan, you could be beaten for laughing in public or if your shoes made noise. You could be beaten or killed for going out alone, unaccompanied by a male guardian. Covered by burqas, women became strangers. Waiting in bread lines in Kabul, they learned to recognise each other from the sound of their voices and the faces of male children with them. Today, one of those women, Nasima Rahmani, is a leading lawyer and educator, working toward her PhD.\n\nAnd she is not alone. Women in Afghanistan are changing their lives and their nation. Fifteen years ago, barely 5,000 girls were enrolled in primary school. Soon that number will exceed 3 million. Thirty-six percent of teachers are women. Afghanistan's first lady, Rula Ghani, has launched a project to establish a female-only university, run by women. In government, women hold 69 seats in parliament. There are four female government ministers and two female provincial governors. Thousands of women have started their own businesses.\n\nOn Tuesday, International Women's Day, the George W Bush Institute is releasing a new book, \"We Are Afghan Women: Voices of Hope.\" The book recounts inspiring stories such as Rahmani's, reminding us of both the challenges Afghan women have endured and the incredible successes they have achieved.\n\nIt is hard to find another country where women have made such substantial gains against such overwhelming odds in so short a time. In the United States, women won the right to vote in 1920, but it wasn't until 1969 that nearly all of the elite Ivy League universities started admitting women. By 1961, only 20 women were serving in Congress. In the age of Twitter and Instagram, it can be hard to remember that real change takes time.\n\nWe should not underestimate the challenges that women in Afghanistan still face. Later this month, the country will observe the one-year anniversary of the brutal mob murder of a young woman named Farkhunda, who was falsely accused of burning a Koran. There are regular reports of attacks on girls' schools and attacks on female students. Last July, three girls, ages 16 through 18, had acid thrown in their faces as they walked to school in Herat province. Violence against women remains a serious problem.\n\nYet I am hopeful. I am hopeful because of the skills, determination and abilities of Afghanistan's women.\n\nWhen Sakena Yacoobi stood in a filthy, crowded Afghan refugee camp, she knew the one thing that every Afghan needed was an education. She opened 15 schools for 21,000 refugees. Today, one of her programs in Afghanistan teaches women to read, write and do math using cellphones. Naheed Farid, a young member of Afghanistan's parliament, faced death threats when she ran for office. Her face was cut out of campaign posters and opponents promised to dishonor her father-in-law's family. But her husband and father-in-law insisted she continue. Now she advocates for women and children and serves on the parliament's international relations committee.\n\nAfghanistan is at a crossroads. It is a global hot spot that before 9/11 became a terrorist haven, and it is a young country: The median age is 18.3 years. US policy in Afghanistan must be consistent. Afghanistan is a resilient society. The best way to build on this resilience is to be predictable in our support. If the United States turns its back on Afghanistan, other forces will step in to erase the hard-won but fragile gains that have been made.\n\nWe can and must help Afghanistan create a better future. We need to ensure that Afghanistan cannot again become a terrorist haven or fall to the Taliban or the Islamic State. In the interest of our own national security, we must assist Afghan security forces. I welcome President (Barack) Obama's decision to maintain a US military presence through 2016 and beyond. We know, and the Afghan people know, that we will not have troops in Afghanistan forever, but the country remains fragile, and the cost of leaving Afghanistan is too high.\n\nWe, and the entire international community, should continue to provide significant development assistance in the areas of health care, entrepreneurship and education. We know this assistance works. A 2013 Rand Corporation study found Afghanistan's metrics have improved in nearly every area of development. By maintaining our presence and support, we are encouraging the Afghan government to keep its security commitments to the Afghan people and to build on economic and anti-corruption reforms and the rule of law. That is why it is critically important that any peace achieved through negotiations between Afghan leaders and the Taliban is not made at the expense of Afghan women. A return to policies that made the Taliban notorious in the 1990s would be traumatic not just for women but also for the stability of the country.\n\nWe must never forget that what happens in Afghanistan - and elsewhere in the world - matters to us here at home. The Afghan people are not asking us to solve their problems; they are asking us to remain engaged so that they have the space and opportunity to create their own solutions. As American University of Afghanistan's first female valedictorian, Onaba Payab, told me: \"This is a reminder that we are not alone in those tough places, that there are people who care about us.\"\n\nThe writer is an honourary co-chair of the US-Afghan Women's Council and chair of the Women's Initiative at the George W Bush Institute.",

Similarly, TTP Bajaur commander Moulvi Faqir Muhammad made his way into Afghanistan the same year.\n\nThe Pakistan government has time and again raised the issue with its Afghan counterpart. The Afghan government, while acknowledging the presence of TTP chief Fazalullah, said these TTP militants were using the most inaccessible border regions in Afghanistan and had survived a couple of attacks by the Afghan security forces.",

                    "body": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has, on a number of occasions, floated proposals to better manage its border with Afghanistan to curb illegal movement into either country. However, officials claim these plans have never reached fruition owing to a lukewarm response from Afghanistan.\n\nThe cross-border movement of militants is one of the major sticking points in Pak-Afghan relations. Both countries have repeatedly accused the other of failing to maintain strict border controls, particularly when any terrorist attack takes place on either side.\n\nDurand, Durand\n\nAgainst this backdrop of mistrust, some Afghan leaders view Pakistan's border management proposals as an attempt to have the Durand Line recognised as an international border. Pakistan insists the Durand Line is a closed chapter. However, the Afghan government believes it remains a disputed matter.\n\nSeveral countries have thrown their weight behind Pakistan's stance on the status of the nearly 2,600 kilometre border with Afghanistan.\n\nWhen Hamid Karzai rattled the border issue during his last months as president, Marc Grossman, America's then special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the US considers the Durand Line an internationally-accepted boundary.\n\nAt a standstill\n\nPakistan and Afghanistan had been part of a trilateral border coordination system with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) until foreign troops ended their combat mission in 2014. Yet both countries have failed to set up bilateral coordination centres at Torkham and Chaman.\n\nAs per Pakistani officials, they have no reservations about establishing coordination centres. The problem, they say, stems from Afghanistan.\n\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune in Kabul last week, former Afghan army chief Gen Sher Mohammad Karimi said, \"The border stretches through rugged mountains. It is difficult [to control] but not impossible.\"\n\nHe added, \"It is [only] possible when both [countries] join hands and there is a mutual understanding. We should not make excuses.\"\n\nAccording to Karimi, border forces in Pakistan should control their side of the boundary, stop cross-border movement, and help Afghan troops. \"Our border force is in its formative stages,\" he said. \"They will need some more time to emerge as a strong force.\"\n\nThe former army chief said, \"Both forces should share intelligence and develop a better understanding to deal with enemies.\"\n\nBone of contention\n\nPakistani officials believe they have established hundreds of check posts on their side; Afghanistan has only 80.\n\n\"We are asking for an effective bilateral border coordination and efficient communication system with Afghanistan,\" a government official told The Express Tribune. \"We have discussed several proposals, but Afghanistan's response is discouraging.\"\n\nAccording to the official, a proper system will mainly benefit Afghan nationals trying to enter Pakistan. \"Between 40,000 to 60,000 people cross the Pak-Afghan border every day,\" the official said. \"Most of them are Afghan nationals. However, the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul, and its four consulates, only issue around 2,000 visas daily.\"\n\nHe added, \"Many Afghan nationals are crossing the border on the basis of proof of registration cards and do not have any documents. Terrorists on either side take advantage [of the situation] if there is no proper deterrent.\"\n\nAccording to the official, Pakistan has planned to open more trade routes through Chitral and Dir. Customs and immigration systems will be put in place to boost bilateral trade.\n\n\"But the Afghan government is reluctant to agree to our proposals on the flimsy excuse that Pakistan considers [the Durand Line] an international border,\" he said.\n\nAnother Pakistani official told The Express Tribune the country may opt for a series of measures on its side of the border to prevent illegal cross-border movement if Kabul is unwilling to reach an understanding.\n\nHe added that the deadliest terrorist attacks were orchestrated by militants from Afghanistan, and that unilateral measures were required.",

It will also add eight to 10 MD-530 armed helicopters -- which the general referred to as \"little birds\" -- to the Afghan air arsenal this fighting season.\n\n\"Those have made a difference in Nangahar, in Helmand,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the United States and NATO must still build, train and advise Afghan attack controllers needed to direct the action of their combat aircraft during offensive operations.\n\nThese controllers are required to positively identify targets and help prevent civilian casualties.",

John Campbell, who stepped down as commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan last week, said he has been encouraged by the Afghan forces' improvements over time.\n\nStill, Campbell said he is concerned about shortcomings such as a general reluctance to leave checkpoints and go on the offensive against Taliban fighters, who often are outgunned.\n\n\"It will be a very, very tough year for the Afghans unless they\" make changes such as taking a more offensive approach on the battlefield and improving the quality of their military leaders, Campbell said in an interview with reporters at the Pentagon.\n\nThe Afghan forces took heavy losses last year, which was their first full year of fighting without U.S. troops in combat alongside them.\n\nCampbell gave up command in Afghanistan on Mar. 2 and is due to retire from the Army on May 1. His successor is Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr.\n\nCampbell, a U.S. Military Academy graduate who has served in uniform for nearly 37 years, said he turned down an offer from Defense Secretary Ash Carter to be nominated as the next commander of U.S. Africa Command. He called it a personal decision.",

                    "body": "U.S. Army General John F. Campbell, who recently stepped down as commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, at a news conference at in Kabul, Afghanistan. (Omar Sobhani/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nThe outgoing commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan pressed civilian leaders in the months before he left Kabul to expand the American role there, shedding light on what he called a slow and inefficient decision-making process as he prepares to retire.\n\nGen. John F. Campbell declined to detail the recommendations he had made to senior leaders before he stepped down earlier this month, but suggested that the United States may need to expand advisory missions with Afghan ground troops and take additional actions against the Taliban, which is seeking to expand attacks against local forces.\n\n\"If you want to have pressure, if you want to drive [the Taliban] toward reconciliation ... I would believe they need to have more pressure put on them,\" Campbell said. \"One way to do it would be potentially striking.\"\n\n\"Now, I'm not advocating for 'Let's go back and be committed to a total war against the Taliban' ... but that is one way to go after them,\" he said. He declined to provide additional details about the nature of his proposed actions against the group.\n\nCampbell, who spoke to reporters at the Pentagon about his nearly 37 years in the U.S. Army and his tenure as the top American general in Afghanistan, hangs up his uniform as the U.S. military grapples with a sharp deterioration in security across Afghanistan, where Taliban and other militants are seeking to expand gains against local forces.\n\nThe modest U.S. force of 9,800 troops is now assigned to a dual mission, advising local forces and conducting counter-terrorism operations against al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. Under a plan announced by President Obama in 2014, that force is due to be reduced to just 5,500 servicemembers by early next year.\n\nCampbell expressed satisfaction at a series of White House decisions over the past year and a half that allowed him to adjust the U.S. mission to reflect both the ongoing weaknesses of Afghanistan's military, and the continued strength of the Taliban. He cited a series of steps approved by Obama since fall 2014, including authorization of certain combat activities; permission to strike the Islamic State's Afghanistan cell; and several moves to retain a larger U.S. force for more time.\n\nBut the general also voiced frustration at what he characterized as a painfully slow process chaired by the White House, which he said would often review potential actions in repeated meetings. Campbell said he sat in on so-called deputy-level, or sub-Cabinet, meetings, Cabinet-level meetings and full National Security Council meetings, often late into the night as he tuned in from Afghanistan.\n\n\"There were times I would say why are we going over this again - I've already laid it out.\" But, Campbell said, \"every time I got to President Obama I got the decision I was really looking for.\"\n\n\"The frustration was just the process we have but ... it was kind of good and bad at the same time,\" he said.\n\nCampbell suggested that his successor, Gen. John \"Mick\" Nicholson, might take up the case for his pending military recommendations.\n\n\"I think sort of the same things I asked for ... again I don't want to speak for him, but I think he'd probably reemphasize those,\" he said. \"But I want to make sure we can get them done in a timely manner. Otherwise it's not going to impact [2016]\" he said.\n\nCampbell said Afghan forces continue to lack basic military functions - intelligence, logistics, and air power - but had proved themselves a capable fighting force.\n\nCampbell said the Obama administration had offered him a chance following his Afghanistan position to become the next head of U.S. Africa Command; its commander Gen. David M. Rodriguez is stepping down later this year. But Campbell said he declined for personal reasons.",

                    "body": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has, on a number of occasions, floated proposals to better manage its border with Afghanistan to curb illegal movement into either country. However, officials claim these plans have never reached fruition because they have not received a positive response from Afghanistan.\n\nThe cross-border movement of militants is one of the major sticking points in Pak-Afghan relations. Both countries have repeatedly accused the other of failing to maintain strict border controls, particularly when any terrorist attack takes place on either side.\n\nDurand, Durand\n\nAgainst this backdrop of mistrust, some Afghan leaders view Pakistan's border management proposals as an attempt to have the Durand Line recognised as an international border. Pakistan insists the Durand Line is a closed chapter. However, the Afghan government believes it remains a disputed matter.\n\nSeveral countries have thrown their weight behind Pakistan's stance on the status of the nearly 2,600 kilometre border with Afghanistan.\n\nWhen Hamid Karzai rattled the border issue in his last months as president, Marc Grossman, who was then America's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said US considers the Durand Line an internationally-accepted boundary.\n\nAt a standstill\n\nPakistan and Afghanistan had been part of a trilateral border coordination system with International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) until foreign troops ended their combat mission in 2014. But both countries have failed to set up bilateral coordination centres at Torkham and Chaman.\n\nAs per Pakistani officials, they have no reservations about establishing coordination centres. The problem, they say, stems from Afghanistan.\n\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune in Kabul last week, former Afghan army chief General Sher Mohammad Karimi said, \"The border stretches through rugged mountains. It is difficult [to control] but not impossible.\"\n\nHe added, \"It is [only] possible when both [countries] join hands and there is a mutual understanding. We should not make excuses.\" According to Karimi, border forces in Pakistan should control their side of the boundary, stop the cross-border movement and help Afghan troops. \"Our border force is in its formative stages,\" he said. \"They will need some more time to emerge as a strong force.\" The former army chief said, \"Both forces should share intelligence and develop a better understanding to deal with enemies.\"\n\nBone of contention\n\nPakistani officials believe they have established hundreds of check posts on their side; Afghanistan has only 80.\n\n\"We are asking for an effective bilateral border coordination and efficient communication system with Afghanistan,\" a government official told The Express Tribune. \"We have discussed several proposals but Afghanistan's response is discouraging.\"\n\nAccording to the official, a proper system will mainly benefit Afghan nationals trying to enter Pakistan. \"Between 40,000 to 60,000 people cross the Pak-Afghan border every day,\" the official said. \"Most of them are Afghan nationals. However, the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul and its four consulates only issue around 2,000 visas daily.\"\n\nHe added, \"Many Afghan nationals are crossing the border on the basis of proof of registration (POR) cards and do not have any documents. Terrorists on either side take advantage [of the situation] if there is no proper deterrent.\"\n\nAccording to the official, Pakistan has planned to open more trade routes through Chitral and Dir. Customs and immigration systems will be put in place to boost bilateral trade.\n\n\"But the Afghan government is reluctant to agree to our proposals on the flimsy excuse that Pakistan considers [the Durand Line] an international border,\" he said.\n\nAnother Pakistani official told The Express Tribune the country may opt for a series of measures on its side of the border to prevent illegal cross-border movement if Kabul is unwilling to reach an understanding.",

                    "title": "Pakistan May Have Jeopardized the Latest Afghan Peace Talks",
                    "body": "Failure of the Afghan peace process will harm Pakistan's credibility to a great extent.\n\nThe Afghan peace process, which is being facilitated by various regional states, has once again hit a roadblock with the Afghan Taliban refusing to hold direct peace talks with the Afghan government. A statement issued by the Afghan Taliban recently stressed several long-standing preconditions for dialogue, including the departure of all foreign troops from Afghanistan. \"We want to repeat our stance once again that until the occupation of foreign troops ends, until Taliban names are removed from international blacklists, and until our detainees are released, talks will yield no results,\" the group said.\n\nDirect talks were expected to begin in Pakistan next week between the Taliban and Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, and the United States (the so-called Quadrilateral Coordination Group). Last year's attempt at talks dissolved after just one round, after Afghan intelligence announced that Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar had been dead for two years.\n\nIn a way, Pakistan may have jeopardized the latest round of talks. The Afghan Taliban's announcement came only a few days after Pakistani Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz, in a rare admission, said that Pakistan still had significant influence over the Afghan Taliban because the group's leadership is based in Pakistan. Previously, Pakistan has always denied any such claims.\n\nSpeaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, he said, \"I think people who have dealt with this issue recognize that Taliban in the best of times ... did not listen to Pakistan always ... and now we have some influence on them because their leadership is in Pakistan and they get some medical facilities, their families are here. So we can use those levers to pressurize them to say 'come to the table.'\"\n\nThis statement by the county's foreign affairs advisor has raised many questions. On Pakistan's part, the motives of this admission are unclear. If it was meant to bolster Pakistan's general position over the issue, it has clearly failed. And if it was meant to sabotage the peace process, it has succeeded in doing so.\n\nMoreover, by openly admitting that the Afghan Taliban's families live in the country, Pakistan has only officially acknowledged what has already been known: that the group enjoys state-level support in Pakistan. Moreover, it has further confirmed that Pakistan has been following a 'good' Taliban (non-state actors which do not target Pakistan's interests) and 'bad' Taliban (non-state actors which target Pakistan interests in any way) policy.\n\nStrategically, the Afghan Taliban is under no pressure to join any peace process. Since the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan a year ago, the Taliban have had many victories on the military front: insurgent activities increased considerably in the last year, with at least 10,000 security and terrorist incidents recorded in 2015 alone.\n\nThis latest refusal by the Taliban to join any dialogue has weakened Pakistan's position. From here on, Pakistan's credibility will further decline as it has not yet been able to deliver on the issue, despite making promises to do so at various forums.\n\nAziz's statement has led to more discontent in Kabul over the progress in the talks and particularly in Pakistan's role in bringing the Taliban to the table. Many claim that Pakistan has not been exerting real pressure on the Taliban, except advising them to join the peace talks. Ahmad Rashid, a journalist and an expert on Afghanistan, recently said that \"if the Afghan civil war worsens, Pakistan's allies, China and the United States, will lose faith in Islamabad's intentions.\"\n\nThe Taliban have even promised to launch more attacks because of the growing number of foreign troops in the country. In the coming days and weeks, the security situation of Afghanistan is likely to deteriorate further, which will only put more pressure on Pakistan.\n\nMake no mistake: the stability of the region depends on the outcome of this peace process and Pakistan needs to take a clear position on it.",

He said not only Pakistan, but Iran, Russia and some central Asian countries had their proxies in Afghanistan. The option of proxies was a weak option for Pakistan because other neighbouring countries - richer and more powerful - would also use their proxies here, he commented. He said grave mistakes were committed in the Afghan policy. He said in Kashmir the national movement of the Kashmiri people was radicalised but now the Jihadi factor in Kashmir was much weaker. In order to help Afghan Taliban, Pakistan isolated had itself, he opined. He said Gen Musharraf helped in regrouping Afghan Taliban but it did not help. \"As a result of this policy, we saw the birth of the Pakistani Taliban who wanted to overthrow the Pakistani state.\"\n\nAhmed Rashid said that majority of Afghan Taliban leaders resided in Pakistan; however, the Pakistani Taliban easily took shelter in Afghan Taliban controlled areas of Afghanistan. He said: \"It is a dichotomy that we are hosting Afghan Taliban and the Afghan Taliban are hosting the Pakistani Taliban. The Pakistani government has failed to exert pressure on the Afghan Taliban to hold talks with Kabul. The policy of carrot and stick is necessary for bringing peace in Afghanistan.\"\n\nHe said: \"The military situation in Afghanistan is getting worse. If the situation is not controlled within two to three months, a major town or a province would be captured by the Afghan Taliban and it would have a domino effect. A couple of more provinces would soon fall and there would be panic in Kabul. Taliban have already showed their strength by capturing Kunduz and they have good influence in Helmand. If the town of Lashkar Gah is captured by the Taliban, it will change the whole situation. There is a grave political crisis is Afghanistan. Her government and army are yet to fully function despite the passage of two years. The crisis seems to be growing in Afghanistan. If any American casualty occurred in Afghanistan, the American people will demand withdrawal of their forces. The USA committed grave mistakes in Afghanistan. Their major mistake was to leave Afghanistan too early to go for Iraq. The USA committed the same mistake in Iraq also,\" Rashid said.",

                    "body": "Afghanistan is known as \"the graveyard of empires,\" as it is famous for humiliating those who seek to occupy it. This includes the efforts of the Soviet Union in the '80s, as well as those of the British Empire during the 19th century, and their forced withdrawal after losing what seemed at first an easy victory. The American news network CNN concluded [in recent coverage] by saying, \"Indeed, the American forces now know that the Taliban are playing a game of time with them.\"*\n\nDays before the war was undertaken by the United States against the Taliban in Afghanistan -- which would cost the American taxpayers $3 billion, in addition to the dread experienced by the international forces there, as well as by the Afghan citizens due to Taliban attacks -- CNN aired a report begging the question, \"What is achieved by fighting the war against this organization?!\" The channel also said in its presentation that the losses suffered by Western forces include the deaths of 3,500 soldiers. In addition, tens of thousands of Afghanis have died during the years of the war, which began in 2001. Further, last week, the Afghan forces withdrew from two locations in the Helmand Province, Lashkar Gah and Sangin, giving the Taliban the opportunity to impose its control over the remainder of the province.\n\nThe former Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan in 1978, but it faced fierce opposition from what are known as the Afghan Mujahedeen, as well as the Arab Mujahedeen, who joined them in what is known as a jihad against the Soviet occupation. These fighters succeeded, as they were supported by U.S. intelligence as well as financially supported by the governments of some Arab countries, which also encouraged young people to emigrate and join the ranks of the Mujahedeen. In the end, Soviet troops were forced to withdraw from Afghanistan. After the withdrawal, fighting between yesterday's allies within the Mujahedeen, as well as between parties, dominates the chaos in Afghanistan today. It was in this atmosphere that the Taliban emerged as students of the Sharia led by Mullah Muhammad Omar and quickly took control over vast areas of Afghanistan, including the capital, Kabul, where they proclaimed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Among the Arab fighters in the Afghan ranks was Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, who had moved there after leaving Sudan.\n\nThe movement has persisted in Afghanistan but has not been recognized, except by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, which later withdrew their recognition following the Sept.11, 2001attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center towers in New York. The U.S. president at the time, George Bush, demanded that the Taliban government hand over bin Laden and al-Qaida, claiming that they launched the attacks on the United States. Mullah Omar, the leader of the movement, demanded that the U.S. government provide proof of bin Laden's involvement. The U.S. response in October 2001 was to bomb and attack Afghanistan, as well as the formation of an international coalition in order to oust the Taliban government, which has since been achieved.\n\nHowever, the Taliban has not kept quiet. Rather, it has been fighting the U.S. forces, the coalition, as well as the Afghan government set up by the U.S. and international forces. The fighting continues today. The fact is that Taliban forces have become a major threat and are making progress in many areas; they are adept at hit-and-run operations and are familiar with the mountainous nature of Afghanistan. Therefore, their operations are diverse against the occupying forces and the Afghan government, and many deaths are to be expected given the repeated attacks on U.S. bases. Thus, imposed upon the U.S. and the Afghan government are negotiations with the Taliban in order to reach a consensual solution, which would make the movement a partner in the Afghan government, thus recognizing its strength. This is a matter that is being exploited and maneuvered by the movement. It recognizes the extent of the weakness of the Afghan government and its forces. It knows very well that the survival of the Afghan government is dependent on continued U.S. support and the presence of NATO forces.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the participating countries in the U.S-led .coalition have begun to announce the withdrawal of their troops. The result is clear: All of the years of war have not been able to eliminate the Taliban, as the U.S. had once predicted. The knowledge of the imminent withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan is something that increases the strength of the Taliban, and the decision to pounce on the current Afghan government has been made and will occur immediately after the withdrawal of those forces. This also pushes the Obama administration to work to escape from the quagmire of Afghanistan.\n\nThere are meetings from time to time between officials of the Afghan government and the Taliban in the Qatari capital, Doha, in order to reach a settlement. However, until now, there have been no serious and genuine negotiations between the two parties. In order to reach a settlement, the U.S. is paying in American lives for a face-saving way out of Afghanistan. This means an announcement of their miserable failure in achieving their goals of invading Afghanistan, the elimination of al-Qaida, and the elimination of the Taliban. However, the Taliban has remained and has become stronger since the beginning. Likewise, al-Qaida has remained, branched out, and has had an unprecedented spread not only within Afghanistan, but also into other Arab areas and organizations, such as the Islamic State, al-Nusra Front, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, Boko Haram and others. The U.S. policy failures and losses are evidenced by the lives lost by the occupying forces, the Afghan forces, and others, as well as by the number of those wounded and injured due to the war. Additionally, the billions that have been spent for the sake of winning the war in vain also evidence U.S. failure, as well as the image of the U.S. as a superpower with the strongest marine fleets, armies, and marine bases around the world that could not achieve its goals in Afghanistan. To defeat all of this and triumph, the militants must not be carrying simple, but unconventional weapons. America bites its fingers furiously over all that was spent and suffered in vain.\n\n*Editor's note: Correctly translated, this quote could not be verified.",

We will continue to play our positive role in this regard,\" he said\n\nThe Taliban leadership is believed to be sheltering and directing the Afghan insurgency from areas in and around Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, which shares a border with Afghanistan.\n\nFor years, Pakistan rejected Afghan and U.S. assertions that Taliban insurgents are using Pakistani soil for their insurgent activities.\n\nTaliban leaders in Pakistan\n\nLast week, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's adviser on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz, for the first time, publicly admitted that Taliban leaders are present in Pakistan and that leverage can be used to push them to the negotiating table for talks with the Afghan government.\n\n\"We have some influence on them because their leadership is in Pakistan, and they get some medical facilities; their families are here. So we can use those levers to pressurize them to say, 'Come to the table,'\" Aziz said at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.\n\nAfghan officials say Pakistan has assured a four-nation contact group, which includes China and the United States, that Islamabad will take action against Taliban insurgents on its soil who oppose political reconciliation with Kabul and want to continue with their violent campaign in Afghanistan.",

                    "body": "The former Afghan interior minister and ex-Ambassador to Pakistan Mohammad Omar Daudzai has questioned Pakistan's sincerity in Afghan peace process, saying Islamabad is approaching its own interests in the process.\n\nDaudzai was speaking during an event marking the 5th anniversary of the assassination of Mawlana Syed Kheli, the former police chief of northern Kunduz province of Afghanistan.\n\nRecalling his message to the government while leaving the office as the Minister of Interior, Daudzai said the government did not listen to his calls and that led to a waste of one and half year.\n\nHe warned the government that Pakistan is approaching its own interests in the Afghan peace process, saying \"Because they went via Pakistan. We have already been through that route, and we saw it. Pakistan was not ill yesterday so that they recover and step in to assist us.\"\n\nDaudzai also warned that the violence will continue as the negotiations in the format of Quadrilateral Coordination Group has ended in a deadlock, insisting that the Afghanistan issues need bilateral discussions.\n\nThe former minister pledged cooperation as he called on the government to find a intra-Afghan solution to the ongoing violence in the country, saying that would help and would be more easier.\n\nHe opposed giving more privilege to Pakistan to resolve the internal issues of Afghanistan and suggested that the issue should be resolved internally.\n\nThis comes as the Taliban group has rejected to sit-in for peace talks with the Afghan government, saying the decision to refrain from direct negotiations was taken due to deployment of troops by US to Afghanistan, ongoing airstrikes, and expansion of military operations by Afghan government amid ongoing efforts to revive peace talks, which the group called a 'propaganda'.",

                    "title": "When Afghan Women Were Free",
                    "body": "In the Ancient Greek poet Homer's epic poem The Iliad, the motive for the siege of Troy by the Greeks was the abduction of Helen, wife of the red-haired Menalaus by the lascivious Trojan prince Alexandros.\n\nYet Helen is strangely absent from Homer's epic. The poem is more concerned with the mobilisation of Greece's allies and the death, destruction and despair engendered by war. It is as though, the Helen myth is simply used to justify the wanton destruction of another people and the cultural superiority of the aggressors, who fight wars to protect women.\n\nPerhaps more than any other poem in the history of Western literature, Homer's Iliad is a foundation stone, a constitutive ur-myth of European civilisation.\n\nOne can find echoes of this ur-myth in the way the 15 year NATO occupation of Afghanistan is being represented to the French public. The occupation of Afghanistan is presented as an attempt to bring freedom and democracy to a backward and dangerous country populated by barbarians who are threatening the security of 'Western civilization'. In particular, NATO is occupying Afghanistan, we are led to believe, to protect Afghan women just as Homer's 'doughty Achaeans' invaded Troy to retrieve the beautiful Helen, rather than to rob and plunder another civilization.\n\nIn the weeks before the Afghanistan invasion in 2001, television viewers were bombarded with images showing the plight of Afghanistan women under Taliban rule. No one can deny the horror and degradation that Afghanistan women suffered under the Taliban. But the television and radio mignons of the word's corporate media outlets never explain how it came to pass that such draconian laws could be foisted upon a country in at the end of the twentieth century.\n\nLike Homer's Helen, Afghanistan's women remain passive and largely absent from the media narrative, and only become visible when we forget why we invaded the country in the first place. We are never told that Afghanistan women were once free and that it was we who put a brutal and ruthless end to their fledgling freedoms. We were never told that Women were free in Afghanistan long before Western intervention and that in fact it was Western intervention which enslaved Afghan women.\n\nOn the 11th of March 2010, the whistle blowing site Wikileaks released a classified CIA document entitled \"Afghanistan: Sustaining West European Support for the NATO-led Mission-Why Counting on Apathy Might Not Be Enough.\"\n\nThe recommendations of this CIA report were clearly visible in the following weeks throughout the French media. The war on Afghanistan has consistently been portrayed in the French media as a noble attempt by 'Western civilization' to save the women of that country from the Taliban. In this fictional portrayal, French soldiers could be likened to Homer's Greeks who are heroically attempting to rescue the beautiful Helen from brutal captivity of the Trojans.\n\nBefore examining the recommendations of the aforementioned CIA report, it is necessary to dispel some common myths about women's freedom in Afghanistan and the role of the West in 'liberating' them.\n\nAfghan women's rights and Western intervention\n\nFor centuries Afghanistan was ruled by Shahs in a complex and changing feudal system that reached its apogee during the Duranni empire of the 18th century.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century Afghanistan became the battleground for the first round of the Great Game between the British Empire and Czarist Russia. Afghanistan fought three wars against the British. Although the British did manage to gain hegemony over Afghanistan, British victories against rugged and hardy Central Asian nation were Pyrrhic, with catastrophic casualties.\n\nIn 1880 the British suffered a major defeat by Afghan forces in the Battle of Maiwand. A young Pashtun woman called Malalai would become a legend in Afghanistan for exhortation to the Afghan soldiers not to surrender \"Young love if you do not fall in the battle of Maiwand; By God someone is saving you as a token of shame\"\n\nMalalai is described by some as Afghanistan's Joan of Arc. In the same year Abdur Rahmen Khan acceded to the Afghan throne. Abdur Rahmen initiated reforms allowing women to inherit property and the right to divorce. From 1919 to the early 1930s major advances in women's rights were made under the leadership of King Amanullah Khan and his wife Queen Soraya.\n\nQueen Soraya set up the Anjuman-E-Himayat-E-Niswan (Organization for Women's Protection) in 1920 which provided a platform for women to report domestic abuse. The first women's magazine in Afghanistan Ershad-E-Niswan (Guidance for Women) was also initiated during this period.\n\nHowever, King Amanullah's friendly relations with the Soviet Union conflicted with British geopolitical interests in the region. Khan's liberal policies in regard to women of the Amanullah regime also made him deeply unpopular among conservative religious figures in the country.\n\nIn an operation that would be repeated a century later, British intelligence agents succeeded in manipulating religious opposition to Amanullah and the progressive king was overthrown in 1929. The British found a suitable replacement for Amanullah in 1933 when they provided military assistance to the religious conservative Mohammad Nadir Shah to seize power in Kabul.\n\nNadir Shah maintained power by pitching tribe against tribe in accordance with British divide and rule strategy and abolished many of Afghanistan's pro-women reforms, unleashing a reign of terror against Afghanistan's women.\n\nBritain's puppet would become the template for future Anglo-American policy in Afghanistan: Keep the country under control by backing retrograde religious forces. The freedom of Afghanistan's women would have to be subordinated to the interests of the British Empire in the region.\n\nWith the rise of Mohammad Zahir Shah in 1933, Afghanistan's women would see significant improvements in their social status. The first female secondary school was established in Kabul in 1941. Women were allowed to unveil from 1959 onward and in the 1964 constitution finally gave women the right to vote. It is worth noting that women in Switzerland did not attain the right to vote until 1977!\n\nThe Saur Revolution and women's liberation\n\nIn 1965 the Democratic Organisation of Afghan Women was formed to promote women's rights in Afghanistan. Although women had the right to vote, the gains of modernisation were largely confined to Kabul. Women in the countryside continued to be treated as private property by the deeply backward tribes that held sway throughout the illiterate countryside.\n\nDuring the 1960s Marxist revolutionary ideology began to spread among educated intellectuals in Kabul culminating in the formation of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan in 1965. However the party was split into two rival factions, khalq (masses) and Parcham (banner).\n\nInitially the People's Democratic Party participated in the secular regime of Mohammad Doud Khan. However, matters came to a head in 1978 after the assassination of Mir Akbar Khyber, Marxist intellectual and leader of the Parcham faction of the People's Democratic Party(PDPA).\n\nThe PDPA initially believed that the Doud regime was responsible for the assassination of Khyber. Many members of the Parcham faction would later claim that the assassination had been carried out at the behest of Hafizullah Amin, the US educated leader of the Khalq faction who many suspected to be working for the CIA in order to weaken the communist movement from within.\n\nAt the funeral of Khyber, thousands of PDPA supporters shouted anti-CIA slogans. The Doud regime feared a popular uprising and proceeded to arrest PDPA members. The PDPA, fearing for their lives, seized power on the 27th of April 1978 what became known as the Saur Revolution.\n\nWomen's rights were high on the national, democratic agenda. The democratic government introduced a radical education programme for women. This angered the traditional mullahs in the countryside and women often had to go to school with a book in one hand and a gun in the other in order to protect themselves from attacks by reactionary misogynists. The communist regime invited Soviet contractors and engineers to build roads, schools and hospitals.\n\nSoviet geologists discovered vast quantities of lithium and minerals in Afghanistan; vital resources which the democratic government intended to exploit in the interests of the entire nation.\n\nWomen played a key role in the new administration in Kabul. Kabul University became a hotbed of modernity. Up to fifty percent of Kabul's university students were women during the 1980s. Thousands of women enrolled in the armed forces and there were 7 women in parliament. Young female students roamed the streets of Kabul in denim flairs and t-shirts, dating men of their own choice. Some people spoke of a golden era.\n\nA Soviet stooge or Non-aligned State?\n\nIn an attempt to discredit the independence of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the new state often dismissed as a 'Soviet stooge'. But the Soviet Union had no intention of fomenting socialist revolution in Afghanistan. A high-raking Soviet official told the American sociologist Louis Depree before the Saur Revolution\n\nif there is one country in the world we would not like to try scientific socialism at this point, it is Afghanistan\n\nThe Soviet Union had itself abandoned socialism and proletarian internationalism with the Khrushchevite reforms of 1957, which restored the capitalist mode of production.\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union was quick to supply 104 million dollars in development aid to the new regime, Western development aid was significantly higher at 121 million, half of which came from the World Bank.\n\nThe Kabul regime signaled its willingness to maintain friendly relations with the United States and the US increased aid to 300 million dollars.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance claimed that there was 'no evidence of Soviet complicity in the coup'.\n\nBoth the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South-Asian Affairs Harold Saunders and Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Newsom, felt that the Afghan regime was independent from Moscow.\n\nNewsom commented:\n\nThey struck me as very ideological but they were still Afghan nationalists. My assessment was that we were dealing with a regime that hadn't found itself. There were divisions in it and it was still on probation in Soviet eyes. I felt it was justifiable to keep what assets we had and to continue a holding action, a monitoring action.\" This was also the position of the US ambassador to Afghanistan Adolph Dubs.\n\nHowever, Carter's National Security Advisor Zbigniew Bzrezinski was determined to take covert military action against the Kabul government and remove US diplomatic presence from the country.\n\nUS aid was finally cut off after a group of right-wing Islamists murdered the Adolph Dubs, the US ambassador to Afghanistan. The terrorists had kidnapped Dubs in order to blackmail the Kabul government for the imprisonment of right-wing Islamists. Dubs was killed in the ensuing shootout between the terrorists and the Afghan military.\n\nThe United States government blamed Soviet advisors to the Kabul government for failing to rescue the US ambassador.\n\nCIA intervention and Bzrezinski's arc of crisis\n\nThe prospect of a communist regime spreading all the way to the oil-rich Persian Gulf sent shock waves through the Anglo-American oil oligarchy. Anglo-American control over Afghanistan would have to be established once and for oil. The result was the Carter Doctrine of 1980, which was drafted by US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Bzrezinski.\n\nThe Carter Doctrine states:\n\nThe region which is now threatened by Soviet troops in Afghanistan is of great strategic importance: It contains more than two-thirds of the world's exportable oil. The Soviet effort to dominate Afghanistan has brought Soviet military forces to within 300 miles of the Indian Ocean and close to the Straits of Hormuz, a waterway through which most of the world's oil must flow. The Soviet Union is now attempting to consolidate a strategic position, therefore, that poses a grave threat to the free movement of Middle East oil.\n\nThis situation demands careful thought, steady nerves, and resolute action, not only for this year but for many years to come. It demands collective efforts to meet this new threat to security in the Persian Gulf and in Southwest Asia. It demands the participation of all those who rely on oil from the Middle East and who are concerned with global peace and stability. And it demands consultation and close cooperation with countries in the area which might be threatened.\n\nMeeting this challenge will take national will, diplomatic and political wisdom, economic sacrifice, and, of course, military capability. We must call on the best that is in us to preserve the security of this crucial region.\n\nLet our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Doctrine\n\nBzrezinski's plan was to create an 'arc of crisis' around the Soviet Union, drawing it into internecine conflict with Wahhabi terrorism.\n\nThe 'economic sacrifice' was to be paid by the Afghan people when the CIA supplied finance and weapons through their allies in Pakistan, China and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Afghan 'resistance' fighters against the 'soviet puppet' in Kabul were composed of illiterate peasants fighting under local lords. Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence, under the direction of the CIA, provided terrorist training to the Afghan Mujahedeen.\n\nRural lords and tribes men had opposed the pro-feminist policies of the Kabul regime. They also resented the agrarian policies of the government which redistributed land to the poor. The tribesmen's opposition to social equality was music to the ears of the US government, who would send the CIA to help them regain power.\n\nThe CIA used its contacts in Saudi Arabia to recruit a young man by the name of Bin Laden, coded named Tim Osman, to finance and co-ordinate terrorist cells in Afghanistan. Like the Vietnam War, CIA terrorism was again largely financed by narco-traficking.\n\nIt was a blunt example of Carter's 'political wisdom'. Afghan women would pay a heavy price as the US government spread fanatical Saudi-sponsored Wahhabi 'Islam' throughout the besieged Afghan state.\n\nText books with violent terrorist images were printed in Nebraska University in the United States with funding from the US government.\n\nThousands of Madrasas were set up in Pakistan to train terrorists for the US funded jihad against democratic Afghanistan.\n\nIn short violent, misogynistic 'jihadism' was a creation of US foreign policy. The much mediatized notion that Western civilization is being threatened by 'islamist fundamentalism' is a gigantic lie. Rather, Islamist Jihad in its modern form was and still is a creation of Anglo-American, Zionist intelligence agencies to serve their foreign policy objectives.\n\nReinstating the ruling tenets of British imperialism since the nineteenth century, the support for retrograde elements in Afghan society enabled the United States to destroy the secular institutions of the pro-feminist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.\n\nWestern policy makers realized that in a country of extreme poverty, Marxist ideas flourish and Marxist ideas threaten the control of the world's resources by Western oligarchs.\n\nSupporting Islamic fundamentalism provided the West with two advantages:\n\nA backward society controlled by Wahhabi clerics could easily be bribed and corrupted to serve Western interests. A backward tribal and Takfiri society would also oppose Western progress. Such a society would constitute the prefect enemy for a Western crusade to 'protect civilisation'\n\nIf such a society systemically brutalized its women, the West could use this to blackmail its client rulers in the name of 'human rights' in the pursuit of Western economic and imperial interests. In other words, Islamic fundamentalism would become a vital component of the expansion of Western imperialism.\n\nBenazir Bhutto and the rise of the Taliban\n\nThe US funded war was to take the lives of millions of Afghans and thousands of Soviet soldiers. Afghanistan's experiment in popular democracy came to a tragic end in 1992 with the fall of the Democratic government in Kabul.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan chaos reigned throughout the country. The waifs of the US-funded madrasas who had been brainwashed into the most extreme and distorted form of Islam in history, wandered the country. These madrasa students became known as the Taliban.\n\nThe rise of Benzir Bhutto in Pakistan in 1993 paved the way for the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 1996.\n\nBhutto's gender and belief in 'democracy' did not prevent her from approving financial support to the most violent misogynists in modern history.\n\nThe policy of the Clinton administration at the time was that the Taliban regime might be in US interests. We didn't read much about Taliban atrocities during the Clinton years.\n\nOn 2 November 2007 Benazir Bhutto stated to David Frost on Al Jazereera television that Bin Laden had been killed by Omar Sheikh Mohammad, whom former Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf claims was recruited by MI6 as a student in the London School of Economics to serve in the Bosnian Muslim jihad against the Yugoslav government during the 1990s.\n\nBhutto had potentially blown another myth behind NATO's Afghan adventure. She didn't live to repeat it. She was assassinated on the 27 December 2007.\n\nBourgeois feminists and pseudo-revolutionary organisations\n\nIn 1977 the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan was formed under the leadership of Meena Kewshwar Kamal.\n\nAlthough much as been made in the West of Meena Keshwar Kamal's contribution to women's rights in Afghanistan and their heroic work highlighting abuse of women since the arrival of the Taliban, RAWA was from the start, a counterrevolutionary organisation that would vociferously oppose the progressive polices of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.\n\nWhile RAWA stands for women's rights, it does not support social equality.\n\nSharing the same rabid anti-communist Weltanschaung, as US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Bzrezinski, Meena denounced the DRA from the start as a 'Soviet stooge'.\n\nMeena hoped for a comprador bourgeois parliamentary democracy where existing class structures would not be threatened.\n\nHer bourgeois version of feminism gained her generous support from the anti-communist government of Francois Mitterand in Paris. In 1981 she was invited to Paris to attend the French Socialist Party congress. She travelled Europe meeting with government officials.\n\nMeena received support from Trotskyists in France and Britain from the Ligue Communiste Revolutionaire to Ernest Mandel's United Secretariat, the International Socialist Organisation, Socialist Workers Parties as well as various anarchist organisations and publications.\n\nIn 2002 Sonali Kalhatkar interviewed the current leader of RAWA Taheena Faryal for the magazine Znet. In that interview Frayal made a number of highly dubious statements coming from someone who claims to be on the left.\n\nShe showed a decided preference for the semi-feudal regime of King Amanullah over the revolutionary government of 1979. Speaking about the radical changes instigated by the revolutionaries to liberate Afghan women, Faryal argued:\n\nYou really cannot bring all those changes overnight. For example, they wanted to give so-called liberties of having a boyfriend or dancing in a nightclub, which are not acceptable in our society. We really need to start from the very basic things, like education. The Soviets never made women realize their real potential. Then, after September 11 the U.S. realized, \"well, this is not an appropriate situation for the women of Afghanistan and this should change and we should get rid of this regime by bombing that country.\"\n\nFaryal believes that the democratic government was not interested in education, in spite of the fact that it introduced the most ambitious education programme in the country's history.\n\nSo, according to the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, Moscow's puppet 'Stalinists'were far too radical, far too liberal. Socialism, she claimed 'never made women realize their real potential' and the United States entered the war because the Taliban regime was 'not an appropriate regime for women!'\n\nWhen asked if her 'revolutionary'organisation would accept money from the US governments Faryal replied:\n\nIf they support us with our policies of being anti-fundamentalist, for democracy, for freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of belief, for human rights and women's rights and obviously we have always exposed the countries who've supported this or that fundamentalist group in Afghanistan, then I don't think that we would mind if they support us with all of our policies, but I don't think that would be possible.\n\nSo here we have a leftist revolutionary who believes that the US oligarchs might be willing to promote democracy!\n\nIn the same article this ultra-left revolutionary welcomed World Bank corporate investment once the US had helped the country to defeat the 'terrorists'.\n\nFaryal said that RAWA would accept US funding provided the organisation is not forced to change its policies. Given the fact that RAWA was formed to oppose communism, it is unlikely that the US government would be interested in changing their policies.\n\nOn the RAWA website, it is claimed that Meena was killed by the KGB. However in 2002 Zmag interview, Faryal claimed that Meena was killed by Hulbuddin Hekmatyar. She neglected to mention that Hekmatyar was on the CIA payroll! It is much more likely that Meena was killed by Hekmatyar, given his record of through acid in women's faces.\n\nhttp://www.zcommunications.org/an-interview-with-tahmeena-faryal-of-the-revolutionary-association-of-the-women-of-afghanistan-by-site-administrator\n\nZmag's endorsement of RAWA was followed by an encomium in Time Magazine in 2006 by Aryn Baker shamelessly entitled:\n\n'Meena. She fought and died for the Freedom of Afghan women' Meena, the bourgeois reactionary feminist was eventually hoist by her own petard when the CIA's favourite psychopath Hekmatyar had her killed in 1987.\n\nhttp://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/in_meena.html\n\nFew leftist organisations have questioned the rationale behind RAWA's opposition to the pro-feminist DRA. All of them have perpetuated the myth that the Soviet invasion was the cause of the conflict in the country.\n\nNone of them ever questioned RAWA's commitment to equality. None of them ever asked why she did not know about US support for the Mujahedeen psychopaths. No one ever asked why she was wined and dined by Western governments as they covertly backed Bin Laden and the Islamic fundamentalists against the progressive government in Kabul.\n\nInstead all these organizations strengthened the imperialist propaganda war for intervention in Afghanistan.The fact of the matter is that the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 was no different to the landing of the Allies in Normandy in 1944. Afghanistan was already under occupation by agents from Pakistan in the service of the CIA , who were murdering innocent civilians throughout the country.\n\nIt is true that the Soviet Union under Brezhnev was a corrupt edifice with highly dubious internationalist and democratic credentials. It was also true that the invasion played into the hands of the CIA who wanted to give the Soviet Union its own Vietnam.\n\nNevertheless, the Republic of Afghanistan brought tremendous hope to Afghanistan's illiterate poor and to oppose its defense was to oppose the defense of national liberation and democracy. Unfortunately, Socialist Albania, where women enjoyed the highest freedom of any country, and whose analysis of Soviet and Chinese social imperialism was correct, failed to understand the class relations in Afghanistan and lent its support to CIA-fomented counter-revolution.\n\nThere is a difference between invading a country to help that country drive out another invader, and invading a country to oppress its people. This is a distinction that Noam Chomsky has made in the past when justifying the allied invasion of France in 1944. But he has refused to do so with regard to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.\n\nDr. Anahita Ratebzad: forgotten revolutionary\n\nOne of the founding members of this new democratic era in Afghan politics Anahita Ratebzad; this women has virtually been erased from Afghanistan's history.\n\nAnahita Ratebzad had the privilege of a good education under in the post war period when Amanullah Shah opened the French Malalai lyc\u00e9e in Kabul for girls. Ratebzad went to train as a doctor in Kabul University before becoming a Member of Parliament along with three other women in 1965.\n\nAnahita Ratebzad went on to become minister for Education in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In one of her most famous editorials for the New Kabul Times she wrote:\n\nPrivileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country ... Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention.\n\nOne of the CIA's key agents was a narco-traficking psychopath called Hulbuddin Hekmatyar. Hetmatyar' favourite form of torture involved cutting the testicles of Russian soldiers and sticking them down their mouths. Another pastime involved throwing acid into women's faces. President Reagan called this man a 'freedom fighter'. http://www.counterpunch.org/leupp02142003.html\n\nIn 1986, Anahita Ratebzad hoped to travel to the United Kingdom for talks with the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The fact that Thatcher was a woman didn't waiver her rabid anti-communist fanaticism. Her support for the misogynist Mujahedeen was absolute.\n\nWhen the Scottish MP Ron Brown asked the British prime minister if she would see meet with Dr. Ratebzad to discuss peace proposals, this was the callous reply he received:\n\nWe do not regard the Karmal regime as a legitimate regime. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for Dr. Anahita Ratebzad, as a senior member of that regime, to visit this country. If the Karmal regime were sincere about peace it would open the way to progress in the United Nations negotiations by agreeing to the withdrawal of the 118,000 Soviet troops currently occupying Afghanistan.\n\nThere was no mention in the British prime minister's haughty response to the UK and CIA backed terrorism of the Mujahedeen against the Democratic Government of Afghanistan, nor did she care about the atrocities being carried out against Afghan women by Mullahs trained by the SAS.\n\nThe CIA's intervention in Afghanistan eventually led to the fall of the Afghan democracy in 1992. Anarchy and chaos reigned before the arrival of the Taliban in 1994. The Taliban found favour with the Clinton administration as they seemed open to US oil-pipeline plans for the country.\n\nThe story should be simple enough for the average citizen to follow. Afghanistan's women were reduced to serfs thanks to Western support for their oppressors. But telling the truth about women in Afghanistan would undoubtedly ruin the 'Homeric heroism' of our NATO battalions in 'barbarous' Afghanistan.\n\nThe CIA plan for French media pro-war propaganda\n\nOn the 11th of March 2010, Wikileaks released a classified CIA document entitled \"Afghanistan: Sustaining West European Support for the NATO-led Mission-Why Counting on Apathy Might Not Be Enough.\"\n\nThe document lays out the CIA's plan to manipulate the French and German public into supporting the NATO war in Afghanistan. The report recommends planting propaganda stories in France highlighting NATO's efforts to help Afghan women. Support for the NATO war has been waning in France due to the increase in troop casualties and the lack of progress. The CIA report states:\n\npassive French and German dislike of their troop presence could turn into active and politically potent hostility. The tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in French or German casualties or in Afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal.\n\nTo counter the danger that the French and German public might wake up to the fact that their armies are not in Afghanistan for altruistic reasons, the CIA strongly recommends\n\nmessaging that dramatizes the potential adverse consequences of an ISAF defeat for Afghan civilians could leverage French (and other European) guilt for abandoning them. The prospect of the Taliban rolling back hard-won progress on girls' education could provoke French indignation, become a rallying point for France's largely secular public, and give voters a reason to support a good and necessary cause despite casualties.\n\nThe CIA strategy to mask the horror of NATO's murderous occupation was subsequently widely bruited in France. The story of Aisha, the Afghan woman, whose nose was cut off by the Taliban, featured in France's popular magazine Paris Match and other mainstream publications. The Paris Match headline read 'Le Visage Retrouv\u00e9'- the recovered face.\n\nThe Aisha story also appeared on the Paris Match website about the report of another French soldier killed in action in Afghanistan. The story of Aisha, whose nose was replaced by American military surgeons, received generous coverage in France, and the CIA has been working assiduously in France ever since to raise awareness about the plight of Afghan women.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the timing of the CIA report, it was perhaps not incidental that the French government were at this time highly concerned about highlighting the importance of banning the burqa , and that the Al Qaeda terrorist threat had reached an all time high in France .\n\nAl Qaeda have an uncanny tendency to resurface just at that point when wars to exterminate them become unpopular. Pushing the debate on whether or not to ban the burka enables the French military industrial complex to justify its military occupation of Afghanistan on 'humanitarian' grounds.\n\nThe burka debate focuses one's mind on the fact that France opposes the oppression of women and that is why French troops must kill and die in Afghanistan.\n\nThe scale of destruction wrought on Afghanistan since the NATO occupation is rarely discussed in the European media. We are never told, for example, that groups opposed to the Taliban were also vociferously opposed to the NATO occupation.\n\nWe are never told that over 90 percent of Afghan women now suffer from depression, over eight percent of Afghan men have serious mental problems; over 30 percent of Afghan children have to work. We are never told by the mainstream press that since the invasion the plight of women has worsened considerably. More children under 5 die in NATO occupied Afghanistan than NAZI occupied Poland.\n\nThe media fails to inform us that the death toll since the NATO invasion stands at more than 5 million with war refugees estimated at 3.2 million. http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2010/10/15/afghan-war-afghan-holocaust-and-afghan-genocide-9th-anniversary-4-9-million-dead-3-2-million-refugees-report.html\n\nThe fairy tale that NATO forces have invaded Afghanistan to protect the 'Afghan people' from the cruel Taliban is rarely debunked. By creating the Taliban and Al Qaeda, western imperialists had a perfect pretext to effect a long term redivision of the world that would entail permanent genocide under the guise of permanent Western 'humanitarianism'. Henceforth, the bombing, mutilation and enslavement of women in Western occupied countries would be presented as their liberation.\n\nSince the French engagement in Afghanistan in 2001, 88French soldiers have been killed. It is in fact this relatively small number of French casualties rather than the holocaust which NATO has imposed on Afghanistan which is the cause of the French public's apathy towards the war.\n\nThe French establishment which vaunts the heroism of the French resistance against NAZI occupation during World War II does not see the irony in referring to the Afghan resistance as 'terrorists'.\n\nThe history of Western intervention in Afghanistan shows that the West has been the source of the oppression suffered by Afghan women.\n\nBy arming and indoctrinating illiterate Afghan peasants with anti-communist fanaticism during the 1980s, the West created a nightmare for the women of Afghanistan. The French government of Mitterrand colluded in this crime against humanity. Now France is again complicit in war crimes. This is why people like Anahita Ratebzad must remain unknown; this is why Afghanistan's history of women's liberation must be veiled.\n\nComment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page\n\nBecome a Member of Global Research",

                    "body": "This article was first published on April 13, 2013.\n\nWomen's rights are increasingly heralded as a useful propaganda device to further imperial designs.\n\nWestern heads of state, UN officials and military spokespersons will invariably praise the humanitarian dimension of the October 2001 US-NATO led invasion of Afghanistan, which allegedly was to fight religious fundamentalists, help little girls go to school, liberate women subjected to the yoke of the Taliban.\n\nThe logic of such a humanitarian dimension of the Afghan war is questionable. Lest we forget, Al Qaeda and the Taliban were supported from the very outset of the Soviet-Afghan war by the US, as part of a CIA led covert operation.\n\nAs described by the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA):\n\nThe US and her allies tried to legitimize their military occupation of Afghanistan under the banner of \"bringing freedom and democracy for Afghan people\". But as we have experienced in the past three decades, in regard to the fate of our people, the US government first of all considers her own political and economic interests and has empowered and equipped the most traitorous, anti-democratic, misogynist and corrupt fundamentalist gangs in Afghanistan.\n\nIt was the US which installed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 1996, a foreign policy strategy which resulted in the demise of Afghan women's rights:\n\nUnder NSDD 166, US assistance to the Islamic brigades channelled through Pakistan was not limited to bona fide military aid. Washington also supported and financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the process of religious indoctrination, largely to secure the demise of secular institutions. (Michel Chossudovsky, 9/11 ANALYSIS: From Ronald Reagan and the Soviet-Afghan War to George W Bush and September 11, 2001, Global Research, September 09, 2010)\n\nReligious schools were generously funded by the United States of America:\n\nEducation in Afghanistan in the years preceding the Soviet-Afghan war was largely secular. The US covert education destroyed secular education. The number of CIA sponsored religious schools (madrassas) increased from 2,500 in 1980 to over 39,000 [in 2001]. (Ibid.)\n\nAfghan women now. (AFP Photo / Shah Marai)\n\nAfghan women in the 1970s before the CIA-led intervention\n\nUnknown to the American public, the US spread the teachings of the Islamic jihad in textbooks \"Made in America\" developed at the University of Nebraska:\n\n... the United States spent millions of dollars to supply Afghan schoolchildren with textbooks filled with violent images and militant Islamic teachings, part of covert attempts to spur resistance to the Soviet occupation.\n\nThe primers, which were filled with talk of jihad and featured drawings of guns, bullets, soldiers and mines, have served since then as the Afghan school system's core curriculum. Even the Taliban used the American-produced books...\n\nThe White House defends the religious content, saying that Islamic principles permeate Afghan culture and that the books \"are fully in compliance with US law and policy.\" Legal experts, however, question whether the books violate a constitutional ban on using tax dollars to promote religion.\n\n... AID officials said in interviews that they left the Islamic materials intact because they feared Afghan educators would reject books lacking a strong dose of Muslim thought. The agency removed its logo and any mention of the U.S. government from the religious texts, AID spokeswoman Kathryn Stratos said.\n\n\"It's not AID's policy to support religious instruction,\" Stratos said. \"But we went ahead with this project because the primary purpose . . . is to educate children, which is predominantly a secular activity.\"\n\n... Published in the dominant Afghan languages of Dari and Pashtun, the textbooks were developed in the early 1980s under an AID grant to the University of Nebraska -Omaha and its Center for Afghanistan Studies. The agency spent $ 51 million on the university's education programs in Afghanistan from 1984 to 1994.\" (Washington Post, 23 March 2002)\n\nHistorical Flashback\n\nBefore the Taliban came to power, Afghan women lived a life in many ways similar to that of Western women (see pictures below):\n\nKabul University 1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, Kabul was \"a cosmopolitan city. Artists and hippies flocked to the capital. Women studied agriculture, engineering and business at the city's university. Afghan women held government jobs.\" There were female members of parliament, and women drove cars, and travelled and went on dates, without needing to ask a male guardian for permission.\n\nIronically, the rights of women as described by RAWA prior to the US sponsored jihadist insurgency is confirmed in a 2010 article published by Foreign Policy (2010), a Washington Post mouthpiece founded by Samuel Huntington:\n\n\"Kabul University students changing classes. Enrollment has doubled in last four years.\"\n\nThe physical campus of Kabul University, pictured here, does not look very different today. But the people do. In the 1950s and '60s, students wore Western-style clothing; young men and women interacted relatively freely. Today, women cover their heads and much of their bodies, even in Kabul. A half-century later, men and women inhabit much more separate worlds.\n\n\"Biology class, Kabul University.\"\n\nIn the 1950s and '60s, women were able to pursue professional careers in fields such as medicine. Today, schools that educate women are a target for violence, even more so than five or six years ago.\n\n\"Phonograph record store.\"\n\nSo, too, were record stores, bringing the rhythm and energy of the Western world to Kabul teenagers.\n\n\"Hundreds of Afghan youngsters take active part in Scout programs.\"\n\nAfghanistan once had Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. In the 1950s and '60s, such programs were very similar to their counterparts in the United States, with students in elementary and middle schools learning about nature trails, camping, and public safety. But scouting troops disappeared entirely after the Soviet invasions in the late 1970s. (Mohammad Qayoumi Once Upon a Time in Afghanistan..., Foreign Policy, May 27, 2010)\n\nThe acute reader will have noticed the insidious disinformation in the previous caption. We are led to believe that the liberal lifestyle of Afghan women was destroyed by the Soviet Union, when in fact it was the result of US support to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Acknowledged by US foreign policy Advisor Zbignew Brzezinski, Moscow's action in support of the Kabul pro-Soviet government was to counter the Islamist Mujahedin insurgency supported covertly by the CIA:\n\nIndeed, it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention [...]\n\nThat secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter. We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war. (The CIA's Intervention in Afghanistan, Nouvel Observateur, 1998, Global Research, October 15, 2001)\n\nIn 1982, President Ronald Reagan even dedicated the space shuttle Columbia to the US supported Islamist \"freedom fighters\" in Afghanistan, namely Al Qaeda and the Taliban:\n\nJust as Columbia we think represents man's finest aspirations in the field of science and technology, so too does the struggle of the Afghan people represent man's highest aspirations for freedom.\n\nRonald Reagan meeting with the Taliban in 1985: '\"These gentlemen (the Taliban) are the moral equivalents of America's founding fathers.\"\n\nYet, both the US and the governments of NATO members claim the US-NATO military presence in Afghanistan was instrumental in promoting women's rights. The fact of the matter is that those rights were abolished by the US-backed Taliban regime which came to power with the support of Washington.\n\nThe US State Department's Syrian Women's Network\n\nHow does the history of women in Afghanistan relate to women's rights in Syria in the context of the current crisis?\n\nThe undeclared US-NATO war on Syria (2011-2013) in support of Al Qaeda affiliated rebels appears to have a similar logic, namely the destruction of secular education and the demise of women's rights.\n\nWill Syrian women be facing the same grim future as that of Afghan women under the Taliban regime?\n\nLast January, \"a diverse group of Syrian women\" said to be \"representing the leading opposition movements\" attended a conference hosted by the Women's Democracy Network (WDN), in coordination with the U.S. Department of State's Office of Global Women's Issues in Doha, Qatar.\n\nWDN is an initiative of the International Republican Institute, well-known for supporting dissidents in various countries defying US imperialism. The US State Department is clearly using \"women's rights\" as a tool, while at the same time it is funding an Islamist \"opposition\" with a view to undermining the secular state and eventually installing an Islamist government in Damascus.\n\nThe Syrian Women's Network was formed at the US-sponsored conference and a Charter was written \"to ensure women are included in the conflict resolution and transition of their country\":\n\nIn the charter, participants call for equal rights and representation for all Syrians, demanding equal participation of women at all international meetings, negotiations, constitution drafting and reconciliation committees and in elected governing bodies. The charter also covers topics including prevention of and prosecution for acts of violence against women, access to education and the overall need for women's participation in ongoing conflict resolution while ensuring women's future participation in the rebuilding of Syria. U.S. government leaders also participated in the conference, underscoring their support of the Syrian women [...] In her remarks, Carla Koppell, senior coordinator for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment at the United States Agency for International Development [USAID], advised, \"If the most diverse group of women can find a common agenda, it will have enormous strength.\" (Women Demand Role in Syria's Transition and Reconciliation, January 28, 2013, emphasis added.)\n\nMonica McWilliams, founder of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition (left) and Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo Edita Tahiri (right) share their experiences with participants of a conference in Doha, Qatar, where Charter of the Syrian Women's Network was adopted by a diverse group of Syrian women representing the leading opposition movements in the country.(Photo from wdn.org)\n\nThe first striking paradox of this conference is that it is being held in Qatar, a country where women's rights remain limited, to say the least. In mid-March, the Qatar government even expressed concerns \"about references to women's sexual and reproductive rights\" which are contained in the UN Declaration of the Commission on the Status of Women called Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls.\n\nSecond paradox: USAID, which contributed to the demise of women's rights by promoting religious indoctrination in Afghanistan, is now promoting women's rights to bring about regime change in Syria. In the meantime, the US along with Qatar and Saudi Arabia is supporting Islamist extremist groups fighting against the secular Syrian government. Some so-called \"liberated areas\" in Syria are now run by religious extremists:\n\n\"Religious Wahhabi school and women's rights in a 'liberated' area of Aleppo run by the US-Saudi backed 'opposition', 'a definite improvement' when compared to the prevailing system of secular education in Syria.\" (Michel Chossudovsky, Syria: Women's Rights and Islamist Education in a \"Liberated\" Area of Aleppo, Global Research, March 27, 2013.)\n\nWere a US proxy regime to be installed in Damascus, the rights and liberties of Syrian women might well be following the same \"freedom-threatening path\" as that of Afghan women under the US-backed Taliban regime and continuing under the US-NATO occupation.\n\nJulie L\u00e9vesque is a journalist and researcher with the Centre for Research on Globalization (CRG), Montreal.

                    "body": "by Haleem, Omid\n\nKABUL, March 9 (Bernama) -- Although women's status has improved to some extent, there is still a long way ahead to ensure their rights and eliminate violence against women in conservative Afghan society, a women's right activist Mursal, 24, told China's Xinhua news agency on Tuesday.\n\nLiving in the capital city Kabul and fighting for women's rights, Mursal, who like many Afghans goes by one name, said that Afghan women are still facing pervasive violence ranging from physical beatings to murders, even though the country's constitution guarantees women's rights.\n\n\"I can say that Afghanistan is hell for women; is the most dangerous country for women to live in as several women have been stoned to death or brutally killed over the past year,\" the activist lamented in talks with Xinhua.\n\nTo prove her claim, the young activist noted that a female Kabul resident, Farkhunda, 28, was brutally killed and her body set on fire by a mob in Kabul city in broad daylight last March, while several more women and girls have been stoned to death or beheaded in areas controlled by Taliban militants.\n\nAlthough women's status has positively improved in Afghanistan since the dethroning of the Taliban regime in late 2001, Afghan women, mostly in the countryside, are facing variety of problems and violence.\n\nPhysical beating by in-laws' families, domestic violence including under-aged marriage and forced marriage of women and girls are common occurrences in the male-dominated and conservative Afghan society, where tribal traditions are deep rooted.\n\nAccording to the Afghan human rights commission, 5,132 cases of violence against women including murders, honour killings, rapes, and physical and mental violence, have been registered over the past one year.\n\nThe statistics, released on the eve of March 8, which is International Women's Day, revealed that cases of violence against women registered in the previous year totalled 4,873, which shows a shocking increase in the past year.\n\n\"Women are regarded as second class citizens in Afghanistan,\" Mursal said, saying, \"Women cannot leave their homes alone, or they will face violence, even on the streets.\"\n\nInternational Women's Day, in Afghanistan was marked by holding meetings, conferences and seminars in the capital city and in the provinces to highlight women's rights and their role in developing society.\n\nTo boost awareness on women's rights and their role in developing the country, the state-owned media including national radio and television aired special programmes related to the topic.\n\n\"I am committed to ignoring all challenges and security threats to fight for the rights of women and even sacrifice my own life to win the war for my rights and the rights of all women,\" said Mursal bravely.\n\nDefying the tribal tradition and restrictions imposed by its regime during its six-year reign, Afghan women, presently, are serving as cabinet members, legislators, business people, artists and singers, a progress unthinkable during the Taliban rule.\n\nHowever, women and girls in the countryside and rural areas are unaware of their rights, and are mostly confined to their houses where they suffer from poverty and have little access to school and clinics.\n\n\"Afghan women have seen positive changes in their status over the past 15 years in the post-Taliban Afghanistan. Women in cities can go to school, can work in offices and have their own businesses,\" another women's rights activist, Hamida Wardak, told Xinhua.\n\nNevertheless, she said that women in the male-dominated Afghan society are still deprived of their rights, especially in the rural areas.\n\n\"In many cases, particularly in rural areas, the tribal traditions and security problems have deprived women and girls from going to school and working out of home,\" Wardak said regrettably, adding that achieving women's rights would require a sustained fight.\n\n-- BERNAMA",

Women in cities can go to school, can work in offices and have their own businesses,\" another women's rights activist, Hamida Wardak, told Xinhua.\n\nNevertheless, she said that women in the male-dominated Afghan society are still deprived of their rights, especially in the rural areas.\n\n\"In many cases, particularly in rural areas, the tribal traditions and security problems have deprived women and girls from going to school and working out of home,\" Wardak said regrettably, adding that achieving women's rights would require a sustained fight.\n\nRelated:\n\nAfghan forces recapture district, cleanup operation continues: police\n\nPUL-E-KHUMRI, Afghanistan, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Afghan security forces, following fierce fighting, recaptured Dand-e-Shahabudin district outside Baghlan provincial capital Pul-e-Khumri on Tuesday.\n\nZabihullah Sheja, police spokesman in the province, said the security forces have been chasing militants to ensure lasting peace in the region, 160 km north of Kabul. Full story\n\nAfghan battle claims 32 lives including 19 militants\n\nKABUL, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Afghan militancy and counter-militancy have claimed the lives of 32 people including 19 armed insurgents and 13 security personnel across the conflict-ridden country over the past 24 hours, officials confirmed Monday.\n\nUp to 14 Taliban militants have been killed as clash erupted in Kajaki district of the southern Helmand province on Monday, an army spokesman in the restive province, Mohammad Rasoul Zazai said. Full story\n\n549 army officers graduate from Afghan national defense university\n\nKABUL, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 549 army officers graduated from an Afghan national defense university and were commissioned to the country's national army on Monday.\n\n\"We witness another historic day, I congratulate your success and victory, and that all Afghans will be proud of you, they will be proud of your determination,\" Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani said at a graduation ceremony held here.

                    "body": "The Afghan women continue to be confronted by enormous challenges despite important achievements and significant progress Afghanistan has seen in the last decade in the promotion of gender equality.\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) noted the progress mainly in constitutional guarantees on non-discrimination, the enactment of the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) law criminalizing harmful traditional practices, and, most recently, the adoption of the National Action Plan on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) committing to promote women in leadership and their meaningful participation in conflict-prevention, peace negotiations and post-conflict processes.\n\nThe UN mission in Afghanistan issued a statement on the eve of International Women's Day, under the global theme of Planet 50-50 by 2030: Step It Up for Gender Equality.\n\nUNAMA said it also recognizes the increased representation of Afghan women in the workplace - including within Afghan Ministries, Parliament and civil society - and Afghan women's significant contribution to the economic and social development of the country.\n\nHowever, UN mission said Afghan women continue to be confronted by enormous challenges that exclude them from political processes vital for peace and security. Additionally, the escalation in conflict continues to take a heavy toll on Afghan civilians, and Afghan women in particular, with a 37 per cent increase in women casualties in 2015 compared to 2014.\n\nAccording to UNAMA, the continued prevalence of violence against women and harmful practices stemming from pervasive discrimination continues to be of serious concern. In 2015, the UN observed increased incidents of targeting, threats and intimidation of women in public life across the country, particularly those outspoken activists promoting women's rights.\n\n\"Moreover, women's representation in leadership roles, while advancing over years past, remains inadequate, often only symbolic and limited to the provincial capitals. Echoing the refrain of this year's Women's Day theme, the UN in Afghanistan calls for much more to be done to reverse inequality and translate commitment into real opportunities for Afghan women,\" the statement by UNAMA added.\n\nElzira Sagynbaeva, UN Women's Afghanistan Country Representative, said \"Sustaining the gains made and promoting women's rights are a must for Afghanistan to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and, more specifically, to make the goal of 50-50 by 2030 a reality.\"\n\nMs. Sagynbaeva further added that the deteriorating security situation and a corresponding fragile post-transition Afghanistan have led to a growing concern about the future of Afghan women and how to ensure that the hard-won struggles of the women of Afghanistan are not compromised or lost.\n\n\"Substantial participation of women in the forthcoming parliamentary and district elections is critical to the credibility and inclusiveness of the process,\" she said, stressing that the Afghan Government must ensure women's rights and their meaningful participation in any peace talks.\n\n\"Women must be able to participate actively in all political, social and development initiatives across the country, including in any peace processes,\" said Nicholas Haysom, the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan.\n\nThe UN envoy, who is also head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).said the world body remains committed to advancing women's meaningful participation in building sustainable peace and security.\n\nMr. Haysom added that Afghan men and boys have an important role to play in helping to empower women and achieve gender equality in the home, the community and the workplace.\n\n\"The United Nations celebrates the achievements made by Afghan women and calls for additional action to address the gaps that still remain in making gender equality a reality for Afghan women and girls,\" he said.",
