                    "body": "This iPhone 15 Pro Max design render is UNLIKE anything you have seen before\n\nThose looking to purchase the iPhone 15 are in for a disappointment as it is set to miss out on two of the best features present in the iPhone 14 Pro, according to reports. Although the iPhone 15 series is nearly 7 months away from launch, leaks and rumours about Apple's next flagship iPhone series have flooded the market. Various tipsters have reported that the Pro variants of the iPhone 15 series are set to get a major overhaul, while Apple will compromise with certain features for the standard models.\n\nAccording to a recent report by MacRumors, news aggregator account \"yeux1122\" has revealed on the Korean Naver blog that the iPhone 15 standard models could miss out on the LTPO display. As a result, features like the ProMotion display could be absent from the upcoming flagships. The lack of an updated LTPO display also means that the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Plus might miss out on the always-on display feature too.\n\nThe always-on display feature debuted with the iPhone 14 Pro models and it is the LTPO panel which enables the always-on display with the Variable Refresh Rate reducing to 1Hz. It was always expected that Apple might reserve some features for the iPhone 15 Pro models but the lack of an always-on display feature might be a turn off for some buyers, especially when it is a feature that has been present on Android smartphones since the Samsung Galaxy S7 series.\n\nThe Pro models of the iPhone 15 series are expected to have the brand new A17 Bionic chipset which could be based on the new 3nm process technology. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will get the A17 Bionic, claiming the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will stick with the A16 chip.\n\nMoreover, the iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to have a titanium frame rather than a stainless steel one, along with solid state power and volume buttons.",

                    "body": "Kuo's most recent tweet was good news for anyone hoping to purchase a cheap iPhone.\n\nContrary to earlier rumors that the next-generation iPhone SE 4 was being scrapped, Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo recently stated that the development of the smartphone is well underway. Its development was previously said to have been suspended by Kuo after the previous year. But, Kuo's most recent tweet was good news for anyone hoping to purchase an iPhone cheap because the iPhone SE 4 is now being developed and is anticipated to release in 2024 with some fantastic features.\n\nSEE ALSO: iOS 16.4 Beta Is Out Now! 5G Standalone, Security, Emojis, And More\n\nSamsung and LG typically provide OLED panels for iPhones, but both firms may find it difficult to compete with the iPhone 15 series when it launches later this year. The low-end iPhone SE4, which is anticipated to be introduced next year, is slated to have an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display of 6.1 inches, according to a report by The Elec.\n\nAlthough the iPhone SE series has only ever been offered with a liquid crystal display (LCD), the model expected for the following year will probably include an OLED. (translated) The iPhone SE 4 is said to include a 6.1-inch LCD-to-OLED display update that will result in bold colors and darker blacks.\n\nSEE ALSO: Google I/O 2023: Pixel 7a, Bard AI, Android 14, And Many More Announcements On May 10th\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 would seem slightly different from the iPhone 14 in terms of appearance. The iPhone SE would undergo its first significant design change in two generations with this modification. Early in 2022, Apple released the iPhone SE 3, which was substantially the same as the iPhone SE 2nd Gen but with a newer A15 Bionic CPU and a somewhat bigger battery. Also, according to Kuo, the iPhone SE 4 will use a 5G modem built on an Apple-designed 4-nanometer production node rather than Qualcomm's modem chips.",

                    "body": "Flipkart has kicked off the Big Savings Day sale where there is an extravaganza of offers on smartphones. If you are looking to buy an iPhone especially, Flipkart has a deal that is hard to miss. The iPhone 14 price has dropped below Rs 70,000 for the first time. Over and above the big discount, you have the option to shave money off the price by making payments through credit cards. Also Read - iPhone 13 was the best selling smartphone globally in 2022: Report\n\nBefore I tell you about the offer on the iPhone 14 on Flipkart, a few things to keep in mind. The discounted price is applicable to the colour variants that were launched last year, namely, Midnight, Blue, Starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED. The latest Yellow variant of the iPhone 14 is not up for sale right now. The pre-ordering of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in Yellow will go live later today. The sale of the Yellow iPhone 14 will begin on March 14 at a starting price of Rs 79,900. Also Read - Apple Announces New Yellow Colour Variant For iPhone 14 And 14 Plus - Watch Video\n\nApple iPhone 14 Flipkart offer\n\nInstead of the original price of Rs 79,900, the iPhone 14 is currently selling for the price of Rs 65,999 on Flipkart. That means a discount of Rs 13,901. Now, if you use an ICICI Bank credit card, you can get a discount of Rs 1,000, bringing down the price to Rs 64,999. Over and above these discounts, you have the option to trade in your old, used smartphone to save more money. For instance, if you have an iPhone XR to exchange, you can get about Rs 10,000 off on the purchase. The effective price, then, becomes Rs 54,999 -- which is the best deal you can get on the iPhone 14 right now. Also Read - Apple may make India a separate sales region as iPhone demand grows\n\nOther than the iPhone 14, the iPhone 14 Plus is also selling at a discounted price on Flipkart. The 128GB version of the iPhone 14 Plus is currently available at Rs 73,999, as opposed to the original price of Rs 89,900. That is a discount of nearly Rs 16,000.

                    "body": "By Sneha Saha: Flipkart will be hosting Big Saving Days sale starting tomorrow, March 11. The sale will continue until March 15 on the platform. During the sale, the e-commerce platform will offer big discounts on consumer electronics, including smartphones. The teaser suggests that the latest iPhone models will also be up for grabs at a discount.\n\nThe Flipkart Big Saving Days sale teaser reveals that the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus will be available at a discounted price. While the platform hasn't revealed the exact discounted price yet, the teaser shows that the iPhone 14 will be available for under Rs 70,000. In addition, there will also be a bank offer that will further cut the price of the phone. Similarly, the iPhone 14 Plus will also be available at lowest-ever price since its launch.\n\nCurrently, the iPhone 14 starts at Rs 79,900 in India. This price is for the base model with 128GB of internal storage. The 256GB storage and 512GB storage models are priced at Rs 89,900 and Rs 1,09,900, respectively. Coming to the iPhone 14 Plus, the phone starts at a price of Rs 89,900 for the 128GB storage model. The 256GB and 512GB storage models are priced at Rs 99,900 and Rs 1,19,900, respectively.\n\nNow, if you wish to upgrade your old iPhone, which between the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus should you buy?\n\nIf you want a bigger iPhone, then the iPhone 14 Plus makes more sense. But then, if you like compact phones, the iPhone 14 is the one for you. As far as the specifications are concerned both the phones offer several design and almost the same set of specifications. The iPhone 14 offers a 6.1-inch liquid retina display, A15 Bionic chipset, up to 512GB storage, a dual rear camera system and the latest iOS software.\n\nNow you would think, since iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 offer similar set of specifications and design, which among the two should you opt for. Well, the iPhone 13, in my opinion, is now an old phone, which also means it won't be updated as much as the iPhone 14 in terms of software. So, getting the iPhone 14 makes more sense right now. Meanwhile, Apple is working on its next-generation flagship device, possibly dubbed the iPhone 15, and will unveil it later this year. As far as rumours and leaks are concerned, the iPhone 15 will be much upgraded when compared to the iPhone 14, in terms of design as well as specifications. Apple still hasn't revealed anything about the iPhone 15 yet.",

                    "title": "Should you buy iPhone 14 Pro now or wait for iPhone 15 Pro?",
                    "body": "If your current iPhone is starting to show its age, you're probably wondering whether it makes sense to buy an iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max now or wait for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max this fall.\n\nAs you'll see in our iPhone 14 Pro review and iPhone 14 Pro Max review, there are plenty of reasons to take the plunge now. With their strong cameras, fast performance and excellent battery life, it's easy to see why these flagships earned spots on our best phones list.\n\nOn the other hand, the rumors and leaks point to some pretty compelling upgrades for the iPhone 15 Pro series, as you can see in our iPhone 15 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro comparison. Rumored improvements for the fall models include the chip, telephoto zoom camera and design. Based on what we've heard so far, here's my advice on whether to buy now or wait.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max both deliver excellent cameras. In fact, they topped our best camera phone list until the Galaxy S23 Ultra and its massive 200MP sensor came along.\n\nWith the current iPhone Pro models, you get a stellar 48MP main sensor that can deliver stunning detail, especially when you engage the ProRAW setting in the camera. Check our the results from my iPhone 14 Pro 48MP ProRAW camera test and you'll get a very good sense of what's possible, enabling you to crop in pretty far without losing much detail.\n\nThe image above is just one example, with a winged basket atop a building with a baby inside. The ProRAW image is super sharp, and that's before any editing. Even if you shoot in 12MP mode you'll see bright and vivid images.\n\nOther iPhone 14 Pro highlights include a 12MP ultrawide camera that's nearly twice the size and a 12MP TrueDepth camera that now offers autofocus, plus better low-light images across the board via Apple's Photonic Engine.\n\nThe A16 Bionic chip that powers the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max delivers the fastest performance in a phone, beating even the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2-powered Galaxy S23 Plus and S23 Ultra on key tests like Geekbench and our own video transcoding test.\n\nYou'll also be hard pressed to find a game that doesn't play smoothly on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, from Call of Duty Mobile to racing games like Asphalt 9.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max have among the brightest and most colorful displays you'll find on any flagship. We're talking nearly 1,300 of peak brightness when display HDR content and a strong 83.2% of the DCI-P3 color space. And the accuracy is great as well.\n\nThere are two key innovations with the iPhone 14 Pro series' displays that I really appreciate. One is the always-on display, which lets you review the time, battery status and weather at a glance, as well as notifications if you want them.\n\nThe other is Dynamic Island, which delivers alerts and live activities at the top of the display around the notch. With this feature you can see incoming calls at a glance, as well as check sports scores and the ETA of your Uber without diving into an app.\n\nWe tested the battery life of all four iPhone 14 models, which involves continuous web surfing over 5G at 150 nits of screen brightness. And the iPhone 14 Pro Max offered a stellar runtime of 13 hours and 39 minutes. That's strong enough to make our best phone battery life list. (Anything above 11.5 hours is really good.)\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro endured for 10 hours and 13 minutes, which is decent but that's what happens when you have a smaller 3,200 mAh battery inside a smaller 6.1-inch phone. The iPhone 14 Pro Max's 6.7-inch size has room for a larger 4,323 mAh pack.\n\nYup, this upgrade is long overdue, but if you've been waiting for a more powerful zoom from Apple to rival what Samsung phones feature, this could be the year. The iPhone 15 Pro will reportedly boast a periscope zoom lens with 6x optical zoom, a big upgrade from the weaker 3x telephoto camera on the iPhone 14 Pro series.\n\nSo what about digital zoom? We bet it will be a lot better than the current 15x for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. While we don't have any details yet, I would bet Apple goes for at least 30x to match the Google Pixel 7 Pro, even if it doesn't reach the crazy high 100x Space Zoom on the Galaxy S23 Ultra.\n\nIt's been widely reported that Apple is finally ditching its Lightning port for USB-C, and it's easy to see why. The EU is mandating that Apple embrace USB-C by the end of 2024. And Apple has said that it will bring USB-C to the iPhone, even though it didn't provide timing.\n\nSo the hope is that Apple will offer faster charging on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. We've also heard that the iPhone 15 Pro series may get faster transfer, but that rumor is by no means confirmed.\n\nYou'll have to forgive the technical mumbo jumbo, but this is pretty key for the iPhone 15 series. The rumored A17 Bionic chip for the iPhone 15 Pro is tipped to be the world's first based on the 3nm process. This should mean more transistors packed in and therefore better performance than the 4nm A16 Bionic.\n\nIt gets better. The new 3nm A17 Bionic chip is reportedly 35% more power efficient compared to the A16 Bionic. So both the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max should last longer on a charge.\n\nWhile I like the design of the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, the sharp edges can dig into your hand when holding it. Fortunately, it looks like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max could be getting more rounded edges, which means a comfier design for you.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max could also feature a titanium alloy body. Titanium is even tougher than aluminum while weighing less. So it's possible that both iPhone 15 Pro models will be lighter and stronger.\n\nAs someone who owns an iPhone 12 Pro Max, I'm personally torn around the question of whether you should buy an iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max now versus waiting for the iPhone 15 Pro series.\n\nI really like the cameras, display and performance offered by the iPhone 14 Pro -- and I appreciate the always-on display more than I thought I would. But I've also been waiting for a more powerful zoom, as the Galaxy S23 Ultra has made me a bit jealous.\n\nIf your phone is 3 years old or older, I think the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max will more than satisfy if you upgrade now. But if you're on the fence, it could pay to wait a few more months for the iPhone 15 Pros.",

                    "body": "Apple iPhone 14 is available at lowest-price ever in the Flipkart Big Saving Days Sale that begins today (March 10) for Flipkart Plus subscribers. Apple iPhone 14 was launched last year at a starting price of 79,900 but in the Flipkart Big Saving Days Sale, it is available at just Rs 44,249 after Rs 35,651 discount. Apple iPhone 14 is currently retailing at Rs 64,999 on Flipkart after Rs 14,901 off. In addition to this, buyers are eligible to get 10% off on ICICI Bank credit and debit card transactions, up to Rs 750, on orders of Rs 5,000 and above. Apart from this, Flipkart is offering up to Rs 20,000 off in exchange for your old smartphone. This means after all bank offers and discounts, Apple iPhone 14 is available at Rs 44,249 on Flipkart after a Rs 35,901 discount.\n\nThe Apple iPhone 14 is the standard model in the flagship Apple iPhone 14 series that also consists of Apple iPhone 14 Plus, Apple iPhone 14 Pro and Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. Launched late last year, the Apple iPhone 14 failed to get a good response from the buyers during initial sales however, the smartphone picked up well in the recent Flipkart sales.\n\nThe Apple iPhone 14 failed to create the buzz that Apple expected from it as the device looks identical to its predecessor Apple iPhone 13. Both the iPhones have almost similar specifications as well. The Apple iPhone 14 is powered by the similar chipset as the Apple iPhone 13 but with more cores. It features a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display at the front with iPhone 13-like notch that houses a 12MP camera for video calls and selfies. At the rear, the phone features a dual camera setup with 12MP sensors.",

                    "body": "This article may contain personal views and opinion from the author. Regardless of how you feel about Apple there is one thing that cannot be denied - the Cupertino company knows how to sell expensive devices. After all, we are talking about the tech giant that normalized the $1000+ smartphone and largely paved the way for the massive increase in average smartphone prices over the last couple of years.\n\nI would like to assert that, strictly speaking, I have no issue with that fact. So long as users are willing to splurge on the latest and greatest iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple and its products will continue to thrive. Supply dictates demand, and the latter seems to be extremely high when it comes to the company's ultra-premium devices.\n\nNevertheless, regardless of how successful Apple's current business model is, there is one particular aspect that simply does not sit well with me. Namely, the utter lack of any meaningful entry-level options. By this I mean that most 'budget' (or, in this case, less expensive) Apple products have at least one very obvious and intentional flaw that disproportionately hinders the user experience in some way.\n\nIn the following paragraphs I will explain why this is not an ideal scenario in my view and why I, as a consumer, have a problem with how Apple currently approaches its entry-level and midrange products.\n\nFirstly, I will try to address the most common argument I hear when I try to voice my problem with the current strategy. Essentially, I am always told that Apple does not want to make good budget products because it prefers to sell only its flagship ones. I cannot agree with that sentiment.\n\nThe smartphone market is not limited to the $1000+ segment and there is money to be made outside of it. Additionally, given how good high-end Apple products are, I simply do not see a reason for this approach. You don't need to make entry-level devices bad, in order for the premium ones to sell well. Why not make the cheaper ones good, and the expensive ones better?\n\nIt should be noted that from an economic point of view, demand for the iPhone is often characterized as inelastic, because of brand loyalty. Thus, increases in the price of the top-of-the-line models are unlikely to dissuade Apple enthusiasts from buying them. Conversely, I don't see a reason why boosting the competitiveness of the lower-end models would have a negative effect on the sales of the high-end ones.\n\nEven if the latter decrease slightly, the added market share that a lower price tag can translate to will offset at least some of the potential loss of profits. That is, of course, based on my limited understanding of economics and Apple.\n\nI am not a CFO and I do not aspire to be one. Nevertheless, I still see companies like Volkswagen selling cheaper cars, without worrying that affluent consumers might prefer them over the luxury vehicles in their portfolios. Furthermore, it is precisely a diverse and balanced portfolio that makes a company such as Volkswagen command an impressive market share.\n\nAnd Apple needs a huge market share in order to continue to dominate. One of the main selling points of the Cupertino company's products is the ecosystem, the clout of which is directly proportional to the number of users it encompasses. Put simply, the more people use FaceTime, the bigger of a selling point it becomes.\n\nIn short, there is at least some economic rationale for boosting the competitiveness of entry-level products, especially when they are not all that cheap to begin with. But that should not be the only reason why Apple diversifies its product portfolio.\n\nIn the last section I focused on what Apple stands to gain from (or rather, what it will not lose as a result of) implementing meaningful entry-level options. In this part, I will look at the other side of the equation - the user.\n\nCurrently, Apple has only 3 smartphones below the $700 mark: The iPhone 13, the iPhone 13 mini and the iPhone SE 3 (2022). Out of all of them, I believe only the mini serves a specific purpose and makes sense. It is a compact smartphone that offers incredible performance and no handset on the market comes close to what it brings to the table.\n\nHowever, the iPhone 13 on the other hand is, at least for me, a true conundrum. It is, in essence, a cheaper iPhone 14. Additionally, despite having a price tag of $700, it comes with a 60Hz display. In 2021, the lack of ProMotion made sense as it ensured the proper differentiation between the iPhone 13 and the iPhone 13 Pro. Now, however, this is borderline laughable.\n\nApple is limiting ProMotion to the high-end iPhones purely for the sake of differentiation, a move it will reportedly continue to employ in 2024 with the iPhone 15 lineup. Unfortunately, I simply cannot justify paying $800+ for a smartphone in 2024 that comes with a 60Hz display. I also do not think you need to spend $1000+ in order to gain access to that feature.\n\nApple has no 'cheap' products, therefore, it does not make sense for the less expensive (by Apple standards) ones to lack something that is virtually omnipresent on the market as a whole at that price point. At best, it feels like a rip off. At worst, it is predatory pricing. But the iPhone is not the only culprit.\n\nI have always believed that Apple, unlike most other tech giants, has 3 types of products: premium, more premium and the most premium. And it is interesting to see how Apple decides how premium a device must be in order to qualify for a 'Pro' feature.\n\nFor example, ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) is regarded as a 'Pro' feature. This is why the AirPods 3 do not have it - only the AirPods Pro 2 and the AirPods Max do. This is also the reason why the first generation AirPods Pro had to be discontinued - a price cut would have put the 'Pro' feature in the non-Pro price point.\n\nHowever, the fact that the AirPods 3 are 'more premium', but not 'the most premium' in Apple's lineup, does not change the fact that they still cost $169. They remain premium by market standards and should, in my view, qualify for a 'Pro' feature regardless of the more expensive headphones Apple sells.\n\nThis naturally begs the question of how proper differentiation can be maintained. In my view, the answer is simple and Apple knows it - performance. Just take a look at the company's MacBook lineup. The MacBook Air (2022) might be an entry-level option but it does not have an obvious flaw that is there purely in order to make consumers upgrade to a more expensive option.\n\nConsumers splurge only (or mostly, at least) when they need the increase in performance. This is why I am not opposed to the vanilla iPhones using a year-old chip or having an inferior camera module. However, selectively limiting 'Pro' features on high-end devices, just because you offer a more premium option is not something I am willing to support.\n\nGiven that there are plenty of smartphones that come with 60Hz+ refresh rates that cost less than the iPhone SE, I am more inclined to consider a 120Hz display the norm, and not the 'Pro' exception.\n\nFinally, all of my arguments stem from the fact that Apple simply does not sell cheap products. If the iPhone SE 3 did not cost as much as an Android midranger, I might be able to stomach the decade-old design. Apple products are premium by default which entails a bare minimum of sorts, beyond the logo on the back.\n\nMaking your entry-level iPad (2022) compatible with your 4-year-old proprietary stylus is not equal to giving it a 'Pro' feature. There is a difference between luxury and necessity, and Apple should not charge customers extra for the latter.",

                    "body": "Some users may be having an issue with their iPhone where it gives a prompt stating to confirm iPhone passcode to continue using iCloud. Concerning this issue, there seems to be a flurry or reports regarding what the exact source of this issue may be. For those experiencing this issue, pay close attention to this article. If you recently installed a Configuration Profile to your iPhone, this could potentially be an issue.\n\nWhile iOS 16 brings a wealth of new features, some users may be having problems with their iPhone continuing to ask for their device passcode to continue using iCloud. Personally, I have not experienced this problem (yet), but the issue is making waves on the internet. Fortunately, there is a couple of solutions users can try. However, be warned that if you recently installed a Configuration Profile on your device, it may be an issue that you may want to talk about with Apple.\n\nIf you're experiencing this issue, you are likely getting a message that says:\n\nConfirm your iPhone passcode to keep using iCloud. You recently changed the passcode you use to unlock this iPhone. This passcode also protects access to data stored in iCloud.\n\nConfusingly, users are getting this message even if they have not changed their iPhone passcode in quite sometime.\n\nConsidering this can be incredibly aggravating, let's take a look at some potential solutions. While it may not be an issue with changing the passcode on your iPhone, it may be an issue with a recent change to your Apple ID password. Some are reporting this problem triggers with additional changes as well. Let's take a look.\n\nIf you want to try changing your Apple ID password, go to Settings > Apple ID > Password & Security > Change Passcode. You will need your your iPhone passcode to change your Apple ID password.\n\nTo relieve some stress, yes. More than likely this is a legitimate prompt. However, for those that mess with Configuration Profiles, they may want to ensure that it is actually legit. If you are the type that likes to install betas, this may be more of a pressing issue. However, if you are the type that uses their iPhone regularly, without installing Configuration Profiles, it is more than likely just an annoying bug.\n\nEssentially, if you have no idea what I'm talking about when I say Configuration Profile, you're more than likely dealing with a pesky bug rather than a serious issue. With that in mind, let's take a look at some solutions to this problem.\n\nOne of the most important things is that there are also rumors circulating that this is a scam message if users installed a suspicious iPhone profile. While unlikely, it may potentially be a serious issue if you do not get your Configuration Profiles from proper sources. There are reports that users are only getting this message if they installed an iPhone profile that didn't arrive from an official Apple source. Of course, this may also be a reason why Apple made changes to profiles in iOS 16.4.\n\nIf you're running a beta version of iOS, this may be causing the issue. While users should always ensure that they are getting their beta profiles directly from Apple, this isn't always the case. If you have a certain Configuration Profile on your device, here's how to remove it.\n\nEven if you don't think you recent installed a configuration profile, it may be a good idea to check to see if one is there.\n\nIf you did install a phony beta profile and are receiving this message, users are being told to not input their code into this prompt. You will need to uninstall the profile, and it may be a good idea to get in touch with Apple Support for further advice and protection. Again, while it most likely a bug, it's better to keep yourself protected.\n\nIf you checked and don't have a configuration profile installed, you may luckily have an easier issue at hand. When it comes to one of the easiest solutions, a user may just need to check their Payment Info. According to some reports, an expired card may be causing the Confirm iPhone Password request. Removing old cards or updating your payment information may solve this issue.\n\nAnother easier solution is simply changing your iPhone Passcode. Again, this is relatively straight forward.\n\nSome users are also reporting that they may be seeing this prompt due to Advanced Data Protection being enabled. You can read more about Advanced Data Protection thanks to our very own Jeff Butts.\n\nWhile this may be incredibly frustrating for users, hopefully it is a simple fix rather than accidentally installing a fraudulent iPhone profile. If you recently did install a profile onto your device, you may want to immediately remove it. As suggested, getting ahold of Apple Support for further advice and protection is probably the smart way to go.\n\nIf you did not recently install an iPhone profile, hopefully following the easier suggestions helps you with your situation. When it comes to trying out new betas, make sure that you are getting them solely from an official Apple source. While Cupertino is generally super protective of your information and privacy, all of this goes out the window once a hacker is able to get direct access to your device. Remember to stay vigilant on the internet, especially when it comes to security and protecting your devices.",

                    "body": "You've probably heard the news by now. Earlier this week, Apple released a new yellow color for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. Does it look good? I sure think so! It's a bright, vibrant, and saturated yellow that adds a lot of pop to a mostly muted color palette for the iPhone 14 series.\n\nContents Dark greenGrayMintOrangePurple\n\nBut as much as I like how the yellow looks, it's not the only color I'd love to see the iPhone come in. There are so many possibilities for future iPhone colors, and if Apple's looking for a few tips on what to do next, I have some suggestions. Here are five other colors the iPhone 14 should come in next.\n\nDark green\n\nWhile we don't have a green iPhone 14, Apple was a big fan of the color last year with the iPhone 13 family. In March 2022, the company released two green shades for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro -- including a standard green for the former and a more muted alpine green for the latter.\n\nRelated A new Android 14 update is here -- but you still shouldn't download it How the iPhone became the most boring phone you can buy in 2023 The iPhone 14 now comes in this yellow color, and I'm obsessed with it\n\nA dark green iPhone 14 wouldn't look all that different from the green iPhone 13, so I get why Apple didn't go this route. But considering how damn good the green iPhone 13 looked, I wish it had! Apple could have concocted a more saturated green to differentiate the two models just enough while still delivering a green iPhone hue that looks fantastic.\n\nGray\n\nI can hear you right now. \"Of all the colors you could wish for, you chose gray?\" It's a dull-sounding color, I know, but I think it would make for a solid addition to the iPhone 14 color lineup. Black is great for people who want an ultra-stealthy look, while white is a starker, brighter option.\n\nBut what if you want something in between? A matte gray iPhone 14 would fit the bill perfectly. It'd also look excellent paired with a Space Gray M2 MacBook Pro. Call it boring if you want, but I'd be happy to see a gray iPhone 14 join the ranks.\n\nMint\n\nGoing back to something more visually interesting -- can you imagine a mint iPhone 14? It could be a sort of callback to the green color Apple used for the iPhone 11 in 2019, which had a very light, minty hue to it. Now that it's been a few years, it would have been a perfect time to bring it back.\n\nI find that there's something just so calming about a good mint color. It looks refreshing and peaceful, and isn't something we see very often in the smartphone design world. Apple created a great mint color once before, and with the iPhone 14, I wish we had seen it again.\n\nOrange\n\nIn all the years it's been making iPhones, Apple has never released an orange model. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, but I think it's high time Apple changes that. The iPhone 13 was rumored to come in orange, as was the iPhone 14 Pro. But time and time again, it never happens.\n\nAs my quick mock-up shows, an orange iPhone 14 would have looked incredible. It's not as intense as (Product) Red and it's a darker hue than yellow. I think the right approach here would be a bright, saturated orange rather than something dark and muted. We ultimately didn't get that with the iPhone 14, but I certainly wish we had.\n\nPurple\n\nLast but certainly not least, how good would a purple iPhone 14 have looked? The iPhone 14 Pro already comes in the lovely deep purple color, so pairing the iPhone 14 with a similar (but different) purple color of its own would have added some great symmetry between the two models.\n\nIf Apple had gone the purple route, it would have been great to see a punchier, more saturated purple color. The deep purple iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are very dark and subdued -- almost appearing gray in certain lighting conditions. A more intense purple for the iPhone 14 would have been immensely cool to see.\n\nEditors' Recommendations The 5 biggest announcements we expect from Google I/O 2023 Your Google One plan just got 2 big security updates to keep you safe online Android does this one thing so much better than iOS, and it drives me crazy iPhone 15: release date and price predictions, leaks, rumors, and more I think I made a huge mistake with my iPhone 14 Pro Max",

                    "body": "The iPhone 14 Plus isn't selling well, and the same was true for the model it replaced, the iPhone 13 mini. With that in mind, it seems reasonable for Apple reduce the number of product lines it offers.\n\nThere are currently five iPhone models in production. Dropping to four would benefit the company and its customers.\n\nFall of 2020 brought the four models in the iPhone 14 series. Among the big news was that the diminutive iPhone 13 mini was replaced by a much larger iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nDuring the two years Apple made the mini, neither of the two iterations ever sold well. Perhaps buyers expected Apple's smallest handset to also be its cheapest, not $700.\n\nOn the other hand, the 5.4-inch screen in the mini may have not been a factor after all. Its 6.1-inch replacement doesn't seem to be selling any better.\n\nApple never reveals how many of each of its models it sells, but analysts publish their estimates. Data from Counterpoint Research shows that three of the four iPhone 14 models came out of the gate strong. In November 2022, the iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro were the top three selling smartphones in the world. The latest iPhone SE was on the best-seller list, too. But the iPhone 14 Plus didn't make the cut.\n\nThat's not our only data. Ross Young from DSCC reported in February how many LCD panels were being delivered for the new iOS handsets. This indicates Apple is hardly making any iPhone 14 Plus units any more... apparently because people aren't buying them.\n\nDesigning and making a smartphone isn't cheap, even when it's a variation on another model. It makes little sense to continue producing four variations of each new iPhone generation when only three of them sell well.\n\nThis isn't an attack on the iPhone 14 Plus. I have one and I love it. It is just what I wanted: an iOS handset with a 6.7-inch screen that I didn't have to pay $1100 for.\n\nBut that data from the analysts at Counterpoint I mentioned earlier shows that far more people were willing to pay extra for all the additional features of the iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nWith that in mind, Apple should stop putting R&D efforts into models that comparatively few people want. I think we'd all prefer it instead go into other areas.\n\nI'm sure we all have suggestions on where to spend the freed-up R&D money. I'd like more effort to go into making iOS 99.99% bug free. But there are plenty of other ways.\n\nI'm well aware that Apple CEO Tim Cook won't read this editorial. Besides, the top-level Apple executives have access to direct data showing that people are staying away from the iPhone 14 Plus in droves, just as they did the iPhone 13 mini.\n\nThe people I'm talking to are Apple fans, and they should be aware of the possibility that there'll be fewer Apple models in the future.\n\nLeaks tell us it won't happen with the iPhone 15 series -- expect four new versions this autumn. But it would make sense for the iPhone 16 series to be made up of three models.\n\nWhat we should expect in 2024 is a large Pro Max flagship device packed with features, a Pro version with a smaller screen but nearly all the other features of the Max, and an iPhone 16 \"standard\" version with a reduced feature set but a lower cost.\n\nAdd in the iPhone SE 4 and that's four new Apple handsets. All of which have predecessors with proven track records.\n\nCutting down to just the best-selling models seems the logical course. Even if it means the Plus has to go away.",

                    "body": "iPhone 15 Pro to get iPhone SE 3, iPhone 8 type specs! Amazing Apple move\n\nHere is a crazy deal to grab an iPhone at an affordable price. All thanks to a tempting deal available on Amazon which lets you buy an iPhone for under \u00a3130. Yes, this is true! The deal is exclusively available on iPhone 8 which comes with a classic touch ID and vintage look of the iPhone. Read on to know all about this remarkable deal on the iPhone 8.\n\nIt must be noted that during the launch, the iPhone 8 was released at a starting price of \u00a3699 for the 64GB model. Currently, Amazon has marked it at an insanely low price of just \u00a3128. Wondering how? Well, this is because this iPhone comes as a refurbished device.\n\nThis means this pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by Amazon-qualified vendors before being listed for sale. It is also eligible for a replacement or refund within 1-Year of receipt if it does not work as expected. Amazon also says that it is in \"Excellent condition\". It shows no signs of cosmetic damage visible from a distance of 30 centimetres. However, accessories may not be original but will be compatible and fully functional. And, it may come in a generic box.\n\nLaunched back in 2017, the iPhone 8 features an all-glass back and front, with an aluminium frame. It features a 4.7-inch Retina HD display and is powered by the A11 Bionic chipset. The cameras on iPhone 8 Plus are custom tuned for the ultimate AR experience. Each camera is individually calibrated, with gyroscopes and accelerometers for accurate motion tracking.\n\nFor photography, the iPhone 8 has a single 12MP camera at the back and can shoot 4K video at 60fps. It also has a 7MP front-facing camera that supports portrait mode and has Retina flash. The best part is that it supports the latest iOS 16 update.",

Those rumors have lately included the feature coming to the iPhone 15 Pro, but more often it's been expected for 2024's iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nNow in a brief tweet, display analyst Ross Young claims we could be lucky to see it before the iPhone 17 Pro.\n\nIf under-display Face ID does make its first appearance in 2025's iPhone 16, it will bring to an end eight years of the notch.",

Shoppers who buy a 128GB Phone 14 Pro along with 75GB of data will save \u00a3432 over two years.\n\nThe combined iPhone 14 Pro handset and 75GB of data costs \u00a350 a month, which is similar to some competitive provider's handset-only prices. The same handset at Vodafone currently costs \u00a347 per month (and \u00a349 upfront costs) and does not include the price of data or SIM connection.\n\nREAD MORE: Apple launches yellow iPhone 14 with host of new deals\n\nThe deal on the Pro handset comes as Apple announce a new yellow colourway on the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models, but the Pro handsets will not get the new feature.\n\nSky's price drop on the handset could be an incentive for shoppers to buy the model, despite it not being available in the new signature yellow.\n\nFor those who have their eyes on the upcoming colour release, Sky seems to have confirmed it'll stock the spring-like colour, as it launches a landing page on the Sky Mobile site. Customers can place a 'Hello Sunshine' order from 8am on Monday, March 14.\n\nSeeing as though the current 75GB data deal won't be available on the new yellow handset (the iPhone 14 and iPhone Plus) shoppers could still make a saving with another one of Sky's offers. Users can save \u00a360 in total (which equates to \u00a35 per month) on its 20GB data plan.\n\nCompatible with the majority of smartphones offered at Sky, including the iPhone 14 range, the newest Samsung S23 range, and the latest Oppo phones, it may be one for customers to consider.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nApple iPhone 14 review: what you should know before you buy\n\nApple AirPod Pro dupes slashed to \u00a39.99 and they have same features as \u00a3170+ model\n\nThe cheapest S23, S23+ and S23 Ultra deals as latest Galaxy handsets launch in UK stores\n\nThree Mobile launches 'social tariff' contract for phone users struggling with cost of living\n\nI tried Lakeland's Ninja Air Fryer dupe and my cooking tastes better than ever",

                    "body": "iPhone 15 Pro will debut a new, more powerful and efficient LiDAR sensor\n\nApple has become a specialist in developing great cameras for its devices. Of course, this is not going to be an exception for the upcoming iPhone 15, and in particular, the iPhone 15 Pro. After numerous leaks, it is once again rumored that the top of the range iPhone will mount the most advanced LiDAR scanner we have seen to date.\n\nAccording to analysts at Barclays (Blayne Curtis and Tom O'Malley), there is a strong possibility that Sony will supply the components needed to manufacture this new LiDAR sensor that would be in the iPhone 15 Pro. Thanks to this upgrade, the iPhones might be able to take their camera to the next level. The report didn't say much more about whether we would see this sensor for the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, but it will most likely be relegated to the Pro range.\n\nAs reported by MacRumors, Ming-Chi Kuo explained last month that Sony may have replaced the manufacturers of the previous sensor. Apparently, Sony's manufacturing method would be much more efficient and would provide greater power if possible. If true, the iPhone 15 Pro would give us photographs that would be spectacular to say the least.\n\nAnd this sensor is not new. The LiDAR sensor has been in Apple devices since the iPad Pro. Then, it made the leap to the iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro. While on the iPad Pro the sensor served to improve our experience with augmented reality, on the iPhone it also serves for something else: to improve our photographs.\n\nThe LiDAR sensor measures distances based on how long it takes for a light beam to reach an object and return to the sensor. On the photography side, the iPhone makes use of LiDAR to improve low-light situations. As a result, it increases focusing accuracy and also makes it faster (autofocus is up to 6 times faster in low light).",

                    "body": "Apple chose a color that wasn't historically popular among iPhone buyers.\n\nApple has released a yellow iPhone 14, continuing its recent tradition of adding a new color option to the latest iPhone lineup every spring to keep consumers interested.\n\nThe banana yellow color is only available for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, not the Pro models. Pre-orders will open tomorrow (March 10 and the actual phone will be available on March 14. The iPhone 14 lineup originally came in five color options: black, blue, white, red and purple.\n\nApple releases a new iPhone every September, usually with a new set of color options. It's unusual for a popular electronic gadget to introduce a new color several months after launch, but the trick has become an effective marketing practice for Apple to boost demand in what could otherwise be a slow season for iPhone sales.\n\nLast year, Apple released a green iPhone 13 and an \"alpine green\" iPhone 13 Pro, adding to the lineup's black, blue, starlight (an off-white color), red and pink color options. In 2021, Apple introduced a purple iPhone 12 seven months after the phone's initial launch in late 2020.\n\nThis year, in addition to the yellow iPhone 14, Apple also released several new spring-themed color options for the Apple Watch band and silicone iPhone cases.\n\nYellow iPhones have had mixed success\n\nApple's choice of bright yellow is somewhat surprising because the color wasn't historically popular among iPhone buyers. The company last offered a yellow phone in 2019 with the release of iPhone 11, which also came in black, white, red, purple and green.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by MacRumors, a website for all Apple-related information, in March 2020, yellow was the least popular color with only 3.5 percent of respondents voting for it as their favorite iPhone color. The most popular color was red, which had nearly 30 percent votes, followed by black and white.\n\nOther consumer surveys have shown iPhone shoppers generally prefer neutral colors such as black and white. Purple, which is rumored to be Apple founder Steve Jobs's favorite color, also has a loyal following. Purple is available for iPhone 14, iPhone 12 and iPhone 11.\n\nAside from iPhone 11, Apple's only other yellow phones were 2018's iPhone XR and 2012's iPhone 5c. But neither model was part of the main iPhone lineup of that year. They were marketed as cheaper alternatives to 2018's iPhone XS and 2012's iPhone 5, respectively.",

                    "body": "Apple's next flagship is becoming more and more rounded, fast and expensive. However, its \"good\" features seem to hide the occasional unpleasant surprise.\n\nIn 2022, the European Union finally made USB-C mandatory: now, all mobile devices had to have it. One of the most affected companies has been Apple, since it claimed the use of its own port, Lightning. However, the Cupertino company has had no choice but to comply with the law, but in its own way.\n\nA well-respected insider within the Apple community has confirmed one of the rumors that we feared the most: the USB-C that will integrate the iPhone 15 will be capped as standard in all versions. The insider (the well-known ShrimApplePro) claims that iPhone cables will have to be MFi (Made For iPhone) certified.\n\nAccording to this insider's sources, Foxconn is already manufacturing accessories such as cables and EarPods with this certification. But does this mean that you can no longer use third-party cables? Nothing could be further from the truth: your cables will still work as usual and you will be able to use them with the next iPhone 15. However, the experience will be somewhat different.\n\nFor starters, if a cable doesn't have MFi certification the charging speed will be limited, as will data transfer. So if you don't use certified accessories, you won't be squeezing all that the iPhone 15 can offer.\n\nThe iPhone 15s is expected to arrive at the some point in September with a new rounder design, new materials, colors, haptic buttons, next-generation WiFi and of course, the new 3nm A17 chip.\n\nThe truth is that as appealing as the new iPhone 15 sounds, Apple must now make a greater effort than ever to motivate demand for it. Sales of the iPhone 14 (and especially the iPhone 14 Plus) have taken a big dip compared to other years and there are several reasons for this. Inflation, price increases and the lack of new features have led the public to opt for the Pro and Pro Max models, which are much more attractive in terms of quality and price. Will we finally see a more affordable iPhone 15 this year?",

                    "body": "Apple is expected to introduce a slew of big display changes with its upcoming iPhone 15 series.\n\nApple widened the gap between the Pro and non-Pro iPhones by limiting some features just to the iPhone 14 Pro series models last year. One of the most notable features of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is the Super Retina XDR display.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there's a lot of hype surrounding the potential display changes on the next-gen iPhones. A recently surfaced leak via tipster ShrimpApplePro suggests Apple plans to bring Dynamic Island to the entire iPhone 15 series.\n\nApple has neither confirmed nor denied these speculations as of this writing. In other words, it is unclear whether the iPhone 15 lineup will get major screen size changes over its predecessors.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that the standard iPhone and Pro models adopt Apple's winning formula, so there's a slim chance the company will attempt something unexplored. Nevertheless, the upcoming iPhone models could bring subtle changes to the current-gen iPhone 14 lineup.\n\nSuppliers in the iPhone supply chain say iPhone 15 series will pack a powerful A17 Bionic chipset under the hood. As a result, the upcoming iPhone models will get major specification upgrades over the iPhone 14 series. On the other hand, a Tom's Guide report suggests the iPhone 15 range is expected to retain most of the features of the current iPhone lineup.\n\nTo recall, Apple released four iPhone models in two sizes last fall. This includes the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro with a 6.1-inch display, and the iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 14 Pro Max with 6.7-inch screens.\n\nA TrendForce report says Apple will launch four iPhone models this fall. The lineup could comprise iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max handsets.\n\nLeaker ShrimpApplePro believes the next iPhones will retain the sizes of the current iPhone 14 lineup. If this speculation turns out to be true, the iPhone 15 range will include 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models, along with a couple of 6.7-inch phones. However, leaked iPhone 15 CAD renders show the standard iPhone 15 model sports a 6.2-inch screen, slightly larger than the iPhone 14's display size.\n\nA new leak shows that the screens of the upcoming iPhones will have curved bezels. Aside from this, the leaked display images show all iPhone 15 series models have Dynamic Island cutouts.\n\nApple ousted the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max's notch in favour of the Dynamic Island last fall. To those unaware, Dynamic Island alludes to a cut-out for the selfie camera and FaceID sensors that also shows alerts and notifications. This time, the feature will not be limited to the iPhone Pro offerings. If the rumours are accurate, this will be a striking feature on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max's screen will reportedly support a peak brightness of 2,500 nits. This will further widen the gap between Apple's high-end phones and standard offerings. Furthermore, this means the iPhone 15 Pro Max will have a brighter display than the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, which feature 2,000-nit displays. It also outperforms the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra screen, which delivers 1,750 nits of peak brightness.\n\nApple transitioned to an adaptive refresh rate with the iPhone 13 in 2021. The screens support up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling. On the downside, this feature is limited to the Pro models. So, the non-Pro iPhone models have displays with a 60Hz refresh rate. It will be interesting to see whether the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus come with improved refresh rates.",

Interestingly, Apple's iPhone 13 tops the list, and 8 out of 10 most-sold devices were by Apple. Samsung barely managed to take to positions.

Out of all Android brands around the world, Samsung managed to sell most devices. Also Read - Apple fixes Siri remote bug with new tvOS update\n\nStarting from the top, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max were the top three most-sold devices. Also Read - Apple introduces Yellow coloured iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus: Check price, availability\n\nFollowing them, the Samsung Galaxy A13 took the 4th position with a 1.6 percent share. The next five most sold phones were again iPhones - The iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone SE 2022.\n\nLastly, the Galaxy A03 -- another Galaxy A series phone -- managed to grab the 10th spot.\n\nThis list is enough to show how Apple devices are widely popular globally and Samsung flagships don't come near.\n\nSince the Apple iPhone 13 was the most sold phone, let's see what it offered. Before we do a recap of its specs, it's worth noting that the iPhone 13 still appears to have good sales figures. Probably because the 14 doesn't offer much when compared to the 13. Also, 13 is way cheaper right now.\n\nRecap of iPhone 13 specs\n\niPhone 13 was launched back in September 2021. It sports a 6.1-inch OLED display with an 1170 x 2532 pixels resolution. It has a Ceramic Sheild glass for protection. It has a dual camera system with a 12MP main and a 12MP ultra-wide lens. There's a 12MP selfie snapper placed on the front notch panel.\n\nIt is powered by Apple's 5nm A13 Bionic chip paired with 4GB of RAM and up to 512GB of internal storage. It packs a 3,240mAh battery with a not-so-fast charging speed. It currently boots on iOS 16 OS.\n\nPublished Date: March 9, 2023 6:31 PM IST For the latest tech news across the world, latest PC and Mobile games, tips & tricks, top-notch gadget reviews of most exciting releases follow Techlusive India's Facebook, Twitter, subscribe our YouTube Channel.

                    "body": "There have been very few times that iPhone was blessed with a new colour. This time it's the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in a sweet shade of yellow. It is the same iPhone, specs-wise, but in a brand new colourway. So, besides checking out the iPhone 14 features, here we'll take a look at the special iPhone colours we have seen so far.\n\nBesides the colour, the phones carry the same technical specifications and features as the other coloured models.\n\nThat means you get OLED displays, iOS 16, A15 Bionic chipset, 12+12MP rear camera setup, 12MP selfie snapper, 4K60 video recordability from both sides, 15W Magsafe, Face ID, UWB support, among other things. The Plus model has a bigger display and a bigger battery size.\n\niPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro got Alpine Green colourways. The colour aside, both iPhone 13 variants ship with OLED, iOS 15 (upgradeable to iOS 16.3), A15 Bionic chipset, 12+12MP rear camera duo, 12MP selfie shooter, 4K60 video from both sides, Face ID, 15W MagSafe, and UWB support.\n\nThe battery and screen size does differ between the two models.\n\nThis was one of the first times we got a special coloured iPhone (excluding Product Red). Both iPhones came with OLED screens, iOS 14.1 (upgradeable to iOS 16.3), an A14 Bionic processor, a 12+12MP duo on the back, 12MP front camera, 4K60 videography from both sides, Face ID, 15W MagSafe, and UWB support.\n\niPhone 12 primarily differs from iPhone 12 mini in terms of its display and battery size.\n\nPretty much all of the recent iPhones have a special Product Red edition. The company says, \"Every Apple (PRODUCT)RED purchase contributes to the Global Fund's fight against AIDS and COVID\u201119\".",

                    "body": "Many similarities, few differences: this is what the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 look like on the inside\n\nBuying a new iPhone is never an easy decision. Apple terminals are not exactly \"cheap\" compared to other competing options and in the end, all we want is to find our ideal device. In this case, we will take a closer look at two phones that a priori are quite similar, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 13.\n\nThe iPhone 14 is the successor to the iPhone 13 but nevertheless, its few new features make the latter a very valid option to consider. Because of this, we've decided to bring both handsets head to head and put them head to head. Which is the better iPhone for you? That's something we'll find out below.\n\nThe truth is that the situation that occurred at Apple last year during the launch of the latest iPhones had never been experienced before in the brand. The announcement of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus was marked by an unusual fact: for the first time, they had the same processor as their predecessor, the A15 Bionic chip. However, the iPhone 14 is much more than its processor and these are some of the most important changes it brought:\n\nWhen comparing the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 13, the design is what is most striking, but not for the reasons you think. Its total lack of changes makes it seem that we are dealing with the same terminal: its only differences are the slight increase in thickness of the iPhone 14 (0.02 cm) and its new colors.\n\nThe photographic section of the iPhone has always been exceptional, whether you have the standard model or the Pro. And that is something that has not changed in either the iPhone 13 or the iPhone 14. Both have a two-camera module virtually identical at first glance. However, the differences are found on the inside:\n\nTo summarize, the most interesting improvements brought by the iPhone 14 compared to the 13 are its Action mode, the inclusion of the Photonic Engine and better pictures in low light conditions. On the other hand, we have Action Mode, another software feature that allows you to adjust camera shake to stabilize the video as much as possible.\n\nThe Photonic Engine is a computational technology that is responsible for improving photos via software. Thanks to this improvement, the iPhone 14 can take brighter photos than its predecessor. In addition to the larger focal aperture, you'll see that your photos gather much more light overall.\n\nMoreover, it is not any kind of setting that the user must activate: Photonic Engine will always act to improve each and every one of your shots. The models that have Photonic Engine are currently the iPhone 14, the iPhone 14 Plus, the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nAs you know, Apple repeats the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14 (and iPhone 14 Plus). The new A16 Bionic chip is reserved for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. Although we keep the same processor, the truth is that Apple has incorporated the A15 Bionic that carried the iPhone 13 Pro instead of the iPhone 13 (same clock frequency but with an extra GPU core). However, don't be fooled: it's still practically the same chip.\n\nHowever, in the RAM section we do see changes. Now, the iPhone 14 goes from 4 GB to 6 GB. A leap more than necessary and that will help your iPhone to last over time.\n\nOn the battery side, Apple promises to have boosted the iPhone 14's battery to give us an extra hour of video playback. In numbers, this translates from 19 hours on the iPhone 13 to 20 hours on the iPhone 14.\n\nThis is perhaps one of the most interesting new features of the iPhone 14 by far. Apple made a lot of emphasis on this functionality during the presentation of these models and it is not for less. Thanks to accident detection (also available on the Apple Watch Series 8) your iPhone 14 can detect when you have been involved in a car accident. This is possible thanks to its improved sensors (microphones, gyroscopes, etc.) that can recognize when there has been a collision and autonomously call emergency services.\n\nThe truth is that it is difficult to justify this generational \"leap\" due to the few changes we see between the two terminals. Apple sells both models on its website with a difference of 100 euros in price (the iPhone 13 currently costs 909 euros and the iPhone 14, 1,009 euros). In view of this, there is no compelling reason to choose the iPhone 14 over the iPhone 13 today.\n\nThe iPhone 13 is a very valid terminal and beats the iPhone 14 by a landslide in its quality/price ratio. Whatever your final decision, you'll be taking home two great phones.",

Reduce exposure to loud noise while using AirPods with THIS trick\n\nApple enthusiasts are in for a treat as Apple has recently taken the wraps of a new form of the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus. The non-Pro iPhone 14 models debuted last year with five colour options - Midnight, Starlight, Product RED, Blue, and Purple. Now, there's one more option to choose from as Apple has introduced a new Yellow colour.\n\nThe Yellow colour has not been seen on iPhones for some time now. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 series had new shades of colours but not yellow, and the last time it was seen was with the iPhone 11. Apple announces one bonus colourway for its iPhones every year. Last year, the iPhone 13 and the iPhone 13 Mini got the green colour whereas the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max received the Alpine Green colour.\n\nWith the introduction of this new colour midway through the iPhone's first year, Apple perhaps aims to boost sales of the non-Pro iPhone 14 models. And those looking to purchase this new colour option can pre-order the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus starting March 10 at 6:30 PM IST. Both iPhones will be available for purchase starting March 14, priced at Rs. 79900 and Rs. 89900 respectively.\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 models will be available to customers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., the U.S., and more than 60 other countries.\n\nBuyers of the iPhone 14 series will also receive free two years of Emergency SOS via satellite and Find My via satellite features which are currently available in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the U.K., and the U.S., with rollout in several other countries later this month. Moreover, customers who purchase iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will receive three free months of Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness+ with a new subscription.\n\nThe iPhone 14 has a large 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display, while the iPhone 14 Plus has an even larger 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display. Both phones are powered by the A15 Bionic chipset, which features a 5-core GPU and a 6-core CPU. They also feature a dual rear camera setup consisting of a 12MP primary camera and a 12MP ultrawide camera.

                    "body": "Fancy a more colourful smartphone? Apple makes iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus now available in 'beautiful yellow'\n\nApple has quietly launched a new colour option for the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus, as it seeks to kickstart flagging sales of its entry-level smartphones.\n\nApple announced that \"a beautiful yellow joins the lineup\" for the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus. There are no new colour options for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nThe additional colour comes amid reports that Apple is encountering weak consumer demand for the base level iPhone 14, with consumers more focused on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nSales struggle?\n\nLast October TrendForce provided an insight to the market reception of the recently released iPhone 14 portfolio, at a time when household bills are heading in the wrong direction, soaring inflation, and an economic downturn - all of which was a real test of consumer appetite for the new handsets.\n\nTrendForce announced that iPhone 14 sales had been favourable but could not vanquish rising inflation, and noted that the market response to the iPhone 14 Plus has been \"lukewarm, escalating Apple's product adjustment process.\"\n\nIt predicted at the time that Apple had lowered production of the iPhone 14, but increased production of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nIn January this year TrendForce revised downward its estimate of Apple's iPhone 14 sales for 2022 to 78.1 million units.\n\nLast month Apple posted its biggest revenue fall since 2019, and its first profit miss in seven years, as well as its first iPhone sales decline since 2020.\n\nHello yellow\n\nIn the face of weak consumer demand, Apple opted to a tried and trusted move - namely releasing a new colour.\n\nRead also : Foxconn To Construct Factory In India - Report\n\nIt should be remembered that this time last year Apple released the green iPhone 13.\n\nApple said the new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, adds even more colour choices to the lineup this spring.\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's VP of Worldwide Product Marketing.\n\n\"The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone,\" said Borchers.\n\nAvailability\n\nThe new Yellow shade joins the iPhone and iPhone 14 Plus's existing colour schemes of Midnight (black), Starlight (white), Red, Blue, and Purple.\n\nApple last offered a Yellow colour option for the iPhone in 2019 with the iPhone 11.\n\nIn addition to the new colour, Apple added four new colours for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus silicone cases, including Canary Yellow, Olive, Sky, and Iris.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in Yellow will be available for pre-order on Friday, 10 March, with availability starting on Tuesday, 14 March.\n\nRead also : Apple Lends Globalstar $252m To Aid Satellite-Connected iPhones",

                    "body": "iPhones continue to be in demand across the globe and other brands still have a lot to learn\n\nApple saw massive demand for iPhones in 2022 and the latest industry report confirms those claims. The company had 8 iPhones in the top 10 smartphone models sold last year, with the other two spots taken by Samsung.\n\nThe likes of Google, OnePlus and Xiaomi are missing from the list, and the industry report courtesy Counterpoint Research shows the impact and demand for iPhones. Apple usually does well with the older iPhone models thanks to various special sale offers and high demand for iPhones that get price cut. There are some interesting mid-range, affordable additions on the list as well.\n\nAs this list clearly shows, Apple made merry with iPhone sales last year. Usually you see brands having one or two, or even three models in the top 10, but having 8 modes means that the ratio of iPhone buyers in 2022 went up significantly.\n\niPhone 13 was the best-seller for 8 months in 2022 and the streak ended when the iPhone 14 series was launched in September, which made the iPhone 14 Pro Max the popular choice among buyers. The other iPhone models in the picture are iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and even the iPhone SE 2022.\n\nWhen it comes to Samsung, you have two Galaxy A series phones that you wouldn't have expected to be on the list. The company has sold a lot of the Galaxy A13 and the Galaxy A3 phones, and it is likely that these affordable devices were sold in markets like India.\n\nThe list shows that brands like Xiaomi (Redmi Note) and OnePlus (Nord series) are nowhere close to becoming a major force, and even Realme needs to improve on its products to be part of these lists in the future.",

However, it doesn't matter which Apple phone you have, as these TikTok tricks that we will see below will work for all of them.\n\nThis TikTok, created by the user @nordic_scott, suggests a very peculiar idea that we can recreate in a very easy way. For this, he proposes a street photo where we only have to use three things: a reflection, the panoramic mode of our camera and someone to take the photo. If you have everything, you are ready to start.\n\nIn this other TikTok, user @chris_priestley suggests a way to get the most out of the triple lens of the iPhone Pro and Pro Max. In this case, he shows us how we can highlight background elements in our photos. To do this, it's as easy as zooming in while moving away from the center of attention of the capture. The result will surprise you.\n\nNow, the only thing left for you to do is one thing: try these tricks for yourself!",

                    "body": "The iPhone 13 saw solid pickup in markets like China, US, UK, Germany and France.\n\nThe iPhone 13 was the best-selling smartphone of 2022, according to data released by Counterpoint Research. Apple, in fact, dominated sales so hard, as many as eight iPhones were among the top 10 global bestsellers last year. The only other brand to figure in the list was Samsung, with two of its entry-level phones, Galaxy A13 and Galaxy A03, taking up the fourth and tenth positions. Chinese brands like OnePlus and Xiaomi were clearly a no-show.\n\nThe research firm's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker makes some startling observations. Apple is apparently the first brand to capture eight spots in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones. The list makes up about 19 percent of the total global smartphone sales in 2022. The iPhone 13, the best-selling smartphone of 2022, is said to have contributed 28 percent of total iPhone sales globally remaining No.1 each month since launch in September 2021 till August 2022 -- which is when Apple refreshed the lineup with iPhone 14.\n\nAlso Read | As Apple launches iPhone 14 in yellow, here's a look back at every iPhone colour ever launched\n\nThe iPhone 13 saw solid pickup in markets like China, US, UK, Germany and France while developing markets -seemingly -- embraced it more post price cuts after the launch of the iPhone 14 series. The iPhone 13 is followed by the iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the list, going on to highlight buyers' growing affinity to Apple's super-sized iPhone with the 14 Pro Max in particular setting new benchmark becoming a bigger performer than the vanilla -and even the pro -- iPhone 14, a first for Apple. The iPhone 14 Pro Max were the top-selling iPhones in September, October and November of 2022, the data suggests.\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone SE 22 took the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth positions, respectively.\n\nCounterpoint believes that the market share of the top 10 smartphones will increase and that brands will continue to make their portfolios leaner in 2023.",

                    "body": "Read Latest News on Sports, Business, Entertainment, Blogs and Opinions from leading columnists.\n\nthe iPhone 15 Pro It is expected to be a major development compared to the current model, as it will change the charging port by adopting USB-C, and it has a new, more rounded design without any physical buttons, while it also appears that it will have a greatly improved battery thanks to the new 3 nm engineering processor, which It will greatly increase performance. However, regardless of all these changes, one of the leading American investment firms thinks so Sales of the next generation iPhone will be great for a different reason.\n\nIn detail, private equity firm Wedbush Securities raised its target for Apple stock to $190. One of the reasons according to his official report and related publications CamelIs that More old users will move to the upcoming models of the iPhone 15 family. Wedbush appreciates that About one in four iPhone owners haven't upgraded their device in at least four years.\n\nSo, with performance showing signs of slowing, volumes filling up and battery draining faster after all this time, this is expected to be the year many finally decide to upgrade. Speaking about it, the investment company confirmed:\n\nWe estimate that approximately 25% of the currently installed iPhone base has not upgraded their iPhone in at least 4 years. With the long-awaited iPhone 15 expected to be launched in September, it appears that the delivery of iPhone 14 will be more stable than other iPhone generations in the past.\n\nIn fact, when the iPhone 14 first appeared, Apple was also facing serious problems due to the epidemic, and therefore it was unable to provide stores with the necessary inventory, and it may have lost many sales. Now that the global chip shortage has been largely overcome, the iPhone 15's debut is expected to do better in this regard as well.\n\nFinally, this year it seems that Apple will pay more attention to the simple iPhone 15 models, all of which will have, for example, Dynamic Island. And this could be a factor that will lead to better sales, since the simple iPhone 14 had slight differences compared to the previous generation.",

                    "body": "The next Pro iPhone's depth sensor could become more powerful and efficient\n\nApple could update the iPhone 15 Pro's LiDAR scanner, the first update the feature will have got since it was introduced, according to analysts from Barclays (via MacRumors (opens in new tab)).\n\nAnalysts Blayne Curtis and Tom O'Malley wrote in a recent report that the current LiDAR module, designed by Lumentum and manufactured by WIN, would be replaced by one designed and built by Sony.\n\nFellow leaker Ming-Chi Kuo (opens in new tab) (via MacRumors (opens in new tab)) has also claimed Apple was bringing a new LiDAR sensor to this year's new iPhones. The benefit of the new parts, Kuo says, will apparently be either more power efficiency or greater performance, depending on how Apple wants to tune the new parts.\n\nApple's not talked much about the LiDAR sensor on its pro iPhones since it arrived on the iPhone 12 Pro. However, given the sensor's use in augmented reality applications, and with Apple strongly rumored to be bringing out an AR/VR headset soon, it would make sense that the company would pick this iPhone generation to revamp the feature. Perhaps the sensors could be used to better support possible iPhone/headset feature integration.\n\nWe are still unlikely to see the LiDAR sensor added to the vanilla iPhone 15 models though. Just like a 120Hz refresh rate, a telephoto camera or Apple's latest chip, LiDAR is expected to be for Pro models only.\n\nWith Apple's normal iPhone launch window in September still six months away, there's more time for rumors such as those alleging USB-C ports, solid-state buttons on the Pro models and slightly curvier designs for the new models, to appear. And you'll be able to catch up on them all in our iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro hubs.\n\nLiDAR in the recent iPhones has arguably been a feature that's easy to forget about unless you're really into AR apps. But it does help with depth sensing, which can yield benefits with things like better depth of field in portrait photos.\n\nA more powerful LiDAR sensor could deliver the scope for better profile photos, allowing for more object separation and edge detection. This could be one way the iPhone 15 Pro models could hit back at the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and its excellent portrait photos; it currently tops our best camera phones list, beating the iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nAnd improved efficiency should help the iPhone 15 Pro offer better battery life even in the face of snapping loads of profile shots.\n\nBut the scanner may also be the key to supercharge AR apps and really bring them to the fore. In their current guise, they can be very handy (say, figuring out where to place a sofa or cupboards in a room via the IKEA app), but they lack any real killer apps or use cases. A next-gen LiDAR scanner could change that; time will tell.",

                    "body": "The story we are sharing with you today should not be tried to be replicated at home, even in less extreme water conditions. And it is that something as curious as striking has just happened: someone submerged their iPhone 11 for just over a week at the bottom of a lake, then in the end he was able to recover his phone and to everyone's surprise it was working.\n\nIt was the month of September 2019 when Tim Cook and all the people at Apple finally introduced us to the successor to the popular iPhone XR, a model that made a deep mark among users and that heralded a major change in the aesthetic line of this family.\n\nIn the end, that didn't exactly happen, since we haven't seen many variations in terms of the appearance of the front face and the rear camera module since then.\n\nBut the presentation of the iPhone 11 did attract attention due to the emphasis on the integration of its IP68 certification that guaranteed resistance to water and dust.\n\nAlmost 4 years have passed since the moment of presentation and it was until this moment that we witnessed, perhaps, the most extreme test ever conceived for this terminal. Where a human life was also saved.\n\nAccording to a report from friends of Balloona few weeks ago in the state of Brasilia, Brazil, the young student Breno Rafael was kayaking on Lake Paranoa when he saw a woman who was drowning.\n\nThe lady did not have a life jacket and everything became a life or death situation where quick thinking was the key difference. Rafael did not hesitate and rushed to save the girl, but when he took her to the shore safe and sound from her, the boy realized that he had lost her iPhone 11 in her rescue.\n\nThe most interesting thing happened a week later, when the instructor Edinho Rocha ended up locating the iPhone 11 deep in the lake at a depth of 7 meters.\n\nRocha recorded a video on social networks to try to find the owner and the thing became something viral that ended up being reported by local media:\n\nThe iPhone 11 was functional although it spent just over a week deep and ended up returning to its owner who lost it at the time to save a life.",

                    "title": "iPhone 13 Sweeps Global Phone Sales Chart: Key Takeaways From Counterpoint's Latest Findings",
                    "body": "Counterpoint Research has released its list of the ten highest-selling smartphones in the world in 2022. The list has made several eyebrows rise in surprise. That is because while some phones were expected to be among the annual bestsellers, there were some surprises and many notable absentees. This is what the ten highest-selling smartphones in the world in 2022 tell us:\n\nThe ten highest-selling phones of the year accounted for 19 per cent of the total phone sales of 2022, the same as the top ten did in 2021. However, the year in general saw the number of smartphone models in the market register a steep fall.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint, there were over 4,200 active smartphone models in the global market in 2021, but this number came down to around 3,600 in 2022, and is expected to decline even further.\n\nApple's iPhone has been the bestselling smartphone in the world for a while now. However, it seemed to hit a different level of domination in 2022.\n\nOf the ten highest-selling devices of the year, no fewer than eight were iPhones, up from seven in 2021.\n\nThere were iPhones at the top three positions and from the fifth to ninth position as well. All that stood between them and a perfect ten were two Samsung devices. The iPhone was the highest-selling smartphone in the world in every month of 2022.\n\nThe list of ten bestselling smartphones reveals a very curious contrast. Eight of the ten devices are iPhones, as we pointed out earlier, which are premium devices by any definition.\n\nHowever, the other two devices in this list of ten are actually relatively lower priced ones, and can even be called budget devices -- the Samsung Galaxy A 13 at number 4 and the Samsung Galaxy A03 at number 10.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A13 was launched at Rs 14,999, while the Galaxy A03 was launched at an even lower Rs 10,499.\n\nInterestingly, the predecessor of the Galaxy A13, the Galaxy A12 was also part of the top ten-selling phones list of 2021. The A series has always done well for Samsung.\n\nThe iPhone 13, released in 2021, turned out to be the highest-selling smartphone in the world in 2022. As per the data released by Counterpoint, the iPhone 13 was the highest-selling device in the world every month from January to August 2022.\n\nIt gave up its top spot only when the iPhone 14 series was released in September. Interestingly, the global sales trend of the iPhone 13 contrasts with the Indian one, where the phone's popularity shot up in the latter part of the year, thanks to a number of festive offers on it.\n\nThe iPhone 13 had an astounding 5 per cent share of the market in 2022 -- an amazing figure when you consider that the other nine phones in the list could not even manage 2 per cent each. In simple terms, one of every twenty smartphones bought in 2022 was an iPhone 13.\n\nEven the iPhone 12 which was the bestselling phone of 2021, had a share of 2.9 per cent in that year. In fact, the iPhone 13 sold more than the phones at number two and three put together and accounted for 28 per cent of all iPhones sold in the year.\n\nA notable absentee from the top ten list was Xiaomi. The Chinese brand had two devices in the top ten list of 2021 but drew a blank in 2022.\n\nSamsung's getting two budget devices in the top ten seems to indicate that the Korean brand has got itself back into the budget zone, where it had been losing ground to Xiaomi and other Chinese brands.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that none of the budget Android devices is from Motorola. Realme or OnePlus (whose Nord CE range ran up impressive numbers in India) made it to the top ten.\n\nIncidentally, the Samsung Galaxy A03 is the only device in the top ten to be running on a budget UniSoc processor.\n\nBoth the iPhone 13 Pro Max and its successor, the iPhone 14 Pro Max were criticized for their bulk and weight, and also for their hefty price tags. Both started at USD 1099 in the US, and the iPhone 13 Pro Max's starting price in India stood at Rs 1,29,900, while the iPhone 14 Pro Max started at Rs 1,39,900.\n\nYou would think that hefty phones with hefty price tags would not generally strike a chord with consumers, who would perhaps prefer devices that were easier on the pocket in every sense of the word. Well, that was so not the case in 2022.\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro Max and the iPhone 14 Pro Max were the second and third most popular smartphones of 2022, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max was actually the highest-selling phone in the world from September to November 2022, losing out to the iPhone 14 only in December 2022.\n\nIt is the first time a Pro Max variant has driven more sales than the Pro and base models of a series.\n\n2022 was the first year in a while in which no Chinese brand had a smartphone in the top ten bestselling smartphone list. This is surprising when you consider that there are a number of Chinese brands in the global top ten in terms of market share.\n\nXiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, Motorola, and Realme all have significant global market shares, and OnePlus is gaining popularity as well (https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile).\n\nHowever, no phone from these brands made the list of globally bestselling smartphones. That would seem to indicate that these brands' sales are spread over a wide portfolio of devices, rather than a few ones.\n\nIt was not smooth sailing for all iPhones, however. There were some notable absentees. None of the smaller iPhones -- the iPhone 12 mini or the iPhone 13 mini -- or the recently launched large-sized iPhone 14 Plus, made the top ten list.\n\nThe absence of the mini models is a surprise when you consider that these came with the lowest price tags of their series at the time of launch and generally received extremely favourable reviews.\n\nThat said, one relatively small iPhone did make the list -- the iPhone SE (2022) edition took ninth place, and after a very weak start (which led to many writing it off as a failure), ended the year as a regular member of the group of ten highest selling phones of the year.\n\nClearly, there is still room for a phone with a single camera and HD LCD display in the premium segment - the phone is believed to have done particularly well in Japan.\n\nThe absence of the iPhone 14 Plus from the list is a big surprise, when you consider that \"bigger\" iPhones like the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the iPhone 14 Pro Max were the second and third highest-selling phones of the year.\n\nIn fact, the iPhone 14 Plus is the only phone of the iPhone 14 series to not make it to the top ten -- the iPhone 14 Pro Max is at number 3, the iPhone 14 at number 7 and the iPhone 14 Pro at number 8.\n\nThey might have been grabbing headlines and getting rave reviews but Android flagships seem to have totally lost out to the iPhone in the premium segment.\n\nWe have not seen a premium Android device in the top ten list of phones for a few years now and 2022 was no different -- the only two Android devices in the list both started at prices below Rs 15,000. The likes of the high-profile Galaxy S22 series, the much-hyped foldables, and even the relatively more affordable flagships from OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Realme did not make the list, and neither did premium offerings from Oppo, Motorola and Vivo. None of the Pixels, past and present, across different price points made the list either.\n\nAndroid needs to up its premium game in 2023.\n\nThe \"senior citizen\" in the top ten best-selling smartphone list in 2022 was the iPhone 12. Released in 2020, the iPhone 12 was the highest-selling phone of 2021, and ended 2022 as the sixth highest-selling smartphone of the year, selling more units than the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nThe key factors for the success of this veteran were its still-sleek design, support for 5G and a number of price cuts and bargain offers.",

                    "body": "If you've experienced weird appointments or reminders appearing in your iPhone's Calendar app, you may be afraid that you have got an iPhone Calendar virus, or that your iPhone Calendar has been hacked. What's more likely is that you have been subscribed to a third-party calendar, which is generating annoying spam appointments.\n\nThis kind of calendar is becoming prolific, with more and more cases, so you are most certainly not alone in seeing these annoying appointments appear on your iPhone - in fact Macworld staff have also been affected by this irritating phenomenon.\n\nThankfully, iPhone calendar spam is not dangerous and should be easy to get rid of. This isn't an iPhone Calendar Virus, but it certainly feels like one when you get a load of appointments arrive on your iPhone. If you are concerned that you have a virus read: How to remove a virus from an iPhone or iPad for advice.\n\nHere's how to remove calendar spam on your iPhone - and how to avoid falling foul to this sort of attack.\n\nUnfortunately, because Apple's products are so interlinked, if you get spam in your iPhone calendar it's inevitable that it will also turn up on all your other Apple devices. The tips here should help you deal with the Calendar spam on your iPhone, iPad, Mac and anywhere else.\n\nThe usual route on to your iPhone is through emails and text messages that include invites to events in the form of an .ics file. Even if you decline them, this can leave an opening for hackers to send more invites to your calendar, which can lead to disastrous consequences.\n\nNumber-one rule: never click on any links or other active sections of the appointments. If you can, simply delete the event as normal, but the chances are you'll need to unsubscribe from the calendar as well, which we cover in the next section.\n\nWe received a message that came in via Messages via an iCloud address. Luckily we didn't open the message, but this is how it appeared - and because the message went to the Messages app it's on all our Apple products, which is a tad annoying!\n\nOthers have received a DHL spam text asking them to track a parcel and providing a link. Of course as soon as people click on the link they end up subscribing to a calendar that fills their iPhone with appointments for thing like critical threats and other warnings.\n\nWe have also heard from friends and family who are concerned about appointments alerting them to the need to protect their device. For example they might see a: \"Your iPhone might not be protected! Click to protect it!\" message. A link follows the message - under no circumstances should you click on the link!\n\nThe best advice for any text or email like that is to treat it as you would phishing emails, which try to trick you into giving away personal data. Don't interact with the appointments in any way, other than to delete them.\n\nIf the appointment arrived via a text in the Messages app to delete it you should swipe from right to left and choose Delete. Your iPhone may then offer to Report Junk, which we suggest you do.\n\nThen follow the next steps.\n\nIf a load of appointments have suddenly arrived on your iPhone what can you do? How can you get rid of the iPhone calendar spam?\n\nOne way is to follow these steps:\n\nIf that doesn't fix the problem, move onto the next step...\n\nIf you continue to receive spam invites, then it could be that the troublesome calendar has a subscription set up on your iPhone. Removing this is simple.\n\nThis should be all you need to do to stop the rogue appointments and reminders from appearing on your calendar.\n\nFor more ways to get organised, check out our guide to the best productivity apps.",

                    "body": "iPhones in 2022 seem to have ruled the world and where Androids are all over the market cancelling out each one's share, Apple's simple lineup of iPhones is giving good results across the globe. The simplified models that too launch a few of them a year help them sell more iPhones in the world than others.\n\nAs we all know Samsung and Apple are the biggest smartphone manufacturers in the world but did you know, the iPhone 13 sold as many as 73 million units worldwide just in 2022? A massive number is really unimaginable because the next three best-selling smartphones in 2022 as per Canalys if combined will total such a large number.\n\nThe next two smartphones in our list are the Samsung Galaxy A13, iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone SE (2022), which sold in the 25, and 24 million marks respectively. Though there are other phones including iPhone 14, Redmi Note 11 and others, what's interesting is that out of the Top 10, seven of them are by Apple!\n\nThis is the superpower Apple has because of a simple lineup and gaining the trust of its phones, people are relying on them without any hesitance. The psychological benefit Apple has gained with iPhone 13 is that it discounted the same when the new iPhone 14 series launched, increasing its value for money.\n\nAlso, as you will see there's not much difference between the 13 and 14 base variants, so people understood getting an iPhone 13 during the sale or even at the base price made more sense for those who needed an iPhone in general. Even in a mass market like India, making the iPhone 13 in-house and selling at lower prices, or slashing prices during big sales benefitted Apple.\n\nThis is why this 2021 iPhone made a greater impact last year making it the best-selling phone with 73 million units being sold in a calendar year! Do you own one for yourself or waiting for one for yourself? Let us know in the comments down below...\ud83d\ude01",

Kuo initially reported that its development was put on hold at the end of last year. However, Kuo's latest tweet spelt great news for those looking to buy an iPhone on a budget as the development of the iPhone SE 4 is underway and it will likely arrive in 2024 with some great features.\n\nNow, another report has revealed that the iPhone SE 4 is likely to use parts left over from the production of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14. Amazingly, the heretofore small iPhone SE is set to get amazingly big! According to a report by Korean publication The Elec, the iPhone SE 4 will likely use the 6.1-inch OLED displays manufactured by Chinese firm BOE using parts left over from the production of iPhone 13 and the latest iPhone 14. Yes, an iPhone SE as big as the iPhone 13 and 14! iPhone SE 4 launch date is expected in the Fall season of 2024.\n\nAlthough iPhone's OLED displays are usually manufactured by Samsung and LG, both companies could have their hands full with the iPhone 15 series which is set to debut later this year. The report by The Elec states, \"According to the industry on the 3rd, BOE is expected to supply 6.1-inch organic light emitting diode (OLED) for the low-end iPhone SE4, which is expected to be released next year. The iPhone SE series has so far only been released as a liquid crystal display (LCD) model, but next year's model is likely to be applied with OLED.\" (translated)\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 has been tipped to feature a 6.1-inch display which will be upgraded from LCD to OLED, bringing punchier colours and darker blacks. The report further states that the iPhone SE 4 will have a minor modification in design when compared to the iPhone 14. This would mark the first major design change in two generations of the iPhone SE. The iPhone SE 3 was launched in early 2022 and was essentially the same iPhone SE 2nd Gen with the newer A15 Bionic chip and a slightly larger capacity battery.\n\nKuo also reported that instead of using Qualcomm's modem chips, the iPhone SE 4 will feature a 5G modem based on a 4-nanometer process node, designed by Apple.",

                    "body": "Apple has launched the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in all-new \"yellow\" colourway, possibly to continue momentum and boost sales mid-cycle before the arrival of the next wave of iPhones in September. It joins the existing lineup of midnight, purple, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, and blue. Specs and pricing, naturally, remain the same.\n\nMost modern-day iPhones have a rich colour palette, but things weren't always this \"colourful\". The original iPhone, in fact, came in just one variant. The iPhones that followed were offered in varying shades of black and white. The iPhone 5 was perhaps the first stab at bold experimentation with its striking dual tone finish (though the base line was still black and white). Apple then went all in with the iPhone 5S and 5C, with the latter really taking things up a notch, both design and positioning wise.\n\nAlso Read | iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus launched in yellow; available to pre-order from March 10 in India\n\nCut to 2023, the latest iPhone 14 -now -- sells in as many as six colours. The iPhone XR was the last iPhone to be made available in as many colours. Even the iPhone 11, 12 and 13 came in five different hues. Bottomline, it's a good time to take a trip down memory lane and reminisce a bit at every iPhone colour ever launched.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in yellow will be available to pre-order from March 10 in India. You will be able to buy them in stores and online from March 14.",

                    "body": "Apple will reportedly limit its display features- Always-On and ProMotion- to the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max smartphone models. This means that the standard iPhone 15 will not come with the ProMotion feature, which speeds up parts of the screen when a faster rate is required and slows it down to save power, reports AppleInsider. Also Read - iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus may feature Dynamic Island on display\n\nThis also applies to the Always On display feature. According to leaker ayeux1122', \"Apple has already prepared to deliver the iPhone 15 series... panel to domestic companies, and it is said that it will soon confirm the details and prepare for mass production.\" Also Read - Apple iPhone 15 Pro might ditch 2 buttons for volume control\n\n\"What is confirmed here is that the specification supports LTPO 120 refresh rate only for the Pro series,\" the leaker added, \"and the basic normal plus model does not have the requirements.\" Earlier, it was rumoured that the iPhone maker will bring support for Wi-Fi 6E network to only iPhone 15 Pro models. Also Read - Apple iPhone 15 likely to feature USB Type-C, but with restrictions: Check details here\n\nIt was also reported that the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max will include new features such as solid-state buttons with haptic feedback, a titanium frame and increased RAM.\n\nApple is reportedly planning to equip the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus with the Dynamic Island, marking an end for the notch entirely from Apple's flagship iPhone series. This year's iPhone series, hence, may have a uniform display design, unlike last year's when Apple replaced the notch on the Pro iPhone models with the Dynamic Island. The display sizes of each iPhone model, however, will likely remain the same.\n\nAccording to tipster ShrimpApplePro, the iPhone 15 series would come with a Dynamic Island design. The tipster tweeted a video showing off the front design of the upcoming iPhone models. The video shows three glass casings belonging to at least three iPhone models. Three glass casings with the Dynamic Island design mean that the design will reach beyond the Pro iPhone models this year.\n\nInputs from IANS\n\nPublished Date: March 9, 2023 1:05 PM IST For the latest tech news across the world, latest PC and Mobile games, tips & tricks, top-notch gadget reviews of most exciting releases follow Techlusive India's Facebook, Twitter, subscribe our YouTube Channel.

                    "body": "* Apple has unveiled a new Yellow colour variant of its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus devices.\n\n* The new Yellow colour option joins the other five colours that are already available in the market.\n\n* Interested buyers will be able to pre-order the device starting March 10th in India.\n\nApple has announced a new yellow iPhone 14 & iPhone 14 Plus even more color choices to the lineup this spring.\n\nBeautifully designed and built to last, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have a durable Ceramic Shield front cover, an updated internal design for better sustained performance and easier repairs, and amazing battery life -- with iPhone 14 Plus offering the longest battery life of any iPhone ever.\n\nBoth models include a dual-camera system for stunning photos and videos, the powerful A15 Bionic chip, and innovative safety capabilities including Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection.\n\nThe new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available to pre-order this Friday, March 10, with availability starting Tuesday, March 14.\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing.\n\n\"The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.\"\n\nApple usually reserves at least one colour option for its iPhone devices, which it unveils mid-season (5-6 months before the launch of its next lineup).\n\nFollowing the tradition, the brand has now launched an all-new Yellow colour variant of its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus devices.\n\nThe new Yellow colour for the iPhone 14 devices joins an already extensive list of paint jobs available (midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT) RED, blue, and purple) and will soon start selling in the market.\n\nThe Pro models, however, have not been provided with the same treatment, and it looks like Apple might not be releasing a new colour option for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone14 Pro Max devices anytime soon.\n\nNevertheless, let's take a look at the new Yellow colour variant of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus devices.\n\nAs seen in the image above, this is what the new Yellow colour option for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus devices looks like.\n\nPlus, as far as accessories are concerned, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus will now have four new official covers - canary yellow, olive, sky, and iris.\n\nThe 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and 6.7-inch2 iPhone 14 Plus feature a durable aerospace-grade aluminium design that is water- and dust-resistant,3 with a Ceramic Shield front cover that is tougher than any other smartphone glass, protecting iPhone from common spills and accidents.\n\nAn updated internal design provides better sustained performance -- great for heavy workloads and high-powered gaming -- while improving ease and affordability of repairs.\n\nBoth models include a gorgeous Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology that supports 1200 nits of peak HDR brightness, along with support for Dolby Vision.\n\nA Powerful Dual-Camera System to Capture Every Moment with iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, users have an advanced dual-camera system right in their pockets.\n\nThe system features an impressive new pro-level Main camera with a larger sensor for gorgeous photos and videos, as well as an Ultra Wide camera to capture unique perspectives.\n\nBoth iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus include the new front TrueDepth camera that automatically focuses on multiple subjects at different distances for sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies.\n\nAnd the larger aperture captures brighter colour and finer detail in low-light scenes.\n\nThe iPhone 14 lineup introduced Photonic Engine, improving mid- to low-light performance for photos across all cameras compared to the previous generation: up to 2x on the TrueDepth and Ultra Wide cameras, and 2.5x on the new Main camera.\n\nPhotonic Engine is able to preserve subtle textures, provide better colour, and maintain more information in a photo through a deep integration of hardware and software.\n\nVideo features like Action mode and Cinematic mode are available across the iPhone 14 lineup to help users unleash their creativity.\n\nAction mode enables smooth-looking video that adjusts to significant shakes and motion -- even when video is being captured in the middle of the action. Cinematic mode supports 4K at 30 fps and 4K at 24 fps, enabling a beautiful depth-of-field effect that automatically changes focus in a simple and intuitive way to capture cinema-style moments.\n\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus offer critical safety capabilities that can provide emergency assistance when it matters most.\n\nEmergency SOS via satellite allows users to message with emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available through a combination of custom-designed components and deeply integrated software.\n\nAdditionally, if users want to reassure friends and family of their whereabouts while off the grid, they can open the Find My app and share their location via satellite.\n\nThis service -- which has already helped users in emergency situations in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the U.K. -- will come to Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal later this month.\n\nCrash Detection on the iPhone 14 lineup can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.\n\nApple-designed motion algorithms trained with over a million hours of real-world driving and crash record data combine with motion inputs from the new accelerometer and gyroscope, GPS, barometer, and microphone5 on iPhone to bring this innovative safety feature to life.\n\nWhen paired with Apple Watch, Crash Detection seamlessly leverages the unique strength of both devices to get users help efficiently.\n\nA15 Bionic brings powerful, pro-level performance to iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The 5-core GPU enables faster speeds for demanding workloads and even smoother graphics for video apps and high-performance gaming.\n\nA15 Bionic also powers camera features like Photonic Engine, Action mode, and Cinematic mode -- all while delivering extraordinary battery life and protecting critical privacy and security features like data encryption using the Secure Enclave.\n\nThe 6-core CPU with two performance and four efficiency cores handles intensive tasks with ease, and the 16-core Neural Engine is capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features in iOS 16 and third-party app experiences.\n\niOS 16 features the biggest update ever to the Lock Screen, with a multilayered effect that artfully sets subjects of photos in front of the time, widgets that offer information at a glance, and a new wallpaper gallery for inspiration.\n\nFocus gets even more powerful with a new way to connect to the Lock Screen and create Focus filters within apps.\n\nLive Activities help users stay on top of things that are happening in real time, such as a sports game or ride-share, right from the Lock Screen.\n\nIn Messages, users can edit a message, undo send, and mark conversations as unread.\n\nBrowsing in Safari gets even safer with passkeys, a next-generation credential that can't be phished or leaked.\n\nLive Text adds the ability to interact with text in video, quickly convert currency, and translate text. Users can also tap and hold on the subject of an image to lift it from the background and place it in apps like Messages.\n\niCloud Shared Photo Library offers a new way to seamlessly share photos with up to six family members.\n\nAnd with Apple Music Sing, users can sing along to their favorite songs with adjustable vocals and real-time lyrics.\n\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are designed to minimize their impact on the environment, including antenna lines that use upcycled plastic water bottles that have been chemically transformed into a stronger, higher-performance material.\n\nIn addition to featuring a re-architected internal design that offers improved repairability, iPhone 14 models also use 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, including those in MagSafe, and 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine.\n\nBoth models also include 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of multiple printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards and in the wire of all cameras.\n\nFiber-based packaging does not use outer plastic wrap, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025.\n\nEmergency SOS via satellite and Find My via satellite are currently available in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the U.K., and the U.S., and will be available in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal later this month.\n\nThe service will be included for free for two years starting at the time of activation of a new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nCustomers who purchase iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will receive three free months of Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness+ with a new subscription.\n\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus Silicone Cases will be available in four new colours: canary yellow, olive, sky, and iris.\n\nPreviously , iPhone 14 & iPhone 14 plus models were available in five different colours - Blue, Midnight, Purple, Starlight, and (Product) RED.\n\nThe iPhone 14 has a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 14 Plus has a 6.7-inch display.\n\nThe devices have upgraded processors and cameras, as well as a crash-detection feature that alerts emergency services if the phone detects you've been in a car accident and an emergency SOS feature that uses satellites.\n\nAlso Read: iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus Tipped to Launch in New Yellow Colour Soon: Apple Yellow IPhone 14 Next Week?\n\nAlso Read: IPhone 14 Pro Max Clone Smartphone available under Rs 10000 : Price, Specifications",

                    "body": "In 2017 and 2018, the company released red versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 lines, respectively. In 2021, it added a purple iPhone 12. Last year, it released green versions of both the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro. -- Apple\n\nApple Inc. is returning to a frequent trick it uses to keep buyers interested in its current iPhone line until the new model arrives: adding a new color.\n\nThe company announced a yellow version of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus on Tuesday, adding to the existing midnight, blue, purple, red and starlight options. The new model - which doesn't add any additional enhancements - becomes available for preorder on March 10 and will go on sale in retail stores on March 14, the company said.\n\nThe color addition gives Apple a new way to market a product that went on sale about six months ago - keeping it top-of-mind for consumers at a time when the iPhone 15 launch is still another six months away. Apple has used the tactic frequently in recent years.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, the company released red versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 lines, respectively. In 2021, it added a purple iPhone 12. Last year, it released green versions of both the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro.\n\nFor 2023, the company hasn't added a new iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max color. Those models continues to come in black, gold, silver and purple.\n\nWith the next generation of iPhone, expected in September, Apple is planning to add the Dynamic Island - the new interface at the top of the device - to the lower-end versions. Though the standard iPhone 15 will retain the look of the previous model, the iPhone 15 Pro will get more significant changes, including a new titanium design, faster processor and periscope camera with much-improved zoom.\n\nAs it has done in the past, Apple has also added new colors for its iPhone cases and watch bands. In the coming months, the company is also planning new Macs - including new MacBook Air models and the first Apple Silicon-based Mac Pro - as well as the introduction of its first mixed-reality headset. - Bloomberg",

                    "title": "Apple iPhone Sales Dominate 8 Spots In World's Top 10 Phones",
                    "body": "Say what you want about the Apple iPhone, but its sales numbers are simply astounding. Counterpoint, a leading technology market research company, has discovered that eight out of the World's Top 10 Bestselling Smartphones for 2022 were from the Cupertino firm. Here's the breakdown on the facts.\n\nAs you can see in this chart, the vanilla Apple iPhone 13 led the way for global sales until the 14 series was launched. From there, the vanilla iPhone 14 then began its steady ascent to the top and concluded the year as the most saleable smartphone on this planet. The rest of the list is composed of various Apple iPhone sales numbers, but another interesting callout is the position of the iPhone 12.\n\nIt's an older device released in 2020 yet still remained one of the world's top contenders for the year, two years after its release. This just shows that hordes of consumers willing to go on the Apple train opt for an older device due to its relative affordability. Also, it's a testament to the buyers' faith that the company will continue to support an older product, so they're more inclined to take a risk on an aging device. Props to Apple and their reliable software updates for years and years, which is important to a lot of people (especially for expensive purchases).\n\nAnother observation from this fact is that consumers do prefer older flagship devices over newer, lower-range models. That's why the SE 2022 has not quite achieved Top 5 status ever since its release. However, it doesn't experience the same drastic drop that the Apple iPhone 12 undergoes upon the release of the 14 models. We can hypothesize that those who were aiming for the 12 within this timeframe got something within the 13 lineup instead thanks to sudden discounts and promotions driven by a new release.\n\nMeanwhile, those who could afford to upgrade to something within the 14 family just did. Simple as that.\n\nThis doesn't really apply to Android devices as the only two in this list are entry-level Samsung A models. These are simply essential or beginner smartphones for emerging markets, which is why they sell en masse. People purchase these not because they WANT a Samsung particularly, but because it's the safest option for a SMARTPHONE (in general) that won't break the bank. After all, even the cheapest iPhone is still out of a significant amount of the population's grasp. You buy an iPhone because you want an iPhone, not because you need a phone.\n\nWe can imagine that the primary reason why we don't see any midrange or flagship Android devices here is that sales are divided between the fierce competition of brands. As such, despite Samsung's fame, none of the S-series models have infiltrated this list.\n\nThe notable device that's missing from this \"dominated by Apple iPhone sales list\" is the forgotten iPhone 14 Plus. Some may attribute it as a commercial flop - not because it did anything particularly bad, but because it failed to provide value that matched its siblings.\n\nAnyway, it's quite understandable why Apple iPhone sales are as sky-high as they are. We go in-depth here, but the cultural impact, ease of use, a unified ecosystem, software longevity, and its brilliant marketing as a social tool have all played a part in propelling this humble device to where it is now. Definitely deserved.",

                    "body": "Turning the rumor true, we now have a new color option for the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus. Both are now available in a new yellow color and will be available in 60 countries, including, India, the US, the UK, and more. Check it out below!\n\nThe iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus's Yellow option joins the existing Midnight, Starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, Blue, and Purple colors. It will be up for pre-order on March 10 and will be available to buy, starting March 14.\n\nThe price is the same as the existing color options. The iPhone 14 in Yellow is priced at Rs 79,900 (128GB), Rs 89,900 (256GB), and Rs 1,09,900 (512GB). The iPhone 14 Plus in Yellow retails at Rs 89,900 (128GB), Rs 99,900 (256GB), and Rs 1,19,900 (512GB).\n\nAs opposed to the bright red color option, the yellow one looks quite subtle but is still polarizing. Check it out below and do share your thoughts on this and whether or not you will buy it.\n\nAs for the specs, there won't be any difference. The new iPhone 14 and the 14 Plus come with a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, respectively, with up to 1200 nits of brightness and a layer of Ceramic Shield. Both are powered by last year's A15 Bionic chipset with a 5-core GPU.\n\nThe camera system involves 12MP dual rear snappers and a 12MP selfie shooter (with Autofocus), along with the goodness of the Photonic Engine. There's support for camera features like Action Mode, Cinematic mode, portrait mode, and more. You can get a battery life of up to 26 hours.\n\nAdditionally, the iPhone 14 and the 14 Plus come with iOS 16, Crash Detection, Emergency SOS (in select countries), 5G, and an IP68 rating, among other things. You can also check out our iPhone 14 Plus review to know more about it if you plan on making the purchase either in the new yellow or any other option.",

                    "body": "In September, Apple unveiled the iPhone 14 range, comprising the 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. When reviewing the iPhone 14, I declared it was a device in search of a reason to exist. In hindsight, that's a little harsh. So, with the release of the iPhone 14 in yellow this week, I wanted to use it as an opportunity to give the cheapest iPhone in the 14 range another chance at winning me over.\n\nI have to say, the colour choice certainly helps its cause. As someone who wears all black, all the time, the yellow iPhone 14 really pops and I'm genuinely considering jumping down from the 14 Pro Max just for aesthetics alone.\n\nApple announced the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus were getting an additional colour just yesterday. Despite using terms such as Midnight, Purple, Starlight and (PRODUCT)RED to describe the other colours in the range, the yellow iPhone is just yellow. It's hard to describe the colour and in every spot we tried to take pics of this thing, the yellow looked real different. It's not a yellow that slaps you in the face, it's more subdued, softer, but not baby yellow, lemon but not harsh. Here's what we mean.\n\nLast year, Apple added a green colour to both its standard 13 and 13 Pro range, but it's just the 14 and Plus getting an addition this year. Could it be because Apple is soon to release a new, more budget-friendly SE? Or could it just be that Apple loves being Apple and getting everyone to make a big song and dance about a new device that's the same just with a different colour?\n\nThe iPhone 14 in yellow is in every way the same as the other iPhone 14s. The phone boasts powerful cameras, a photonic engine, Action Mode, Apple's A15 bionic chip, Emergency SOS via Satellite, Crash Detection, great battery life and the other standard Apple stuff. When reviewing the 14 in September, I said it was the 2021 iPhone 13 Pro with access to 2022 software. And that's sort-of where I decided the phone wasn't worth the money.\n\nKey to this argument was that the 512GB iPhone 14 was $150 more expensive than the 128GB iPhone 14 Pro. With the camera system and extra smarts the Pro has, it was hard to say that the 14 was worth it. Per the Apple website, the iPhone 14 in yellow follows the same pricing schedule:\n\nBut, to be honest, for many people 128GB is more than sufficient and the 128GB iPhone 14 is still $500 cheaper than the 128GB iPhone 14 Pro Max. It's a matter of individuality here, something I didn't necessarily take into account - you might not want a phone with all the bells and whistles and that's OK. Besides, the cheapest iPhone 14 is still leaps and bounds above the iPhone SE 5G.\n\nLike its predecessor, there are two cameras on the back, a main and an ultra-wide. While the main remains at 12MP, it's now paired with a faster, f/1.5 aperture, a component directly lifted from the iPhone 13 Pro. The ultra-wide camera is also the same as in the 13 (12MP), but it benefits from Apple's Photonic Engine. The TL;DR? iPhone 14 in yellow has similar hardware to the 13 range, but better software. Here's how that looks in pics.\n\nFor a look at how the iPhone 14 compares to the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max camera, head over here. And here if you want to compare the iPhone 14 to the Google equivalent - the Google Pixel 7.\n\nThere are so many songs with the word 'yellow' in them, it was really hard to keep this from being just one big music reference, but that's really the big thing here - that the phone now comes in yellow. The yellow matches my aesthetic more, yes, but I'm not genuinely just basing my entire opinion on the colouring - I could always get a yellow case if I really wanted, after all. But bringing out the yellow option gave me another chance to use the iPhone 14 and six months later, I've warmed up to it.\n\nThe iPhone 14 will give you all-day battery life. On every device we can (laptop, phone), we do the Avengers: Endgame test. That is, we stream the 3-hour movie from Disney+ on the highest quality, brightness all the way up and volume at max. We see how much this drains the battery. Halfway through the movie, the battery was down to 81 per cent and by the end of the three hours, it was at 54 per cent. The iPhone 14 Pro Max still had 63 per cent at the end of the flick. Apple reckons you'll get up to 20 hours of video playback (up to 16 hours streamed) out of the battery.\n\nThe camera system also isn't terrible.\n\nThe iPhone 14, now in yellow, has access to all the fantastic stuff Apple crams into its operating system and, look. It's a great phone. Just like the other colours in the iPhone 14 range are. The yellow is just the icing on the cake.",

                    "body": "Apple usually reserves at least one colour option for its iPhone devices, which it unveils mid-season (5-6 months before the launch of its next lineup). Following the tradition, the brand has now launched an all-new Yellow colour variant of its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus devices.\n\nThe new Yellow colour for the iPhone 14 devices joins an already extensive list of paint jobs available (midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT) RED, blue, and purple) and will soon start selling in the market. The Pro models, however, have not been provided with the same treatment, and it looks like Apple might not be releasing a new colour option for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max devices anytime soon. Nevertheless, let's take a look at the new Yellow colour variant of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus devices.\n\nAs seen in the image above, this is what the new Yellow colour option for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus devices looks like. The new Yellow colour iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus devices retain the usual pricing, and will sell for a starting price of Rs 79,900 and Rs 89,900, respectively.\n\nInterested buyers will be able to pre-order the new colour option in India and other countries starting tomorrow, i.e March 10th, 2023. The devices will be available starting March 14th, 2023.\n\nPeople love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone. - Bob Borchers, Apple's Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing\n\nPlus, as far as accessories are concerned, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus will now have four new official covers - canary yellow, olive, sky, and iris.",

One of them even states that \"nobody will buy this banana looking iPhone.\"\n\nEvery first quarter of the year, Apple tends to release new colours for their baseline and pro iPhones. This year, the rumours are that there is a new colour option. What's more, it will be in yellowish-gold; not similar to the gold colour option that is already available on the pro models.\n\nAccording to MacRumors, the potential unveiling of a fresh colour variant for the iPhone 14 will be made public through a press release on the Apple Newsroom website this week. It will be coinciding with the possible launch of new iPhone cases and Apple Watch band colours for the upcoming spring season.\n\nApple introduced a brand-new Green hue for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini on March 8, 2022. Furthermore, an Alpine Green shade was released for the iPhone 13 Pro models. It is speculated that this is the midpoint of the current iPhone cycle and that releasing a new colour may generate more sales.\n\nOn Twitter, netizens are discussing the new colour, but they are not too excited about it. One of them states that \"nobody will buy this banana looking iPhone.\"\n\nBesides, many are waiting for a potential new colour for the Pro models as the Alpine Green shade is still quite popular even today. Those who are waiting for a new colour will most likely have to wait until the next cycle of iPhones coming out this year.\n\nThere are also some rumours out there speculating that a dark red colour option will be available for the next iPhones. Many are excited about this option as it looks elegant and sophisticated by judging the renders made.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple users are complaining that the current iPhone design is stale and boring. Netizens are citing that people will confuse the older iPhones with the newer ones as they look similar.\n\nRead More News",

It also specified that Sony's solution will bring improved performance and power efficiency compared to competing suppliers.\n\nThe record doesn't provide clues that the iPhone-maker is adopting the LiDAR (laser imaging, detection, and ranging) for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. If to materialize, the lower-end shooters would only be getting a rumored 48MP rear camera and not along with the laser-based feature.\n\nIntroduced with the iPhone 12 Pro, TOF 3D LiDAR is coupled to the rear cameras. This component projects a laser light, invisible to the naked eye, to determine accurate distance or depth of the subjects. Subsequently, it allows the camera to easily focus on subjects even in low light scenarios. This also gives a more distinctive bokeh or blur effect.\n\nIn a separate case, tipster yeux1122 took is forecasting on Korean platform Naver that the LTPO panels with 120Hz refresh will be exclusive for the iPhone 15 Pro (Max). Meaning, the iPhone 15 (Plus) would boast Dynamic Island display, but the refresh rate will be limited to 60Hz and lack always-on display feature.\n\nThe news is not surprising at all given that some sources previously detailed the same claim. More importantly, it would only be logical for Apple to toned-down the regular iPhones and avoid cannibalizing the sales of the more expensive models.",

As the new color will be available to order this Friday, we now want to know your thoughts on the yellow color.\n\nThe new yellow color will be available for both iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. \"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing.\n\nExcept for the color, the yellow iPhone 14 has exactly the same specifications as the other models released last year. This includes the glass and aluminum design, dual rear camera module with 12-megapixel lenses, new front-facing camera with autofocus, A15 Bionic chip with improved graphics, Crash Detection, and Emergency SOS via satellite.\n\nIn the past, Apple has also introduced new colors for the current generation iPhone in an attempt to boost sales after the holiday season. Last year, both iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro got a new green option in the lineup. This year, however, the new color is exclusive to the regular iPhone 14 models.\n\nWe recently ran a poll on 9to5Mac to find out what new color our readers want to see for the iPhone 15 Pro. That's because our sources have revealed to us that this year's Pro models will be available in a dark red. In addition, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are expected to have new shades of blue and pink.\n\nBut what about the yellow iPhone 14? Do you like the new color? Do you intend to buy the new model? Let us know your thoughts in the poll and also in the comments section below.",

                    "body": "In this bootstrap economy, knowing how to capture professional pictures and videos of your listings could save you thousands in marketing expenses. Marketing expert Latham Jenkins shares his pro tips for using your iPhone to capture stunning, high-quality footage.\n\nIn March's Marketing and Branding Month, we'll go deep on agent branding and best practices for spending with Zillow, Realtor.com and more. Top CMOs of leading firms drop by to share their newest tactics, too. And to top off this theme month, Inman is debuting a brand new set of awards for branding and marketing leaders in the industry called Marketing All-Stars.\n\nThe best camera is always the one you know how to use, and even as a professional photographer, I default to my iPhone. Admittedly, I upgrade with each new model to take advantage of the camera and video improvements, which render great photos and video of my multimillion-dollar listings.\n\nThe iPhone is rather idiot-proof; if you can hold it level and steady you'd be hard-pressed not to capture good-looking footage with little technical knowledge and creative talent. That's all the more reason to stay away from thinking you need a professional 35mm camera with lots of lenses. Here's how I use my iPhone to take premium video and photos.\n\nWhen using my iPhone to capture a listing, I mount it on my gimbal. I use the DJI 0M 5 Smartphone Gimbal Stabilizer, one of many options. The gimbal helps to shoot level photos and not shake the camera when I push the shutter button. For video, just slowly move it around the room and it creates a more fluid video capture without giving the viewer motion sickness.\n\nI utilize my iPhone because of the HDR (high dynamic range) feature, which in essence, helps to blend and balance the really bright light with the dark shadows. This is needed with interiors as you'll have bright windows and dark shadowed areas within any scene.\n\nBefore I shoot anything, I make a plan of what I want to show in both photos and in the video. This way, you don't end up with unnecessary footage to deal with when editing, and you can speed up your workflow so you can get your listing on the MLS.\n\nOne of the many great things about using the iPhone is that you can immediately see what you have shot. If you don't like it, erase it, and shoot it again, so you don't get confused about which clips are your best to use in the forthcoming edit.\n\nOnce I finish with my shoot, I use the free tools in the Apple software, Photos, to edit my photos and iMovie for my video edits. Working within the Apple ecosystem between the iPhone to capture and these two programs keeps everything simple and intuitive.\n\nLastly, I like to upload and utilize YouTube as my video platform. It is the most search engine-friendly so your video is likely to be found and viewed outside of just marketing it within your listing promotions.",

Apple's crown jewel, the iPhone 14 Pro Max, is considered to be one of those, and one of the most popular high-end phones generally. Therefore, we're here to compare the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max vs Xiaomi 13 Pro. These two phones do differ in so many ways, and that should make for an interesting comparison.\n\nWe'll first list their spec sheets, as we usually do when it comes to comparisons. Following that, we'll compare the two devices across a number of categories, including design, display, performance, battery, cameras, and audio. This will, hopefully, help you make a purchasing decision. So, let's get started.\n\nThe Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and Xiaomi 13 Pro sure do look different, and also feel different in the hand. The iPhone 14 Pro Max has flat sides, all of them. That includes its display too. The phone is made out of stainless steel and glass. The Xiaomi 13 Pro has a lot of curves, on the other hand. Even its display is slightly curved towards the sides. The device is made out of aluminum and ceramic, at least the global model is.\n\nApple's flagship is slightly shorter, but noticeably wider than the Xiaomi 13 Pro. It is also slightly thinner in comparison. It weighs 240 grams, while the Xiaomi 13 Pro weighs 229 grams (ceramic model). We'll refer to the ceramic model throughout this comparison, as that is the only variant that launched globally. The iPhone 14 Pro Max has uniform bezels, and a pill-shaped cutout on the front. The Xiaomi 13 Pro has extremely thin bezels, and a centered display camera hole.\n\nIf we flip the two phones around, you'll see considerably different designs on the back. Both of them have display camera islands in the top-left corner, but they do look fairly different. Both phones do include three cameras on the back, though. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is a bit more annoying to use with one hand due to its width, and the fact it cuts into your hand due to its flat bottom and weight. The Xiaomi 13 Pro is not easy to use with one hand either, as it's also quite large. Both phones are quite slippery, so the usage of a case is recommended.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max includes a 6.7-inch 2796 x 1290 LTPO Super Retina XDR OLED display. This panel is flat, and it supports an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. It supports HDR10 content, and also has Dolby Vision support. It can reach a maximum brightness of 2,000 nits in direct sunlight. The display aspect ratio here is 19.5:9, and the panel is protected by the Ceramic Shield glass.\n\nThe Xiaomi 13 Pro, on the other hand, has a 6.73-inch QHD+ (3200 x 1440) LTPO AMOLED display. This display is curved, and it supports up to 1 billion colors. It has an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz, and Dolby Vision support as well. This panel also gets immensely bright at 1,900 nits of peak brightness. The display aspect ratio here is 20:9, and the panel is protected by the Gorilla Glass Victus.\n\nBoth of these phones have top-of-the-line displays. They're immensely sharp, vivid, and have great viewing angles. On top of that, they're really fluid, and get more than bright enough. Even in direct sunlight, both displays should get bright enough for you to be able to easily see what's on them. These are some of the brightest offerings out there. They're both also well-protected. You can't go wrong here, just note that one is flat, and the other is curved.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max is fueled by the Apple A16 Bionic SoC. That is Apple's 4nm flagship processor. The phone is also equipped with 6GB of RAM, and NVMe storage. The Xiaomi 13 Pro comes with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, the best processor Qualcomm has to offer. The phone is equipped with 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 flash storage. Xiaomi's flagship has more powerful RAM and storage, while both SoCs are outstanding.\n\nWhat does this mean for regular, day-to-day performance. It means that you'll get an immensely fluid phone, regardless of what you do, basically. Getting them to slow down is not an easy task. They glide through browsing, consuming multimedia, image editing, messaging, and so much more. Even games are not a problem for either of the two phones, which is to be expected. Even the most powerful games out there run very nicely on both smartphones. They do get warm during intense gaming sessions, but we did not notice a performance drop-off or anything of the sort.\n\nApple's flagship comes with a 4,323mAh battery, while the Xiaomi 13 Pro has a 4,820mAh unit. Do note that iOS devices usually come with smaller batteries, but that doesn't mean they offer worse battery life. What's the case here, though? Well, both smartphones offer excellent battery life, but the iPhone 14 Pro Max does have the edge. Apple improved its battery life since its launch, actually.\n\nGetting to an 8-hour screen-on-time mark with both phones is doable, while the iPhone 14 Pro Max usually lasts a bit longer than that. The Xiaomi 13 Pro sometimes fell under that mark for us, though. Your mileage will, of course, differ, maybe even considerably. Your installed apps will be different, and so will your usage and signal where you live. There are simply too many factors. The point is, both phones deliver really good battery life.\n\nWhen it comes to charging, the Xiaomi 13 Pro dwarfs the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Not only does it come with a 120W charger in the box, but it supports 120W wired charging. It also supports 50W wireless charging, and 10W reverse wireless charging. The iPhone 14 Pro Max doesn't have a charger in the box, and it supports 20W wired, 15W MagSafe wireless, and 7.5W Qi wireless charging.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max has a 48-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide unit (120-degree FoV), and a 12-megapixel telephoto camera (3x optical zoom). The Xiaomi 13 Pro, on the other hand, comes with a 50.3-megapixel main camera (1-inch sensor), a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera (115-degree FoV), and a 50-megapixel telephoto camera (3.2x optical zoom). Xiaomi's flagship also has Leica lenses on all three cameras.\n\nSo, how do they compare? Well, they both shoot great photos, but completely different ones. The iPhone 14 Pro Max tries to keep things closer to real life in terms of looks. The Xiaomi 13 Pro has that Leica image style and two shooting styles you can choose from. It offers Leica Vibrant and Leica Authentic modes. The Leica Vibrant is what most people will prefer, as the colors get emphasized a bit more.\n\nThey both provide really detailed photos, though the ones from the Xiaomi 13 Pro look a bit more moody, in lack of a better word. That especially goes for low light images. They also look more like they were taken with professional cameras due to the natural, creamy bokeh. The dynamic range is good on both, but they both struggle with white balance from time to time. It could end up being fixed soon, though, via an update. They both do a great job with macro photography, while the Xiaomi 13 Pro shines when it comes to portrait images taken with the telephoto camera.\n\nBoth phones do a good job when it comes to ultrawide shots, and they keep the color science close to what the main cameras offer. The video recording is better on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, but the Xiaomi 13 Pro does a great job too. It's all a matter of preference when it comes to these cameras, both phones do a great job.\n\nThere is a pair of stereo speakers on both of these smartphones. Those speakers are very good on both phones. They're more than loud enough, and they're also detailed. The distortion is not exactly noticeable.\n\nThere is no audio jack on either phone, though. You'll need to utilize the Type-C port, which is located at the bottom of both phones. If you prefer a wireless connection, however, Bluetooth 5.3 is on offer on both devices.",

Laptop Mag Editor-in-Chief Sherri L. Smith, for example, says she'd be more receptive to the yellow iPhone 14 if Apple released a pair of lemony AirPods, too.\n\nUnfortunately, the Cupertino-based tech giant did no such thing. However, thanks to third-party vendors, we can still spice up our iDevices with the bright, sunny colors Apple is reluctant to roll out. Below, you can find 5 of the best accessories to complement the new yellow iPhone 14, allowing you to strut around in tech-influenced style that stops traffic, or at least makes it proceed with caution.",

                    "body": "Apple introduced a brand new color for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus and this guide will take you through the most important things to know about the yellow iPhone 14.\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 is a bright addition to the Apple's lineup and it's certainly worth a look if you want your device to stand out from the pack.\n\nIf you're interested in Apple's vibrant iPhone, here's what you need to know about the yellow iPhone 14's price, pre-order, release date, and deals.\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus aren't on sale yet, but they will go up for pre-order at Apple, carriers, and various retailers starting on Friday, March 10th.\n\nCustomers in located Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., the U.S., and more than 60 other countries and regions will be able to pre-order yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus starting at 5AM Pacific.\n\nApple has seemingly gotten its supply chain under control so we may not see shipping dates get pushed back immediately. That said, if you want a new yellow iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus on your doorstep ASAP, you may want to wake up early/stay up late to put in your order soon after pre-orders begin.\n\nThe pre-order period will extend through the weekend culminating with the devices release date on Tuesday, March 14th. This is the date when you'll be able to walk into your carrier store or a retailer and walk out with a yellow iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nWe don't know how much stock each store will have on hand so if you're nervous about coming away empty-handed, you'll want to put in a pre-order.\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, like their counterparts in other hues, will be available in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities. The iPhone 14 starts at $799 while the iPhone 14 Plus starts at $899.\n\nIf you need more information about iPhone 14 storage options, we've got you covered.\n\nApple and its partners will offer trade-in deals to customers looking to snag a yellow iPhone 14 Plus or iPhone 14.\n\nCustomers who buy through Apple can get $200 to $600 in credit when trading in an iPhone 11 or later. If you want the most money back the phone needs to be in pristine condition.\n\nBuyers can also get up to $800 credit on iPhone 14 after trade-in directly from Apple when activating it on select carriers in the United States.\n\nCarriers and retailers will have trade-in offers of their own so make sure you shop around before you settle on a place to buy your new device.\n\nUnfortunately, the yellow color is exclusive to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. There more than likely won't be a yellow iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max and we may not see Apple releases any new colors for the higher-end models.",

                    "title": "The iPhone 15 Isn't Getting an Always-On Display | Here's Why",
                    "body": "If you've been hoping that this year's iPhone 15 would feature significantly better display technology, you might want to temper your expectations, as it appears Apple will still be reserving its best screens for its Pro lineup.\n\nWhile there's some strong evidence that this year's iPhone 15 lineup will gain the Dynamic Island from the iPhone 14 Pro, it seems that may be the only significant screen difference in this year's standard model.\n\nAccording to a display industry source cited by South Korean leaker yeux11222, Apple is already preparing for mass production of the iPhone 15 lineup. Therefore it's already been receiving the display panels from suppliers -- and none of those panels support the LTPO 120Hz refresh rate required to support an Always-On Display.\n\nIn some ways, this shouldn't be a huge surprise since Apple has done the same thing with its iPad lineup for years; only the flagship iPad Pro gets the 120Hz ProMotion displays. The same also holds true for Apple's MacBooks. There seems to be a correlation here between \"Pro\" and \"ProMotion.\"\n\nAlthough hope reigns supreme, the consensus among analysts has long been that Apple's 120Hz \"ProMotion\" displays will continue to be limited to the iPhone Pro models, at least for the foreseeable future.\n\nSome folks had hoped that Apple might find a way to bring the always-on display technology to the iPhone 15 despite this limitation. However, the variable refresh rate LTPO displays that Apple uses for its iPhone 14 Pro are an intrinsic requirement for an always-on display. You can't have one without the other -- at least not in any way that makes sense.\n\nA display's refresh rate is a measurement of how often the information on the display gets updated. This is why 120Hz displays offer smoother scrolling and motion than the more common 60Hz displays. However, the important thing about Apple's ProMotion displays is that they can also go the other way, lowering the refresh rate below 60Hz when the display doesn't need to be updated as often.\n\nThis is an important feature, as higher refresh rates consume more power. We saw a great example of this with the iPhone 13 Pro, where the lower refresh rate more than doubled the battery life for watching videos -- up to 25 hours on the iPhone 13 Pro Max compared to only 12 on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.\n\nThis is a direct result of the iPhone 13 Pro's ability to lower the refresh rate as needed. Since most streaming video is recorded at either 24 or 30 frames per second (fps), there's no need for the display to refresh at 60Hz -- twice the frame rate of the video being shown. Instead, the iPhone can ramp the refresh rate down to 24Hz or 30Hz, which uses half the battery life.\n\nThe same logic applies to supporting an always-on display. For the display on the iPhone 14 Pro to remain on without consuming a ridiculous amount of battery power, it needs to be able to lower the refresh rate to the bare minimum of 1Hz. At that rate, the iPhone 14 Pro only updates the screen once per second, which is more than often enough when you're not actively using it.\n\nOne of the reasons the iPhone 13 Pro didn't get an always-on display is that the screens on those models bottomed out at 10Hz, which still would have used ten times more battery power than the display on the iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nWhile Apple could theoretically cook up a more basic always-on display, similar to what was done on early Android phones, it's fair to say that's not the company's style. Apple wanted to do it right, and it's hard to argue the company didn't accomplish that in a big way.\n\nWhile always-on displays have been widely available on Android handsets since 2017, those early monochromatic versions don't hold a candle to what Apple accomplished with the iPhone 14 Pro. Apple took its time to create a significantly more advanced always-on display that not only shows a dimmed version of your Lock Screen in full colour but even does tone mapping to ensure the colours remain accurate with the lower illumination.\n\nApple isn't about to compromise on the elegance of that design merely to check off a box on the iPhone 15's spec sheet any more than it would have settled for a lesser-quality always-on display three years ago. As technology marches on, it's probably inevitable that all iPhone models will eventually get variable refresh rates and always-on displays, but for now, it looks like Apple will continue to make this an exclusive feature of the iPhone 15 Pro lineup.\n\n[The information provided in this article has NOT been confirmed by Apple and may be speculation.

                    "body": "The yellow iPhone 14 was just unveiled by Apple. Of course, many users are excited about the new color variant.\n\nHowever, some tech enthusiasts are concerned that the arrival of the new yellow iPhone 14 could mean that the Apple Spring Event 2023 would be canceled.\n\nExperts explained that the Spring Event doesn't really happen every year. There were already some instances when this tech conference didn't take place, such as in 2020.\n\nAccording to MacWorld's latest report, if Apple really plans to continue its Spring Event 2023, then it would have waited for it to happen before announcing the yellow iPhone 14.\n\nAlso Read: Apple to Release New iPhone 14 Color this Spring, Analyst Confirms It is Like Last Year\n\nBut, some tech critics believe that the new color variant could have been unveiled so that Apple can trick enthusiasts that there won't be an event.\n\nAs of writing, the rumored cancellation is still based on the recent pattern of Apple when it comes to launching its Spring Event.\n\nOne of the reasons why consumers should be worried about the alleged Spring Event cancellation is the delayed launch of the next-gen MacBook Air.\n\nThis means that if there's no Apple Spring Event, then there will also be no new MacBook Air in April.\n\nSome rumors claimed that the Apple Spring Event 2023 will happen in April. Meanwhile, others believe the iPhone maker will launch the event in late March.\n\nIn this event, the iPhone maker will unveil new exciting products, such as the new 15.5-inch MacBook Air and 16-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nAside from these, there could also be the new Mac Pro with an M2 Ultra chipset, as well as a high-end Pro Display XDR, as reported by MacRumors.\n\nThis is why many fans are expecting the Apple Spring Event 2023 will take place. While the gadget developer is still preparing for this tech conference, it is also busy with its other products.\n\nRecently, the new 24-inch iMac is reportedly arriving earlier than expected. We also reported about the ultra-thin bezel of the iPhone 15 Pro, which was revealed by a newly leaked front glass panel.\n\nFor more news updates about Apple and its upcoming tech conferences, always keep your tabs open here at TechTimes.",

                    "title": "The smartphone sales figures are in  --  and the iPhone dominates Android",
                    "body": "Grab one of the most popular handsets to go on sale in the past year, and chances are good, it's going to have an Apple logo stamped on the back.\n\nThat's according to Counterpoint Research, which posted its rankings of the best-selling smartphones of 2022 (opens in new tab). The list is essentially a round-up of the best iPhones, as Apple claimed 8 of the 10 spots in Counterpoint's rankings, which cover the global market. That's the first time a single phone maker has done that, according to the market research firm.\n\nThe iPhone 13 claimed the No. 1 slot, with a 5% overall share of the market. The iPhone 13 Pro Max came in second, followed by the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which came out in late 2022 but still managed to grab a 1.7% share.\n\nThe iPhone 13 lineup had an advantage over many other devices that landed in Counterpoint's Top 10. Since those phones debuted in October 2021, they were on sale for the entirety of 2022. A price cut to the iPhone 13 following the iPhone 14's launch in September 2022 likely helped boos sales in what Counterpoint Research calls developing markets.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max's top 3 finish is also noteworthy, as Counterpoint says it's the first time the Pro Max version of Apple's phone enjoyed greater sales than the Pro and standard variations. In comparing the iPhone 14 vs. the iPhone 14 Pro, it's clear Apple loaded up its Pro models with more significant features, most notably improved cameras and faster processors. That's clearly motivated shoppers to pay up for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, with the Pro Max's larger screen likely adding to that model's appeal.\n\nOnly two non-Apple phones landed in the Top 10 of 2022 smartphone sales, and both belong to Samsung. The Galaxy A13 landed at the fourth spot on Counterpoint's list, while the Galaxy A03 closed out the Top 10. Both are budget devices -- Samsung sells the Galaxy A13 5G for $215, while the Galaxy A03 hover around the $100 mark -- with Samsung's flagships and high-priced foldables missing out on the top 10.\n\nAndroid phones still make up the vast majority of devices that get sold around the world, with Statista claiming Android enjoyed a 71.7% market share (opens in new tab) to iOS's 27.6% share at the end of the fourth quarter in 2022. Nevertheless, individual iPhone models seem to enjoy greater popularity. Apart from customer loyalty and preference for one mobile OS over the other, we'd imagine the factors driving sales toward individual iPhone models include their performance, design and reputation for being among the best camera phones.\n\nLooking closer at the Counterpoint Research numbers, we can make a few interesting observations about the handsets that landed in the Top 10 for global phone sales as well as those that missed the cut.\n\nWe mentioned that the only Android phones to make the top 10 cost less than $220. But iPhone enthusiasts seemingly like a good bargain, too. The iPhone SE 20202, which costs $429, landed in the top 10 for smartphone sales, where it was joined by the iPhone 12. That latter model may have debuted back in 2020, but a series of price cuts have kept the device around as a low-cost alternative to more recent iPhones.\n\nFlagship devices are certainly exciting, but they're not the only phones that people are snapping up. There's a growing interest in midrange and budget models, and you're seeing that reflected in the devices smartphone makers are putting out. It's why we're eager to see what Samsung and Google have planned for the Galaxy A54 and Pixel 7a, respectively, with both phones expected to debut in the coming months at Google I/O 2023.\n\nYou can forgive the Galaxy S23's absence from the Counterpoint Research list, since it's only looking at phones that were on sale in 2022 and the latest Samsung flagships only came out last month. But not a single Galaxy S22 model landed in the top 10 despite those phones being on sale since February 2022. What gives?\n\nIf we had to guess, we'd assume that the absence is explained by the Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22 Plus being modest upgrades over recent Galaxy S models. If you had bought a Samsung flagship within the last two years or so, there was little in those two S22 offerings to tempt you to upgrade. The bigger features were reserved for the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which, at $1,199, remains Samsung's most expensive phone outside of the Galaxy Z Fold 4.\n\nA high cost isn't enough to stop people from buying your phone, as the iPhone 14 Pro Max's high ranking proves. But clearly shoppers found that phone more compelling than the S22 Ultra. It will be interesting to see if the same fate befalls the Galaxy S23 Ultra and its 200MP main camera a year from now when the 2023 global sales figures become available.\n\nWhile you'll find a lot of iPhones in that Top 10 list, you won't see the iPhone 14 Plus -- the only iPhone 14 model not to crack the Top 10. You could argue that the iPhone 14 Plus didn't have that big a sales window -- it shipped a few weeks after the rest of Apple's fall phone releases -- but the iPhone 13 mini was on sale the whole year, and it didn't make the list either. In fact, it was the only iPhone 13 model not to do so.\n\nThat's two iPhone release cycles where four models proved to be one iPhone too many. That would seem more evidence to back the argument that Apple should drop that fourth model -- be it plus-sized or mini -- and concentrate solely on the standard, Pro and Pro Max sizes that have proven more popular.\n\nBased on iPhone 15 rumors, though, it's unlikely to happen. Most observers expect Apple to release four new models this fall, with an iPhone 15 Plus remaining in the lineup alongside the standard iPhone and the two iPhone 15 Pro models.\n\nWith Apple and Samsung making up the entire top 10 of phone sales for the past year, it's more clear than ever that those two companies are the dominant players in the phone market and everyone else is just fighting for scraps. It's a question we asked before when wondering why Google's Pixel phones aren't more popular, despite the improvements Google's made with the Pixel 7.\n\nSome of it comes down to availability -- phones like the Pixel haven't been marketed in as many places in the past as devices from Apple and Samsung -- and some of it's a matter of focus. (Motorola does a respectable business with its low-cost Moto G series, but there are so many different variations, it's harder for a single model to break through.) Whatever the case, it appears to be a Samsung and Apple World -- and more Apple than Samsung, according to the numbers -- and the rest of us are just living in it.",

We have previously heard that the company is looking to adopt a solid-state approach for the Volume and Power buttons along with the Mute switch. However, the company is also planning to implement a wide range of changes that will impact usability. According to the latest, the iPhone 15 Pro models will come with efficient LiDAR scanners, ultimately contributing to enhanced battery life.\n\nIf you are not following the latest in terms of Apple's forthcoming 'Pro' handsets, the company is planning to change one of the key design elements. The iPhone 15 Pro models will ditch the current Volume button mechanism in favor of solid-state buttons with three Taptic Engines inside the chassis of the device. Additionally, the device will be powered by an A17 Bionic chip which will be fabricated on TSMC's 3nm process. Performance gains aside, the iPhone 15 Pro models will feature improved battery life due to the less power-hungry nature of the chip.\n\nAccording to Blayne Curtis and Tom O'Malley from Barclays, Sony will act as the main supplier of LiDAR Scanner equipment to Apple. This is not the first time that we are hearing details on Sony scoring the majority of sensor modules as analyst Ming-Chi Kuo highlighted the switch back in February. To be precise, Sony would supply the sensor module, VSCEL, receiver, and driver.\n\nThere is a reason why Apple is moving away from Lumentum and WIN Semiconductors and it has everything to do with the efficiency and performance of the scanner. Sony's iteration of the sensor will be less power-hungry and provides enhanced performance. Another scenario is that the sensor could offer the same results but contribute to better battery on the iPhone 15 Pro models.\n\nConjoined with the A17 Bionic chip, the LiDAR scanner on the iPhone 15 Pro will contribute to better battery life than the current models. We have also previously heard that Apple is looking to use its in-house 5G modems which are also slated to consume less power and deliver enhanced connectivity. However, it is not clear if Apple will move ahead with its custom modems or use Qualcomm's.\n\nAll in all, low power-consuming components in the iPhone 15 Pro will add to the battery life and Apple will keep striding for better with future iterations. We will keep you updated with the latest, so be sure to stick around.",

In comparison, vase-level, but still high-end Android devices, including, most notably, the Galaxy S23 and Pixel 7, offer 120Hz and 90Hz display refresh rates, respectively, and have done so for years.\n\nThis means that once again, only Apple's high-end iPhone models -- rumoured to be called the iPhone 15 Pro and, possibly, the iPhone 15 Ultra -- will feature a 120Hz refresh rate.\n\nWhile this isn't entirely surprising, given Apple always keeps some features exclusive to its higher-end devices, it's still disappointing to see the tech giant so far behind its key Android competitors regarding the display technology featured in its base-level devices.\n\nApple will likely reveal the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus this coming fall. The tech giant recently revealed a new 'Yellow' iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.",

                    "title": "Announcements Hidden in the Big Yellow iPhone Announcement",
                    "body": "A bright yellow phone from Apple, planned expansion for a couple of Apple services, and you will not believe how big iPhone was last year.\n\nA big announcement from Apple, with more important announcements folded in. As had been rumored/speculated, Apple did add a new yellow hue to the iPhone 14 line. That's a yellow iPhone 14 and a yellow iPhone 14 Plus. Meanwhile, for the Pro line -- a whole lotta nothin. One wants to cut that line some slack though. A couple of months ago, you pretty much couldn't get an iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max.\n\nThe new, bright color joins the current lineup of midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, and purple. It comes in at the same capacities and prices as the rest -- $799 to start for iPhone 14 and $899 for iPhone 14 Plus. Folks in \"Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., the U.S., and more than 60 other countries and regions\" can order the yellow phone beginning Friday, March 10 at 5 a.m. Pacific. Quick turnaround on this one. The new hue should be available beginning Tuesday, March 14.\n\nI said that the announcement had more important announcements folded in. The release for the new color basically served as a chance to reintroduce various iPhone 14 features, including the device's dual-camera system, better battery life, the Ceramic Shield front cover, and more. Buried in the reintroduction, the expansion of one potentially life saving feature. Reintroducing Emergency SOS via satellite, the company said more countries will be getting the service this month. In case you've forgotten, Apple says:\n\nEmergency SOS via satellite allows users to message with emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available through a combination of custom-designed components and deeply integrated software. Additionally, if users want to reassure friends and family of their whereabouts while off the grid, they can open the Find My app and share their location via satellite.\n\nAlready available in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the U.K., and the U.S., Apple's press release says the service is on the way to Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Emergency SOS via satellite will go live for those countries \"later this month.\"\n\nThere was one more buried announcement that's not as dramatic as the SOS thing, but could prove important to Apple's business. Well, announcement might be a strong word. According to a piece from 9to5Mac Apple has acknowledged the imminent launch of Apple Pay in South Korea. Oh, not in any press release you're likely to have read. The report quotes the Korean version of the yellow iPhone press release saying:\n\n...as Apple is about to launch Apple Pay in South Korea, Korean users will be able to make easy, fast, and secure payments using Apple Pay on their iPhone, including the new iPhone Yellow, and in on-line merchants and apps.\n\nIn years past, Apple's spring color refresh announcements have been accompanied by new accessories. This year is no exception. A piece from MacRumors says silicone cases in four new colors are on the way. The Canary Yellow, Iris, Olive, and Sky offerings will be for all four of iPhone's current models -- 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, and 14 Pro Max. They will beat the yellow phones to market. Available to oder now, MacRumors says the new colored cases will start wrapping themselves around phones in the 14 line tomorrow -- Thursday, March 9.\n\nOf course, iPhone cases are not the only accessories Apple has to offer. A piece from 9to5Mac says Apple Watch got a bit of love on Tuesday. The piece says the \"Solo Loop, Braided Solo Loop, Sport Band, and Herm\u00e8s bands have a range of new finishes available.\" New colors include:\n\nCult of Mac actually had a funny write-up of the Herm\u00e8s offerings. Suffice to say they were not impressed.\n\nAll of the new bands are available to order today. They'll be wrapping themselves around wrists starting tomorrow -- Thursday, March 9.\n\nYou can officially call smartphone sales a two-horse race as far as Counterpoint Research is concerned, though one horse is running away with it. In a release issued Tuesday, the market tracker said that iPhone took eight of the top-ten best-selling smartphone spots on the planet in 2022. The other two were made by Samsung.\n\nSurprises from the release:\n\nUpdates on Tuesday for developers and musicians. For the developers -- a new round of betas. AppleInsider posted a couple of pertinent pieces on Tuesday. One pointed out that the third betas of iOS/iPadOS/tvOS 16.4 as well as watchOS 9.4 were available to developers. The other said the same for the third beta of macOS Ventura 13.3 for developers.\n\nAs for the musicians -- if you're a GarageBandian, there's a security update for you. Another piece from AppleInsider says the Cupertino-company released GarageBand 10.4.8 for the Mac on Tuesday. While we know it's security focused, that focus is a bit blurry. Apple's release notes simply say the \"update provides important security fixes and is recommended for all users,\" according to the report.\n\nIt's awards season here, there, and everywhere. While we in the States tend to think of awards as a Hollywood thing, the U.K. and Europe like doling out trophies as well. A couple of pieces from AppleInsider have a few Apple TV+ titles up for a few awards in the UK and Ireland.\n\nIn the U.K., the site says the series \"Slow Horses\" and \"Bad Sisters\" are up for a Royal Television Society Programme Award. Yes, just one -- the two titles are competing in the \"Writer -- Drama\" category. Sharon Horgan is up for \"Bad Sisters,\" while Will Smith (not that one) is up for the spy drama.\n\nMaking the hop over to Ireland, we find the Irish drama \"Bad Sisters\" nominated 12 times in the Irish Film & TV Awards. That's four nominations for Supporting Actress -- Drama, three for Supporting Actor -- Drama, one for Lead Actress -- Drama, one for Best Director -- Drama, one for Best Script -- Drama, one for Production Design, and one for Best Drama.\n\nSo much drama.\n\nApple TV+ did pick up one other nomination. According to the second AppleInsider piece, Aoife McArdle has also been nominated for Best Director -- Drama for the mind-bending workplace drama \"Severance.\"\n\nAnd finally today, the Apple TV+ musical comedy \"Schmigadoon!\" is back soon for season two -- and it's bringing \"the old razzle dazzle.\" Apple TV+ issued a press release Tuesday, outlining the season and bringing a trailer. As had been teased before, the return to Schmigadoon, referred to in the show as \"Schmicago,\" updates its tone by a decade or two in a \"reimagined world of '60s and '70s musicals.\"\n\nCecily Strong and Keegan-Michael Key return as the leads. They'll be joined by Tituss Burgess, Dove Cameron, Kristin Chenoweth, Alan Cumming, Ariana DeBose, Jane Krakowski, and many more. Wednesday is for lighter fare, it seems. The first two episodes of season two hit Apple TV+ on Wednesday, April 5. The remaining four will follow on successive Wednesdays through the second season conclusion on Wednesday, May 3. While you wait, you can catch the trailer on YouTube.\n\nTMO Managing Editor Jeff Butts and I will look at Apple's new iPhone offerings, as well as that Counterpoint iPhone count. Plus: We're taking a trip to the \"Lassoverse.\" That's all today on the Daily Observations Podcast from The Mac Observer.",

                    "body": "Apple captured eight spots in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones for 2022, according to a market-research firm. The three most popular models all run iOS.\n\nBut Samsung's flagship Android is at least in the top 10, right? Nope.\n\nWhen looking at total numbers, Android outsells iPhone. But sales of handsets running Google's OS are split among so many companies that no Android sells enough to really compete with the popularity of individual iPhone models.\n\n\"Apple's iPhone 13 was the best-selling smartphone of 2022, contributing 28% of iPhone sales,\" reported Harshit Rastogi, an analyst with Counterpoint Research. \"It was the best-selling smartphone in major markets such as China, US, UK, Germany and France.\"\n\nThere was a significant gap between first and second place. \"iPhone 13 sales were two times more than that of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the second best-selling smartphone in 2022,\" according to Rastogi.\n\nIn third place in the most popular handsets among global buyers in 2022 was the iPhone 14 Pro Max, indicating a change in buying habits. The model didn't debut until September but quickly outstripped other phones. \"It was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October and November of 2022,\" noted Rastogi, which means it outsold all the other iPhone 14 variants.\n\nOther Apple models also on Counterpoint Research's top 10 list are the iPhone 13 Pro (5), iPhone 12 (6), iPhone 14 (7), iPhone 14 Pro (8) and iPhone SE 2022 (9).\n\nApple is the first brand to capture eight spots in Counterpoint's list of top 10 best-selling smartphones, leaving space for Samsung to slip in a couple of Androids.\n\nNeither is one of the Korean company's flagship S22 series released in 2022. Instead, they were a pair of entry-level devices: the Galaxy A13 and Galaxy A03. These are so basic they don't have 5G.\n\nOther research has already shown that high-end Androids don't sell particularly well. Not in comparison to iPhone. In the $400-and-up range, iPhone outsells Android almost two-to-one.\n\nThe Android vs. iPhone battle matters for more than bragging rights. Third-party app developers decide which platform to support based on their relative popularity. The same goes for accessory makers.",

At the same time, it is expected that the company will continue to offer various design elements within the same generation in the future. So, the entire iPhone 15 line will receive Dynamic Island, but only the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max (or Ultra, if the name changes) models will receive a display with a higher refresh rate. This technology is called ProMotion, it will provide operation in the frequency range from 1 to 120 Hz.\n\niPhone 15 Pro models will exclusively receive ProMotion and Always-On support, while standard models will remain at 60Hz refresh rate. From the looks of it, Apple wants premium features reserved for the Pro models, but the introduction of Dynamic Island could potentially boost sales.\n\nNote that the basic version of the iPhone 14 is not selling very well, the reason for the low demand for it is the lack of innovation in design. In fact, for this reason, users prefer to buy the iPhone 13 instead of the iPhone 14, because there is almost no difference in appearance, and the price of the iPhone 13 is significantly lower.\n\nAnother reason was the use of the A15 Bionic chip, which minimized the differences between the models. As for the iPhone 15 Pro, this model is expected to receive solid-state buttons instead of mechanical ones, while the volume button may become a single one instead of two separate buttons.",

                    "body": "Apple released its new yellow color for the iPhone 14 yesterday. And it looks great! It's a bright, punchy yellow hue that's much more saturated than some of the other available colors for the iPhone 14.\n\nContents Dark greenGrayMintOrangePurple\n\nBut as much as I love and appreciate the color, it also got me thinking about what else Apple could have done in terms of new iPhone 14 colors. In an alternate reality, what other colors might we have seen for the iPhone 14? With that thought nagging at my brain, I put my crude Photoshop skills to the test to imagine a few other iPhone 14 colors I wish Apple had released instead.\n\nDark green\n\nWhile we don't have a green iPhone 14, Apple was a big fan of the color last year with the iPhone 13 family. In March 2022, the company released two green shades for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro -- including a standard green for the former and a more muted alpine green for the latter.\n\nRelated How the iPhone became the most boring phone you can buy in 2023 The iPhone 14 now comes in this yellow color, and I'm obsessed with it I think I made a huge mistake with my iPhone 14 Pro Max\n\nA dark green iPhone 14 wouldn't look all that different from the green iPhone 13, so I get why Apple didn't go this route. But considering how damn good the green iPhone 13 looked, I wish it had! Apple could have concocted a more saturated green to differentiate the two models just enough while still delivering a green iPhone hue that looks fantastic.\n\nGray\n\nI can hear you right now. \"Of all the colors you could wish for, you chose gray?\" It's a dull-sounding color, I know, but I think it would make for a solid addition to the iPhone 14 color lineup. Black is great for people who want an ultra-stealthy look, while white is a starker, brighter option.\n\nBut what if you want something in between? A matte gray iPhone 14 would fit the bill perfectly. It'd also look excellent paired with a Space Gray M2 MacBook Pro. Call it boring if you want, but I'd be happy to see a gray iPhone 14 join the ranks.\n\nMint\n\nGoing back to something more visually interesting -- can you imagine a mint iPhone 14? It could be a sort of callback to the green color Apple used for the iPhone 11 in 2019, which had a very light, minty hue to it. Now that it's been a few years, it would have been a perfect time to bring it back.\n\nI find that there's something just so calming about a good mint color. It looks refreshing and peaceful, and isn't something we see very often in the smartphone design world. Apple created a great mint color once before, and with the iPhone 14, I wish we had seen it again.\n\nOrange\n\nIn all the years it's been making iPhones, Apple has never released an orange model. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, but I think it's high time Apple changes that. The iPhone 13 was rumored to come in orange, as was the iPhone 14 Pro. But time and time again, it never happens.\n\nAs my quick mock-up shows, an orange iPhone 14 would have looked incredible. It's not as intense as (Product) Red and it's a darker hue than yellow. I think the right approach here would be a bright, saturated orange rather than something dark and muted. We ultimately didn't get that with the iPhone 14, but I certainly wish we had.\n\nPurple\n\nLast but certainly not least, how good would a purple iPhone 14 have looked? The iPhone 14 Pro already comes in the lovely deep purple color, so pairing the iPhone 14 with a similar (but different) purple color of its own would have added some great symmetry between the two models.\n\nIf Apple had gone the purple route, it would have been great to see a punchier, more saturated purple color. The deep purple iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are very dark and subdued -- almost appearing gray in certain lighting conditions. A more intense purple for the iPhone 14 would have been immensely cool to see.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Your Google One plan just got 2 big security updates to keep you safe online Android does this one thing so much better than iOS, and it drives me crazy iPhone 15: release date and price predictions, leaks, rumors, and more I tested the Galaxy S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 Pro cameras.

Let's keep it a buck. It's a device that doesn't scream personalization, but Apple is trying to give its customers a device that speaks for them and stands out.\n\nTuesday, March 7, the company that Jobs built pulled the cover off its new iPhone 14 and 14 Plus model in a bright yellow color. Sorry Pro lovers, you won't be able to partake in this action.\n\nSource: Apple / Yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus\n\nApple dropping a new color for its iPhone around this time of the year is nothing new. Customers in 60 countries, including the US, UK, and Canada, can preorder the device beginning March 10, 8 AM Eastern Time. The phone officially drops on March 14 alongside new colors for the popular silicone case, including a canary yellow version.\n\nThis is not the first time Apple released a device in this color. The 5c. Came in a bright yellow option. The iPhone 11 also had a similar color finish though it was on the paler side. Apple fans could only look forward to the customary Product RED model for the more modern models if they wanted something bold, and that was until now.\n\nAs far as the specs, nothing is changing on that end. Both options still cost $799 and $899.\n\nWell, one thing is for sure: it definitely is lit.\n\nPhoto: Apple / Yellow iPhone 14\n\nRELATED TAGS\n\nApple iphone",

                    "body": "Talk about short-changing your customers, Apple could be omitting two should-be-common-place-by-now display features in the base and Plus iPhone 15 models: no AOD (always-on display) and no variable refresh rates (possibly even locked at 60Hz).\n\nApple appears to be recycling old parts, because -- based on a report on Korean site Naver (citing a \"domestic display industry source\") -- Apple's iPhone 15 and 15 Plus might be retaining the same display tech as the iPhone 14. While the 15 Pro series will get variable display refresh rates (or ProMotion in Apple-parlance), Cupertino might be holding buyers of its lesser models to a fixed 60Hz refresh rate and, more perplexing, no AOD. WTH. SMH.\n\nEspecially if this leak turns out to be true, sticking a 60Hz panel without AOD on a brand-new device in 2023 (from a premium respected brand, no less) is a peculiar cost-cutting measure. With competitors moving to 90Hz and beyond even on their low-end models, and not to mention always-on displays being de facto standards on Android devices, it seems laughable that Apple is pulling this stunt. While occupying lower rungs than the Pro models, these are still pricey devices.\n\nPresently, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max offer LTPO displays, which allows for variable refresh rates from 1Hz for static, non-motion situations like AOD, all the way to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and gaming. Coincidentally, both models were the first Apple phones to introduce AOD.\n\nOn the plus side, there are plenty things to look forward to with the iPhone 15 base and Plus models. The display driver is said to be more power efficient, the Dynamic Island should be trickling down (gone is the Notch), and the display itself will have thinner bezels and a subtle curve to the edges for better handling. These models are also expected to bring USB-C charging in response to EU legislation.\n\nWe're curious to know what you think about these reported display omissions. If your budget is limited, would you actually buy a base or Plus iPhone 15, or would you opt for a discounted iPhone 14 Pro model? Is it strategic move to push consumers to buy the Pro models?

                    "body": "The iPhone 15 rumors are gaining steam and even though not all of them are promising, a lot of iPhone users will gravitate toward the new models simply because their phones are due for an upgrade.The iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to pack a lot of new features, including a periscope telephoto camera and titanium chassis. Both Pro models are also likely to have the A17 Bionic chip, which will be based on the new 3nm manufacturing tech. The standard models will probably have the Dynamic Island cutout, but the always-on display and 120Hz refresh rate will remain exclusive to the Pros. The entire lineup is expected to switch to USB-C ports and solid-state buttons.",

                    "body": "Counterpoint analysts summed up the results of 2022, naming the best-selling smartphones in the world. And their data looks quite curious.\n\nThe market leader was expectedly the iPhone 13. Exactly like the iPhone 12 before it, the iPhone 11 before it, and the iPhone XR before it. However, you can immediately notice that the iPhone 14 may not repeat the achievements of its predecessors, since at the end of 2022 it was only in seventh place. Of course, 2023 has only just begun, but so far the new base model doesn't look as strong as many generations before it. Although it is already worth noting here that in December it was the iPhone 14 that took first place, so obviously not everything is lost for the model.\n\nThe second place was taken by the iPhone 13 Pro Max, and the third place was already taken by the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which, unlike its younger brother, did not prevent the launch in the fall of 2022 from taking an honorable third place. And here it is worth noting that the second and third places were taken by the most expensive Apple models of two generations. That is, Apple has already managed to shift sales towards more expensive versions, and all available rumors and leaks say that in the new line, the division between younger and older iPhones will be even more noticeable.\n\nThe top ten also includes Samsung Galaxy A13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone SE 2022 and Galaxy A03. That is, in the top ten there are almost all iPhones of the current and previous generations, except for the iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nAnalysts note that in 2022, for the first time, iPhone Pro Max models outsold iPhone Pro within the same generation. We can see that this was true for both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 13.",

                    "title": "New Apple Exclusive Reveals iPhone 15 Design Shock",
                    "body": "According to a new leak from (historically reliable) insider yeux1122, Apple will break with industry trends and again make its ProMotion 120Hz displays iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max exclusives. This would be the third year in succession that Apple has limited high refresh rate (HRR) panels to its most expensive iPhones, and it is increasingly unjustifiable.\n\nThe value of a high refresh rate display is that by refreshing up to twice as often as a standard 60Hz panel, animations become smoother, resulting in a more fluid experience. Touch input is also recognized more quickly, making taps and swipes more responsive.\n\nMoreover, high refresh rates have quickly become mainstream, with the likes of Samsung's $299 Galaxy M33 and RealMe's $199 Narzo 50 even bringing 120Hz displays to the budget sector. So why is Apple continuing to limit its 120Hz 'ProMotion' displays to $1,000 iPhones? It comes down to two factors: implementation and marketing.\n\nIn terms of implementation, Apple only uses LTPO panels for ProMotion. This is because operating at 120Hz quickly drains battery life on standard screens, which cheaper 120Hz phones use. In contrast, LTPO panels offer a variable refresh rate, which can drop as low as 1Hz when the screen is static to reduce battery consumption.\n\nDoes this mean all cheap 120Hz phones have terrible battery life? No. Some just fit bigger batteries, but Apple prefers its premium implementation. Apple also only offers its always-on display on iPhones with LTPO panels, so iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models again look set to miss out on this based feature for another year.\n\nAs for marketing, it is a problem of Apple's own making. Currently, ProMotion is only used for Pro-branded products: Macbook Pro, iPad Pro and iPhone Pro. So anything short of rebranding ProMotion will only likely confuse buyers and muddle the company's carefully delineated product lines. I suspect Apple understands this issue because it hasn't branded any tech as \"Pro-\" since ProMotion first launched in 2017.\n\nNone of which does anything to help iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus buyers, who just want the high refresh rates they are seeing on rival phones at much cheaper prices. We now know that won't change for at least another year, though the introduction of an updated design, a locked-down version of USB-C and some crazy new colors will be some consolation.",

Apple has launched a new yellow option for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, adding an even brighter hue to what has long been voted the best smartphone.\n\nreadily available in yellow\n\nStarting March 10th, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available in a new yellow option.\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available for pre-order starting March 10th, with general availability starting March 14th. This new color joins the existing Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight and (Product) Red options for a total of six options to choose from. from. However, it doesn't look like the high-end iPhone 14 Pro will get a new color this spring, so if you really like yellow, you'll have to stick with the base iPhone 14.\n\nApple has made a tradition of launching a new iPhone color every spring, with the iPhone 12 getting a purple option in 2021 and the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro getting various shades of green last year. It's unclear why the iPhone 14 Pro wasn't loved by this spring refresh, but Apple's top-of-the-line phone suffers from general supply constraints.\n\n@cnnunderscored\n\nWould you like to buy this #newiphone color?

It creates a nice two-tone look. Since the iPhone 11, the iPhone has not had a proper yellow variant. We also tried out the new yellow silicone case that has the same bright yellow coating all over the phone (this can be fun to mix and match with blue, pink, etc.).\n\nNew colors aside, this is exactly like the iPhone 14 that launched last fall, and that's not a bad thing. ), long battery life, and fast performance.

Today, the firm is out with a new study showing how age impacts the likelihood of using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\n\nCIRP released its new report today titled \"The Apple Ecosystem Age Profile Works\" on Substack.\n\nContinuing its mission to better understand the inner workings of Apple's business, CIRP decided to dig into how age plays a role in using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\n\nCIRP notes that Apple advertises as a \"younger brand\" for all of its products and indeed \"device owners tend to be younger than average US consumers.\" But in particular, it was curious if those trends held true across iPhone, iPad, and Mac users.\n\nAs it turns out, roughly half of all iPhone, iPad, and Mac owners are between the ages of 18 and 34. And 18 to 44-year-olds make up over 70% of Apple users across the three hero devices.\n\nLess than 30% of iPhone, iPad, and Mac owners were 45 or older.\n\nAll three products had very similar splits on age but Mac ownership did trend a bit younger than iPhone and iPad.\n\nIn conclusion, CIRP says with customer age profiles not varying much by device, \"the Apple plan is working.\"",

                    "body": "Apple's next-generation iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are once again rumored to feature an improved LiDAR Scanner supplied by Sony.\n\nIn a research note shared with investors this week, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Tom O'Malley said Sony could supply the majority, if not all, of LiDAR Scanner components for the iPhone 15 Pro models launching later this year.\n\nSony could take a majority, if not all, of the share on the world facing sensor in this years' models with the company providing a module, VCSEL, receiver and driver. This is a negative headwind to both LITE and COHR which we view as likely.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last month said Sony would replace Lumentum and WIN Semiconductors as the exclusive supplier of LiDAR Scanner components for the iPhone 15 Pro models. Kuo said Sony's solution is more power efficient and could result in the LiDAR Scanner offering improved performance at the same level of power consumption, or equal performance with less of an impact on battery life.\n\nIntroduced on iPhone 12 Pro models in 2020, the LiDAR Scanner can measure light distance and capture depth information, and the hardware is expected to remain exclusive to iPhone 15 Pro models. An improved LiDAR Scanner could be beneficial to augmented reality apps, Night mode photos, and camera autofocus.\n\nOther rumored iPhone 15 Pro features include an A17 Bionic chip, a USB-C port, a titanium frame with solid-state buttons, thinner bezels around the display, and more.",

                    "body": "By submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions (opens in new tab) and Privacy Policy (opens in new tab) and are aged 16 or over.\n\nWe're still around six months away from the expected launch of the iPhone 15 range, but already there have been swathes of rumours about the handset. Most of the information which has come out relates to Pro variants of the phone, including a potential new model called the iPhone 15 Ultra.\n\nThose rumoured upgrades include a titanium frame and a 3nm processor on Pro-variants, Dynamic Island coming to all models, and a more power efficient OLED display chip. That last one should improve overall battery life across all models.\n\nBut the latest rumour about the vanilla iPhone 15 models suggests they may not be as feature packed as we'd hoped. According to a leak on a Korean blog (opens in new tab), only the Pro variants will have a display capable of supporting features like Always-On Display and ProMotion. The source - an account called yeux1122 - has a decent track record when it comes to Apple information, having previously called the release of the iPad (10th generation) and the M2 iPad Pro, as well as pricing on the iPhone 14 range.\n\nWhile it isn't outwardly confirmed, that likely means another year of standard iPhone models sporting a display with a static 60Hz refresh rate. That's a real shame for users. Most of the best cheap phones we've seen have better display stats than that, and cost considerably less. And while it may not be the be all and end all for some users, it will grate on others.\n\nWhen we're talking about a phone that is likely to retail around the \u00a3800 / $800 mark, it's fair to expect a top-tier display. Having recently used the Xiaomi 13, which has a 120Hz adaptive refresh display, I found myself longing for the crisp motion when I went back to using an iPhone. Features like the Always-On Display also offer added value.\n\nIt would be a shame for the base models to miss out on those features. While it may push some to opt for the Pro variants, it could also cause eyes to wander externally.",

                    "body": "After Apple unveiled a new iPhone 13 in green at this time last year and the previous year unveiled the iPhone 12 in purple, Apple has just announced the arrival of yellow for the iPhone 14. It repeats a move that launches the new color for this spring, accompanied by accessories in various colors and new designs.\n\nApple has officially announced that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available in a new color: yellow. This option joins the existing Midnight, Starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, Blue and Purple. This gives us more to choose from when it comes to buying one of the longest battery life iPhones in its history. Bob Borchers, Apple's Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing said:\n\n\"iPhone already accompanies users in everything they do on a daily basis, and now we have a sensational addition to the lineup with a new yellow color for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. With its excellent battery life, lightweight design, professional camera and video advancements, groundbreaking security features such as SOS Satellite Emergency and the full capabilities of iOS 16, iPhone 14 is the ideal choice for anyone looking for a new iPhone.\"\n\nIf we are interested in buying the new iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus in yellow color, we can make the reservation from next Friday, March 10 at 14:00 (time of peninsular Spain). The first units will start arriving to those who have reserved it on Tuesday, March 14. Meanwhile, if we want to wait to see it in person, it will also be from March 14 that we can find it in Apple Stores and authorized resellers. A good time to decide whether to get this brilliant iPhone.\n\nApple has also released a number of accessories to complement the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. Cases, straps for the Apple Watch - including the Herm\u00e8s collection - and even accessories for the AirTag add to the color changes. Colors with such eye-catching names as Bud Green, Canary Yellow, Olive, Purple Mist, Bright Orange and so on. Colors with which we can combine the yellow of our new iPhone as we consider best.\n\nIt is clear that the design of the iPhone is a major selling point and attraction. A design that as we have seen in the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro, changes regularly, version to version and that for a few years now adds a unique color for each generation. Subsequently, near the arrival of spring, Apple renews the colors of its accessories and presents a variant that, in this case, is more spring than ever. A phone that, while waiting for new colors for the iPhone 15, from this Friday can be ours and that we will be able to enjoy next March 14.",

                    "body": "Apple has taken the tech industry by surprise and dropped a new 'Yellow' handset on its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models. The noticeably spring-themed colourway will be available to buy at the end of this week, hitting online stores this Friday, March 10.\n\nThe latest handset is already available to buy in Blue, Starlight (silver), Midnight (black) and Red, after dropping its signature iPhone 13 pro 'Sierra Blue' and 'Alpine Green' colourways during last year's launch of the iPhone 14 models. The iPhone 14 also comes in Deep Purple, which launched around the same time as rivals Samsung launched their handset in 'Bora Purple'.\n\nThe latest handset will drop on the UK Apple store this Friday, and is priced the same as the rest of the model line-up from \u00a3849 for the standard model, \u00a3949 for the iPhone 14 Plus and, but it is not available on the biggest and most expensive iPhone 14 Pro range. As soon as the new model launches a host of UK retailers are expected to have the new variation in stock, ready to buy.\n\nREAD MORE: Apple iPhone 14 review: what you should know before you buy\n\nAlthough it's not been confirmed, UK retailers who already stock the iPhone 14 range are expected to add the latest vibrant yellow to the list, amongst the more unique purple and red colours. Apart from buying through the Apple store, John Lewis is the only third-party retailer we've seen so far with a nod to the new colourway.\n\nCustomers can set up a 'notify me' alert to buy the yellow handset on three versions of the iPhone 14 Plus model, either the 126GB model, the 256GB or the 512GB which starts from \u00a3949.\n\nRetailers including Vodafone, Curry's, Amazon and EE are also popular outlets for the models and currently have stock in all existing colours, so the new yellow will likely be added.\n\nIt's not the first time Apple has tried out this statement colour as it's seemingly brought back the yellow as previously seen on the 2019 iPhone 11. The surprise new addition could be a hint that another iPhone release is expected this coming spring, and it wouldn't be 'out of the question' when looking at previous product launches from the tech giants.\n\nAt the end of March 2022, Apple launched the third-generation iPhone SE before the highly anticipated launch of the iPhone 14 range the following September.\n\nThe iPhone 15 is rumoured to be the latest new handset launch hitting Apple's product lineup later this year, thought to be in September to fit in with recent launches over the years.\n\nThe updated yellow colourway is the first new addition to Apple's smartphone range for 2023, on the back of the newest MacBook Pro which hit UK stores in January.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nApple AirPod Pro dupes slashed to \u00a39.99 and they have same features as \u00a3170+ model\n\nThe cheapest S23, S23+ and S23 Ultra deals as latest Galaxy handsets launch in UK stores\n\nThree Mobile launches 'social tariff' contract for phone users struggling with cost of living\n\nWhere to buy the new Apple iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in the UK - full list of availability\n\nApple launches first device for 2023 and it's very similar to Amazon Echo",

                    "body": "It says a lot about a phone when the most-talked thing about its next iteration is its new volume buttons. That's what the Apple iPhone is in 2023. It doesn't fold, it doesn't have a periscope zoom lens, it doesn't fast charge, the design has been the same for years, it's uncomfortable to hold, and its cameras are no longer the best -- something proved most recently in our Galaxy S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 Pro camera test.\n\nContents The iPhone has a folding problemApple's camera crown has been stolenNo fast charging in 2023 is a big missApple, please make the iPhone exciting again\n\nIn the past few years, iPhones haven't seen any kind of big new innovation. The Dynamic Island had the potential to be the innovation we'd been waiting for, but that hasn't come to fruition. When you add all that together, it makes the iPhone the most boring phone you can buy in 2023. Here's why.\n\nThe iPhone has a folding problem\n\nSamsung has been in the foldable segment for four years now. Moreover, several Chinese smartphone manufacturers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi are making foldable designs that are better than Samsung's. Heck, even Honor and Tecno are breaching the foldable niche with the Honor Magic Vs and Tecno Phantom V Fold.\n\nRelated The iPhone 14 now comes in this yellow color, and I'm obsessed with it I think I made a huge mistake with my iPhone 14 Pro Max The best smartwatches and wearables of MWC 2023\n\nApple is just playing safe at this point by ignoring the folding market. The company has all the money in the world for R&D to develop a folding iPhone. Apple fans, please don't tell me, \"Apple will release it when it's ready\" or \"Apple never releases a half-baked product.\"\n\nThe argument that Apple releases products when they're matured is ... well, false. Just one look at the buggy mess that was iOS 16 at launch is easy proof of that. Plus, foldables have been in the market for four years now, which is enough time for a segment to mature, in my opinion.\n\nApple not releasing a foldable iPhone for the next couple of years is simply riding on the success of the iPhone to deliver average products until it comes out with one big leap. We might already be on Galaxy Z Fold 7 or so by the time the first foldable iPhone releases.\n\nThe argument that Apple releases products when they're matured is ... well, false.\n\nAnd if Apple is intent on sticking with the slab phone design, it needs to come up with a better one. The move to flat edges with iPhone 12 is one of the most unergonomic design decisions from Apple in the past few years. And surprisingly, the company has stuck with the same design ever since.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, OnePlus 11, and Xiaomi 13 Pro are all more comfortable to hold, thanks to the curves on the sides. I have used the iPhone 12, iPhone 13 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max as my primary devices, and all of them were uncomfortable to hold. For a company so intent on only making \"regular\" smartphones, its current design direction leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nApple's camera crown has been stolen\n\nMost people in the U.S. don't realize that the iPhone camera isn't the best anymore. It lags behind the Vivo X90 Pro in night mode. The telephoto lens is of limited use when compared to the Galaxy S23 Ultra with 10x optical zoom. The Xiaomi 13 Pro's natural depth of field has no competition, thanks to its 1-inch sensor. Oppo and OnePlus have the fun XPan mode to discover more perspectives with wide shots. Xiaomi and Realme phones have a wide range of options with long exposure and star trails.\n\nBy contrast, an iPhone doesn't have any standout camera feature. There is a 48MP camera with ProRAW, which is amazing for someone who has the time to play around with details in Lightroom but not so much for an average user. It's the most boring set of cameras you can carry with you.\n\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra has also narrowed down the iPhone's video lead immensely with its super steady mode. Any Chinese-made or Galaxy phone focuses faster in portrait mode than the iPhone. Does any of this matter when iPhone sales are at an all-time high? Maybe not. But for those of us who have access to products outside of Apple, we see how far behind the company is right now on the camera front.\n\nNo fast charging in 2023 is a big miss\n\nI stuck with the iPhones because the Pro Max series used to be the longest-lasting smartphone on a single charge; the iPhone 13 Pro Max was the gold standard for battery life. But that's not the case in 2023.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra lasts just as long -- if not more -- as the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Combine that with the fact that you are still stuck with slow charging standards on the iPhone, and the battery/charging situation isn't the best. We have smartphones that charge to full in under an hour or offer 50% battery life within 15 minutes. And that's not taking into account the bonkers 240W fast charging on the Realme GT 3 that delivers a 0% to 100% charge in less than 10 minutes.\n\nThere is a misconception that fast charging degrades battery life in the long run. But I've used the 2019 OnePlus 7T (with 30W charging, which was considered fast back then) for three years, and didn't face an issue with battery life until I updated the OS. The same goes for OnePlus 8T with 65W fast charging; It's still going strong. Saying that Apple isn't providing fast charging above 27W due to safety reasons is a lame excuse when the industry has clearly figured out a way for it.\n\nApple, please make the iPhone exciting again\n\nThe latest iPhones are still among the best smartphones in 2023. The shutter speed on the camera is top-notch, and it processes the image swiftly, while the competition takes a few minutes to get in the details in processing. I love the fact that I can easily and quickly edit photos in Lightroom without lag.\n\nBut that's about it. I can't use multi-window on iOS, and in day-to-day use, the Galaxy S23 Ultra feels more responsive. The OnePlus 11 is more comfortable to hold, and Xiaomi 13 Pro has a better primary camera sensor.\n\nThere is not one outstanding feature on an iPhone. It's an average phone or even mediocre in some areas, which makes it the most boring phone you can buy in 2023. I hope we get exciting new features with the iPhone 15 this year, but if rumors are any indication, we are in for disappointment.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Android does this one thing so much better than iOS, and it drives me crazy iPhone 15: release date and price predictions, leaks, rumors, and more I tested the Galaxy S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 Pro cameras.

                    "body": "Benzinga - Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) may have had its fair share of problems in 2022 but that didn't stop it from ruling the roost in the smartphone market.\n\nWhat Happened: Apple took eight spots in the top 10 best-selling smartphones in 2022, a first for a brand, data released by market research firm Counterpoint showed.\n\nApple's iPhone 13 was the best-selling smartphone model in 2022, leading in most major markets such as China, the U.K., Germany and France.\n\nIt continued to be the best seller from its launch in Sept. 2021 through August 2022 and saw uptake even after the launch of the next generation of iPhones in Sept. 2022, benefiting from price reductions, Counterpoint said.\n\niPhone 13 sales were two times as much as the next best-seller, the iPhone 13 Pro Max.\n\nThe only non-Apple smartphone in the top 10 list was South Korean electronics giant Samsung's Galaxy A13 and Galaxy A03.\n\niPhone 14 Pro Max Surges To Lead: Following the launch of the iPhone 14 series, Apple's priciest model, the iPhone 14 Pro Max, quickly took the lead, toppling the iPhone 13 in volume. The iPhone 14 Pro Max was the top-selling smartphone in September, October and November before the iPhone 14 took its spot in December.\n\nWhy It's Important: Apple stuttered in the December quarter, which encompasses the key holiday season, owing to production and demand issues. The company reported its first revenue decline in about three-and-half years as sales of its flagship iPhone fell year-over-year.\n\nGoldman Sachs this week issued Apple a \"Buy\" rating for the first time in about six years. The firm said investors should be focused on the company's installed user base and recurring revenue growth from the Services businesses rather than on the revenue headwinds. The firm assigned a $199 price target for Apple, suggesting over 30% upside potential.\n\nApple closed Tuesday's session down 1.45% at $151.60, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next: Apple In Final Stages Of Production Testing New iMacs, Says Gurman: What Investors Should Know",

                    "title": "iPhone 15 Series' Success Will Partly Be Due To 25 Percent Current User Base That Has Yet To Upgrade In Four Years, Says Investment Firm",
                    "body": "On their own, Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 series, particularly the 'Pro' versions, is expected to see a rise in sales and popularity, due to their long list of upgrades, including a shift to USB-C, negating the need to use a different cable. However, an investment firm believes that another reason why the new lineup will do well is because a quarter of Apple's current installed iPhone base has yet to upgrade in four or more years.\n\nWedbush analysts have provided their input concerning the potential success of the iPhone 15 family. Given that an aged iPhone shows obvious signs of performance and battery endurance issues, especially when it is kept for four years or more, customers must be chomping at the bit to upgrade. According to the report from AppleInsider, the following details have been provided regarding the launch and imminent success of the upcoming series.\n\n\"We estimate roughly 25% of the current iPhone installed base has not upgraded their iPhone in 4 years+. With the highly anticipated anniversary edition iPhone 15 set to be launched in the September timeframe, the baton handoff from iPhone 14 to iPhone 15 looks to be a steadier transition than some other peak to valley iPhone cycles of the past.\"\n\nApple could also be paying some extra focus on the cheaper iPhone 15 models to prop sales. This will include incorporating features like the Dynamic Island, a possible price cut compared to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, though the lack of ProMotion and other display-centric additions might irritate customers. Apple continuing to charge $799 for a device that ships with a 60Hz in 2023 might be considered criminal to some.\n\nSteady production was an area that forced Apple to lose out on a significant number of sales in the final quarter last year, so the company likely has multiple contingencies in place to prevent another repeat of history. Our own take is that the iPhone 15 series will do much better this year in the fourth quarter compared to the iPhone 14 in 2022, and we will keep you updated on the latest.",

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro lineups have different colors to choose from, so if you have your heart set on a particular shade, you may not be able to get your preferred model in that color. Check out our guide on the iPhone 14 Pro color options for more information about those devices.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are now available in a total of six colors, four of which are new shades. Although previous standard iPhone lineup color options have tended to be bolder and brighter, in 2022, Apple chose to offer a slightly more muted color palette, with the exception of a brighter PRODUCT(RED) and Yellow. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus's six available color options are:\n\nMidnight and Starlight were carried over from the iPhone 13 lineup, but the new PRODUCT(RED) has been tweaked to be brighter and more saturated. A portion of the proceeds for the (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 14 go the Global Fund COVID-19 Response, which provides support to healthcare systems and preserves HIV and AIDS programs in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWhile the iPhone 13 lineup was available in a warm Blue with a hint of turquoise, this year's shade is much lighter and more of a sky blue. Purple replaces the iPhone 13's candyfloss-like Pink color and is similarly a fairly subtle, light shade. Green has not been carried over this year.\n\nAs part of a spring color refresh that also brought new MagSafe Silicone Cases, Apple Watch bands, and AirTag accessories, Apple introduced a new Yellow color option for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. Apple last offered a Yellow color option for the iPhone in 2019 with the iPhone 11, which came just one year after the Yellow iPhone XR.\n\nApple usually introduces new iPhone color options in the spring to boost sales midway through the device's product cycle. Last March, Apple introduced a new Green color for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, and a new Alpine Green color for the iPhone 13 Pro models. In April 2021, Apple made the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini available in Purple. Having been released six months after the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus launched, there will likely be far fewer Yellow iPhone 14 models around compared to the other color options, so it could be a good choice for a more unique and up-to-date look.\n\nIt is also worth noting that there are no black and white color options in the iPhone 14 lineup. Upon the launch of the iPhone 13, Apple replaced White, which featured silver aluminum edges, with Starlight. Starlight is similar to the White option from the iPhone 12 lineup, but is now a distinctively warmer shade that is almost pearl or cream-colored. The silver edges now contain a hint of gold to match the new, warmer look. Starlight is effectively analogous to the iPhone 14 Pro's cool Silver color, but with less prominent matte aluminum edges and a warmer, almost champagne tone.\n\nLikewise, the Midnight iPhone 14 should not be confused with previous Black, Space Gray, or Graphite devices and was a new color introduced with the iPhone 13 lineup. Midnight replaces Black as the standard model's darkest color option, but differs from Black since it has a slight hint of navy blue.\n\nHow to Decide on a Color\n\nIf you use your iPhone with a case, you may wish to consider which device color will best complement your case. You may prefer more neutral tones such as Midnight or Starlight, and then use a more colorful case. Alternatively, you could choose a more striking device color like Purple, and then use a more neutral case.\n\nStarlight and Midnight may age better over time as new devices are released since they are more neutral, almost monochrome shades, and have been offered across multiple iPhone generations. If you do not use a case at all, you may wish to take advantage of a more eye-catching color option such as Blue.\n\nYellow could be a good choice, especially when combined with the Canary Yellow Silicone Case, for a bold look, especially if you have enjoyed similar versions of the iPhone XR and iPhone 11 in previous years.\n\nIf you want an iPhone in a brand new shade, Blue, Purple, and Yellow are the only options. The Purple and Yellow, in particular, are the colors that are most noticeably new and indicate that you have the latest-generation device.\n\nYour color choice may also be dependent on how often you upgrade your iPhone. If you upgrade every year, you may be more confident in buying a more noticeable new color, but if you keep your iPhone for many years, it may be wiser to consider a color that you have enjoyed before if it is still available.\n\nCustomers with multiple Apple devices may also want to get an iPhone color that complements their other devices. For example, if you have a Purple iPad Air or iPad mini, it will be best complemented by the Purple iPhone 14. If you already have a Space Gray MacBook Pro, it will likely be best accompanied by a Midnight iPhone 14. Likewise, if you have a Starlight Apple Watch, it will obviously match the Starlight iPhone 14, and the Pink 24-inch iMac will best match the PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 14.\n\nArticle Link: iPhone 14 Color Options: Which Color Should You Choose?",

                    "body": "In 2022, Apple became the first brand to capture eight spots in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones, according to Counterpoint Research's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker. The remaining two spots were taken by Samsung with both models representing lower-end models. Samsung's flagship Galaxy S22 didn't make the cut. The top-10 list contributed 19% of the total global smartphone sales in 2022, the same as in 2021.\n\nApple's iPhone 13 was the best-selling smartphone of 2022, contributing 28% of iPhone sales. It was the best-selling smartphone in major markets such as China, US, UK, Germany and France. Further, the iPhone 13 remained the number one smartphone each month from its launch in September 2021 till August 2022.\n\nPrice cuts after the iPhone 14 series' launch further drove the iPhone 13 volumes in developing markets. The iPhone 13 sales were two times more than that of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the second best-selling smartphone in 2022.\n\n(Click on Chart to Greatly Enlarge)\n\nFor the first time, a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models in 2022. It helped the iPhone 14 Pro Max to capture the third spot in the 2022 list. It was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October and November of 2022. The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant. Major advancements in the iPhone 14 Pro series, such as dynamic island and faster processor, make it more attractive, as the base model is almost identical to the previous year's model.\n\nThe iPhone 12, the best-selling smartphone of 2021, was the oldest model in the top 10 for 2022. Its sales remained robust in the US, Japan and China. The price cuts with each year's new iPhone launch increased its value proposition while its 5G capability also played an important role. The iPhone SE 2022, among the most compact phones in the industry, grabbed the tenth spot. Like its predecessor, it managed to sell well in Japan.\n\nOnly two entry-level Samsung smartphones, the Galaxy A13 and Galaxy A03, made the list. That was one more model than the list of 2021.",

                    "body": "As many of you know, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are rumored to use solid-state buttons. Well, something interesting just surfaced. An alleged iPhone 15 frame appeared, with solid-state buttons on the side.\n\nThis image appeared on Twitter (shown below), and was shared by 'fix Apple'. Having said that, this image could be fake. Why? Well, first and foremost, the frame shown here has a matte finish. That may not seem odd to you at first, but hear me out.\n\nApple tends to use a glossy finish on the 'Pro' iPhone series. Those phones usually feature glossy stainless steel. That leads us to believe this is either the regular iPhone 15 frame, or a frame that doesn't belong to an iPhone at all.\n\nThe base iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models are not expected to utilize solid-state buttons. On the flip side, the rumors may have been wrong, and Apple may go all in after all. There are a lot of possibilities here.\n\nOne more thing is worth noting. Apple is also rumored to switch from stainless steel to a titanium frame on the 'Pro' models. We're not sure that will be happening, but it's worth noting. The company may even change the coating to a matte finish on the 'Pro' models.\n\nAs I said, things are very complicated at the moment, as the company could go either way. There are a lot of rumors circulating around, but one thing does seem certain, at least the 'Pro' iPhone models will include solid-state buttons.\n\nAll iPhone 15 units, base and 'Pro' ones, will feature a Dynamic Island this time around. The same goes for a Type-C port, as they will be the first iPhones to feature such a port. Apple may limit it, however.",

                    "body": "A new rumor says Apple won't be upgrading the screen on the non-Pro models.\n\nThe steady supply of iPhone 15 leaks continues, with fresh information emerging this week about the screen features of Apple's 2023 handsets. But it's not good news for those planning to buy the standard iPhone 15.\n\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, according to an anonymous industry source cited by \"yeux1122\" on the Korean Naver blog, still won't get access to the ProMotion dynamic screen tech which arrived on the Pro models in 2021 and enables a phone to adjust the refresh rate to suit its current activity and preserve battery life. As the blog writes (via automated translation), \"What is confirmed here is that only the Pro Series will have a specification that supports LTPO 120 refresh rate, with the basic regular [and] Plus model not having it in [their] requirements.\"\n\nThis logically means, as MacRumors reasons, that the standard models won't get the always-on screen feature that debuted last year either, because ProMotion's ability to lower refresh rate all the way down to 1Hz was essential in stopping the always-on screen from being a battery killer. While ProMotion is a subtle improvement that produces smoother animation and better battery performance without the user necessarily being aware of it, the always-on screen is an in-your-face flagship feature, and (comparatively) budget-minded customers will be disappointed to miss out again.\n\nyeux1122 has a spotty track record, accurately predicting the iPhone 14 price and Deep Purple color, but missing on RAM and charging speeds. But this rumor tracks with previous predictions: last September Ross Young, a displays industry analyst with an excellent track record, made the same prediction. On the plus side, Young reports that the Dynamic Island will be available on the non-Pro model later this year.\n\nIt looks, in other words, as though Apple plans to continue its recent strategy of pushing customers into buying the more expensive Pro models, even to the detriment of sales of the standard phones. In 2022, the standard iPhone 14 missed out on a plethora of Pro upgrades-ProMotion, the always-on display, and the Dynamic Island-and it didn't even get the latest processor. This is all aside from the usual differential of a weaker camera system and an inability to access the highest storage tiers. In our iPhone 14 review, we called it \"basically an iPhone 13s.\"\n\nFor the latest news and rumors about this year's new iPhones, check out our regularly updated iPhone 15 superguide.",

                    "body": "\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Archers, Vice President, Worldwide Product Marketing, Apple.\n\n(1.) The existing colour schemes are Midnight, Starlight, Product Red, Blue and Purple. In yellow, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB storage capacities will be available.\n\n(2.) According to Apple, the two smartphones, which, along with iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max, constitute the sixteenth generation of the company's flagship device, are resistant to both water and dust. A Ceramic Shield front cover, 'tougher than any smartphone glass,' protects the two devices from common spills and accidents.\n\n(3.) For photography, iPhones 14 and 14 Pro get an advanced dual camera system. A new pro-level Main camera has a large sensor to provide gorgeous photos and videos, while an Ultra Wide camera captures unique perspectives.\n\n(4.) These come powered by an A15 Bionic chipset, which has a 5-core GPUfor faster speeds. The chipset also powers camera features such as Photonic Engine, Action mode and Cinematic mode.\n\n(5.) To minimise impact on the environment, the smartphones have been designed from upcycled plastic bottles. These also include 100% recycled gold, 100% recycled tin, 100% recycled rare earth elements, and 100% recycled tungsten.",

                    "body": "Apple has announced a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. It will add more color choices to the lineup this spring.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have a durable Ceramic Shield front cover. It also comes with an updated internal design for better sustained performance and easier repairs, and amazing battery life. The iPhone 14 Plus is set to have the longest battery life of any iPhone ever.\n\nBoth models have a dual-camera system, the A15 Bionic chip, Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection. The new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available to pre-order this Friday, March 10, with availability starting Tuesday, March 14.\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing.\n\n\"The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.\"\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus offer safety capabilities to provide emergency assistance when it matters.\n\nEmergency SOS via satellite allows users to send a message with emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are unavailable. It works through a combination of custom-designed components and deeply integrated software.\n\nUsers can reassure family and friends of their whereabouts while off the grid. They can open the Find My app and share their location via satellite.\n\nEmergency SOS via satellite and Find My via satellite are currently available in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the U.K., and the U.S. It will be available in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal later this month.\n\nThe service will be included for free for two years starting at the time of activation of a new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nCrash Detection on the iPhone 14 lineup detects a severe car crash and automatically dials emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.\n\nApple's algorithms went through a million hours of real-world driving and crash record data to bring this innovative safety feature to life. It includes motion inputs from its new accelerometer and gyroscope, GPS, barometer, and microphone.\n\nWhen paired with Apple Watch, Crash Detection leverages the strength of both devices.",

                    "body": "We're about halfway through the life of the iPhone 14, if Apple's annual iPhone announcement cycle is anything to go by, with all eyes now focussing on an expected September release date for the iPhone 15. But new leaks suggest a much-hoped-for improvement may skip Apple's base-level iPhone 15 this year.\n\nAccording to leaker yeus1122 (citing an industry source as seen on the Korean blog Naver (opens in new tab)), the standard iPhone 15 will feature neither ProMotion nor always-on display features that were present in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models. ProMotion makes for smoother movement across the phone by allowing refresh rates as fast as 120Hz, while the always-on feature is made possible by keeping battery drain to a minimum with a 1Hz refresh rate. Both require an LPTO panel (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) in order to work, and help to make the best iPhones shine.\n\nBut according to the leak, via a Google translation, \"only the Pro series supports the LTPO 120 refresh rate, and the basic general [and] Plus model does not have that content.\"\n\nThe source has a decent track record when it comes to Apple rumors, accurately predicting the 2023 MacBook Pro launches, and the display rumor further corroborates information that Apple analyst Ross Young has previously shared.\n\nIt's a damn shame then. It's not unusual for Apple to bring the high-end features of last year's Pro models to the standard model the following year, but that's not apparently the case with iPhone 15.\n\nThat stings this year in particular, as, of all the recent standard iPhone launches, the iPhone 14 seemed a particularly conservative upgrade over its predecessor.\n\nSo what will be upgraded for iPhone 15? Current rumors say that the Dynamic Island will be coming to all iPhone 15 devices, not just the iPhone 15 Pro, while a 28nm OLED driver chip process should lead to improved battery life. As ever though, we'll need to wait for Apple's official unveiling to know for sure. For now, those looking at an iPhone 15 device may end up better served with an iPhone 14 Pro instead, should its price fall.",

                    "body": "AppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\n\nCiting signs of rebounding demand for iPhones in China, expected new products, and an anticipated rise in services, Wedbush has again raised its Apple stock price target.\n\nAt the start of 2023, Wedbush lowered its Apple price target from $200 to $175, saying that while Apple was in a strong position, it was facing uncertain economic environments. Following Apple's latest financial results in February, it raised the price to $180, and has now again increased it to $190.\n\nIn a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, Wedbush describes Apple as now being \"a steady Cupertino ship in rough macro waters.\"\n\nThe description and the rise in the price follows how Wedbush's \"Asia iPhone supply chain checks this week have been incrementally more positive.\" The firm's survey shows \"a modest uptick in demand coming out of China... with a clear demand rebound happening in this key region post December despite the uncertain macro backdrop.\"\n\nWedbush analysts also say that there is no sign of any significant cuts in iPhone production, \"which is a good sign that shows a steady demand curve on the flagship iPhone 14 Pro.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Wedbush says that \"a number of levers potentially abound for Apple.\" Those include \"noteworthy\" new announcements, including an Apple AR headset \"launch by the summer\", and \"hardware subscription plan [being] unveiled.\"\n\nAlongside a potential hardware subscription plan, though, Wedbush expects \"some new hardware launches on the Mac product line in 2023.\"\n\nThe company also believes that the next iPhone is likely to do well. That is partly because \"we estimate roughly 25% of the current iPhone installed base has not upgraded their iPhone in 4 years+,\" but there is more reason to expect a rise in sales.\n\n\"With the highly anticipated anniversary edition iPhone 15 set to be launched in the September timeframe,\" says Wedbusy, \"the baton handoff from iPhone 14 to iPhone 15 looks to be a steadier transition than some other peak to valley iPhone cycles of the past.\"\n\nThe firm isn't expecting a commemorative edition of the iPhone when it speaks about \"anniversary.\" Rather, it appears to be referring to the annual release cycle.\n\nWedbush also predicts that Apple's \"Services business [is] set to see an acceleration in FY24,\" and that this comes from \"another 100 million+ new iPhone users... added over the last 15 months.\"\n\n\"The golden installed base of Apple is creating more stability in this uncertain macro and remains key to our bullish thesis,\" say the firm's analysts.\n\nWedbush's reasoning behind its price rise is close to identical to the equally positive report JP Morgan recently released.",

                    "body": "The Apple iPhone 14, The Apple iPhone 14 Pro and the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max are seen at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan, New York City\n\nThe year 2022 was a big year for phone maker Apple as eight of its smartphone models were among the top 10 best-selling smartphones worldwide.\n\nAccording to global research firm Counterpoint Research's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker, the top 10 best-selling smartphones accounted for 19% of the total global smartphone sales last year.\n\nApple's iPhone 13 ranked first among the best-selling smartphones, contributing 28% of total iPhone sales last year. It was the most-sold smartphone in China, the U.S., the U.K., Germany and France, according to the sales tracker.\n\nLast year also marked the first time that a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series exceeded the sales of its Pro and base models. Despite only being released in September 2022, the iPhone 14 Pro Max became the third best-selling smartphone model in 2022.\n\n\"For the first time, a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models,\" Counterpoint Research wrote in its report.\n\n\"The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant. Major advancements in the iPhone 14 Pro series, such as dynamic island and faster processor, make it more attractive, as the base model is almost identical to the previous year's model,\" the research firm added.\n\nApple's iPhone 14 and Pro variants ranked seventh and eighth, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 12, which was the best-selling smartphone of 2021, was also one of the best-selling models in 2022 as it clinched the sixth spot.\n\nThe report noted that iPhone 12 is still popular in the U.S., Japan and China. The model's price cuts and 5G capability also buoyed its sales.\n\nThe two non-Apple products that managed to make it to the top 10 list are the Samsung Galaxy A13 and Samsung Galaxy A03. They ranked fourth and 10th, respectively.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, the Galaxy A13's affordable price and attractive specifications became its top selling point.\n\nOn the other hand, the Galaxy A03 was the only model included in the best-selling list to be powered by UNISOC and was the most affordable of them all.\n\nBoth Samsung Galaxy models registered strong sales in the Caribbean and Latin America.\n\nThe report, however, said the number of active smartphone models dropped to around 3,600 in 2022 from over 4,200 in 2021.\n\nThe research firm said it expects phone makers to continue making their portfolios \"leaner\" this year to avoid cannibalization.\n\nCNBC reported that in 2022, a total of 1.21 billion smartphones were shipped.\n\nResearch firm IDC said the figure was the lowest annual shipment total since 2013.\n\nDue to macroeconomic weakness and soft consumer demand, global smartphone shipments declined in the fourth quarter of 2022, when sales would usually be higher due to holiday shopping, according to IDC.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChinese Phone Makers Emerge From Huawei's Shadow Nokia's New G22 Phone Allows You To Repair Broken Parts Yourself; Comes With Tools Microsoft Begins Offering Bing AI Chatbot To Smartphone, Skype Users",

This comes from Naver, a South Korean publication. ProMotion, for those of you out of the loop, refers to the 120Hz panel. To be more accurate, to 1-120Hz LTPO panel which debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro series.\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max were the first iPhones to offer 120Hz displays, or as Apple refers to them, ProMotion. The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, on the other hand, were the first to offer the AOD function, when it comes to Apple devices, of course.\n\nBased on this report, neither of the two display functionalities will trickle down to base iPhone 15 models. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, on the other hand, will offer them, of course.\n\nApple will, almost certainly, stick with 60Hz displays on the iPhone 15 series. That is not something that the report mentioned, but it's most likely what will happen. Even budget Android phones have 90Hz displays these days, but Apple doesn't seem to care much about that. Granted, Apple does a great job of optimizing its 60Hz panels, and the vast majority of people getting those devices won't care\n\nAll four or five iPhone 15 models will launch in September this year. Why 5? Well, the iPhone 15 Ultra is rumored to be either the fifth phone, or the 'Pro Max' with a different name. It remains to be seen if either of those rumors is accurate.",

Asia checks on iPhone demand were positive and signaled a moderate uptick in China demand, the analysts wrote in today's client note.\n\n\"A clear demand rebound [is] happening in this key region post December despite the uncertain macro backdrop. The months of January and February and early indications around March are steady on the iPhone front for Cupertino globally which is a stark contrast to what we saw in the supply constrained December quarter due to zero COVID China issues,\" they wrote.\n\nWedbush reminded investors that roughly 25% of iPhone owners haven't upgraded their iPhones in over 4 years.\n\n\"With the highly anticipated anniversary edition iPhone 15 set to be launched in the September timeframe the baton handoff from iPhone 14 to iPhone 15 looks to be a steadier transition than some other peak to valley iPhone cycles of the past. We also believe ASPs are bumping up towards a roughly $900 ASP on iPhones which is a noteworthy trend heading into the next iPhone cycle,\" Wedbush analysts further noted.\n\nMoreover, Apple could witness an acceleration in its Services business next year with the analysts projecting that the Service business alone is worth $1.2 trillion-$1.3 trillion.\n\nOn the near-term catalysts for Apple, they highlighted Glass-AR/VR headset launch, hardware subscription plan, more services bundling options, and some new hardware launches on the Mac product.\n\n\"The golden installed base of Apple is creating more stability in this uncertain macro and remains key to our bullish thesis,\" the analysts concluded.\n\nApple stock is moving higher in premarket Wednesday.",

                    "body": "Good news: There's a yellow iPhone 14. Bad news: This probably means Apple has given up on the idea of a spring event in 2023.\n\nWe've suspected this for a while, in fact. Apple originally planned to focus on its long-awaited AR headset in this year's spring event, but the latest round of rumored delays means that's unlikely to happen. (I say \"latest,\" but that's not quite true: even more reported delays mean the headset might not appear until the fall.) In the absence of the headliner, there was always a strong possibility that Apple would pull the event entirely.\n\nThe launch of a new iPhone color, however, elevates the no-event theory from \"strong possibility\" to \"near certainty.\" The last two spring events have seen similar announcements: the Alpine Green iPhone 13 Pro was unveiled at the Peek Performance event in March 2022, while the purple iPhone 12 made its debut at the Spring Loaded event in April 2021. If Apple still planned to hold an event in spring 2023, it would surely wait until it had the world's attention to reveal the yellow iPhone 14. The only possible reason to launch it now would be to trick pundits into thinking there won't be an event... which isn't an impossible theory given Apple's fondness for discrediting leakers but is unlikely.\n\nAfter all, spring events don't happen every year. Sure, there was one last year and the year before, but not in 2020 (though the beginning of the Covid pandemic might have upset Apple's plans for an event that introduced the iPhone SE, 4th-gen iPad Pro, and Magic Keyboard). There were spring events in 2018 and 2019, but not in 2017. We get used to routines, but that doesn't mean they're set in stone. And aside from the logistical hassle, holding an event when you haven't got anything earth-shattering to talk about risks reducing your audience's interest the next time you send out invitations.\n\nMind you, there's a wild card that could render this whole theory moot. Apple is believed to have something quite interesting up its sleeve that could arrive as early as April. This spring's \"surprise,\" if you can use that term for a product that's been leaked as widely as this, is the arrival of the 15-inch MacBook Air and the early arrival of the M3 chip, which was expected in late 2023 or early 2024 but could feasibly appear in April.\n\nJust as the announcement of the yellow iPhone means there probably won't be a spring event, perhaps the lack of a spring event means the MacBook Air either isn't coming yet. Or it's just a larger model and isn't as exciting as we're hoping it is. Or Apple is just messing with us.\n\nBut assuming our calculations are correct, you probably want to start looking at WWDC for your next keynote fix. See you in June, everyone.",

And the larger aperture captures brighter colour and finer detail in low-light scenes.\n\nThe iPhone 14 lineup introduced Photonic Engine, improving mid- to low-light performance for photos across all cameras compared to the previous generation: up to 2x on the TrueDepth and Ultra Wide cameras, and 2.5x on the new main camera. Photonic Engine is able to preserve subtle textures, provide better color, and maintain more information in a photo through a deep integration of hardware and software.\n\nVideo features like Action mode and Cinematic mode are available across the iPhone 14 lineup. Action mode enables smooth-looking video that adjusts to significant shakes and motion -- even when video is being captured in the middle of the action.\n\nMeanwhile, cinematic mode supports 4K at 30 fps and 4K at 24 fps, enabling a beautiful depth-of-field effect that automatically changes focus in a simple and intuitive way to capture cinema-style moments.\n\nPricing and availability\n\nApple iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are currently available in midnight, red, starlight, blue and purple, and will be available in yellow in 128GB, 256GB and 512GB storage capacities, starting at Dhs3,300 and Dhs3,799 respectively.\n\nRead: Apple unveils iPhone 14 with camera upgrades, satellite feature",

                    "body": "On Tuesday, March 7, Apple introduced a sunny new yellow to the iPhone 14 lineup.\n\nThe new colorway is available for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models, which currently come in midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, and purple. (An actual lavender color -- not the fake \"deep purple\" of the iPhone 14 Pro model.)\n\nThere's not that much different from the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus than the iPhone 14 smartphone lineup that was released last September. It's made with an aluminum body and Ceramic Shield screen for durability and scratch resistance and has the same features and specs, including Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via satellite, and an advanced dual-camera system. The yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus also have the same prices as the rest of the lineup, starting at $799 and $899 respectively.\n\nBut now iPhone users looking to cross to the other side of the color wheel finally have that option. It's like holding sunshine in your hand, and Mashable got to experience its luminosity in person.\n\nThe yellow shade is a little brighter than it appears here.A sunny little yellow frame surrounding the front screen.\n\nHands-on with the yellow iPhone 14 Plus, the shade is bright and creamy. Not so yellow that it's blinding, but just enough pop of color to catch your attention.\n\nLike all iPhone 14 models, the frame is just visible around the edge of the front screen, which creates a distinct yet subtle border that's pleasing to the eye. I just got the device, so I haven't had much time with it yet, but one of my first thoughts is whether fingerprint smudges might be be more noticeable. The glass back makes it easy to buff away any grime, but if you're accident-prone, Apple also released new silicone cases in the same yellow shade along with olive, sky, and iris.\n\nWe haven't seen a lot of yellow from the iPhone maker. Way back in 2013, the lower-end iPhone 5c came in a yellow (along with white, pink, blue, and green). Compared to the cartoony iPhone 5c, this yellow is whimsical yet sophisticated, like doing the Sunday edition of the New York Times crossword puzzle or taking salsa classes.\n\nIf that sounds like you, the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus can be pre-ordered starting March 10 with full availability on March 14.",

                    "body": "Yesterday, Apple announced new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus color variants. This is a very bold color and also an interesting decision that brings the total color options for the two low-tier iPhone 14 models to six: midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, purple, and yellow.\n\nIt is in fact interesting, mostly because we did a poll not long ago asking you which color you would like to see in the iPhone 13 lineup, and the yellow option got only 4% of the votes. Things might've changed with the iPhone 14 series, and Apple might know something we don't, so yellow it is.\n\nThat's the reason why we've decided to double check with the current poll. Do you like this new yellow color option? Would you buy one just because of the color? Nowadays, we use our phones mostly with protective cases on, and your only bet to show your phone's true color is a transparent one, so that's another dealbreaker right there.\n\nOn the other hand, last year's Deep Purple was a true hit (and it also ranked pretty high in our poll; it was the second most voted option with 14%), so there's also that. For me personally, the brighter the color, the better. I'm tired of gray, white, and black smartphones.\n\nI remember back in the day tracking down a yellow Xperia Z1 Compact and paying extra just to get that color, so I might be a little biased here. What about you? Vote in our poll and share your opinion on the new yellow iPhone color in the comments below.",

That is, it is possible that new colors for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will also be presented on March 8.\n\nTrue, already today (March 7) Apple has planned a briefing for journalists, so it is likely that the new color will be shown to us within a day.\n\nThe other day, rumors appeared on the Web about the announcement of younger iPhones in yellow, but then the source of the rumors was without a proper reputation. It's possible he was right after all.",

                    "body": "New Delhi: Especially in light of the most recent study from Counterpoint Research, it won't be inaccurate to assert that Apple dominates the smartphone market. According to the report, Apple has taken eight of the top ten slots on the list of best-selling smartphones for 2022. It implies that the Apple iPhone 13 will be the most popular smartphone in the world in 2022.\n\nIt's interesting that only Apple and Samsung smartphones are included on the list. Eight of the ten positions are grabbed by an Apple iPhone, and the final two are by a Samsung camera. The iPhone 13, which was the best-selling smartphone in China, the US, the UK, Germany, and France, holds the top rank. (Also Read: Cyber Fraud: How To Avoid Bank-Related Scams? Follow These Tips)\n\nThe article asserts \"From the time of its release in September 2021 until August 2022, the iPhone 13 remained the top smartphone every single month. Price reductions following the release of the iPhone 14 series helped the iPhone 13's sales in emerging nations even more.\" (Also Read: Twitter Chief Elon Musk Apologises For Mocking Former Disabled Employee In Tweet Storm)\n\nSince its international release, the iPhone 13 has had the most sales of any smartphone. And the discounts that the iPhone 13 has been selling for at Amazon, Flipkart, and other sales are to blame for it. The iPhone 13 currently has a starting price of Rs 69,900 but is offered at a discount on e-commerce sites.\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro Max ranks second on the list, and for the first time, the Pro Max model received more attention than the Pro model. The more recent iPhone 14 Pro is third. For the months of September, October, and November of 2022, it was the most popular smartphone model.\n\nEarly adopters and people upgrading to a more expensive iPhone model drove the sales of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The base model of the iPhone 14 Pro series has undergone significant improvements, such as dynamic island and a quicker processor, making it more appealing, according to the report.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A13, a low-cost Samsung phone, comes in at number four on the list, followed by five more iPhone models: the iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone SE 2022. Last but not least, Samsung has once more taken the tenth position with the Galaxy A03.",

Now the time has come: From Friday, March 10th, you can pre-order the iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus in yellow.\n\nFrom Tuesday, March 14th, the new, yellow iPhones will be available in stores and will be delivered to those who pre-order. Apple announced this today in a press release after basically all the information about it had already leaked out last week.\n\nThe new spring color yellow complements the selection that previously consisted of midnight, polar star, product red, blue, and violet. The prices remain unchanged and start at Apple from 999 euros. In addition to the new iPhone color, other \"heralds of spring\" are starting. There are new Apple Watch bands (e.g. Solo Loops in pastel green, canary yellow, olive, and foggy violet, sport bands in sky, light orange, and olive) and new silicone cases for the entire iPhone 14 series (in canary yellow, olive, sky and iris).\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it for everything they do every day, and now the family is expanding with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing by Apple. \"The exceptional battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, cutting-edge security features like satellite emergency SOS, and everything that iOS 16 has to offer to make the iPhone 14 a great choice when making a new purchase decision iPhone.\"\n\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available with either 128 GB, 256 GB, or 512 GB. Anyone who would like to order the iPhone in yellow can do so from March 10 at 2 p.m. The new iPhones should then be available from March 14th in Apple Stores and local retailers.",

                    "body": "iPhone 15 series is expected to launch later this year The series will likely have a base, Plus, Pro and Pro Max model iPhone 15 Pro Max could also launch as the iPhone 15 Ultra\n\niPhone 15 series is expected to launch later this year, and Apple's upcoming lineup is likely to consist of four models - the standard iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The iPhone 15 Pro Max has been tipped to bear the 'Ultra' moniker this year. While Apple is yet to reveal details of its next generation of smartphones, there have been numerous leaks and reports about the upcoming handsets. A report now claims that Apple will restrict certain features in the upcoming lineup to the more expensive, high-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models.\n\nAccording to details shared by tipster yeux1122 in a post on Naver (via GSMArena), Apple will restrict the high refresh rate and Always-On Display (AOD) functionality to the iPhone 15 Pro models. The tipster has also claimed that Apple is getting ready for mass production for the iPhone 15 series.\n\nThe LTPO displays with a 120Hz refresh rate will be confined to the two Pro models, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, according to the tipster. Apple employed the same strategy with last year's iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, as well as the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021.\n\nA recent report also hinted that the Pro models of the iPhone 15 lineup will come with significantly thinner bezels than its predecessors and will feature more immersive displays than the Dynamic Island which make its way to the non-Pro iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models - a notable upgrade from the iPhone 14 series.\n\nAs the Cupertino-based tech giant earlier promised to follow EU guidelines pertaining to the USB Type-C port usage, the iPhone 15 lineup could be the first of the iPhones to ship with USB Type-C charging ports. According to a recent leak, however, the phones might only support USB Type-C accessories that have the Made for iPhone (MFi) certification. Apple may impose limitations on the charging speed and functionality of unsupported cables, according to the report.",

This is too harsh from the Cupertino giant because high refresh rate OLED displays have gotten cheaper than ever and on every mid-range Android device we get the feature.\n\nAs per tipster yeux1122, Apple is preparing itself for the mass production of its upcoming iPhone 15 series and while Dynamic Island is expected to make its entry to iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, ProMotion will still be restricted for the high-end iPhone 15 Pro series.\n\nConsidering the fact that 120Hz LTPO displays are quite common these days and are inexpensive, Apple has been restricting them from the iPhone 13 Pro series. Now, even in 2023, only iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will get high refresh rate panels, which is again a big shame.",

                    "body": "Apple is the first to capture 8 spots in the list of global top 10 smartphones, as per Counterpoint.\n\niPhones were the best-selling smartphones in the year 2022. According to the Counterpoint Research report, Apple grabbed an astonishing 8 spots in the top 10 best-selling smartphones of the year. The Cupertino-based tech giant also became the first brand to achieve this feat. The remaining spots were taken by its arch-rival, Samsung but surprisingly through budget A-series devices, unlike the premium iPhones. Let's look at the complete list of the best-selling smartphones of 2022, as per Counterpoint.\n\nAccording to the data revealed by Counterpoint Research, Apple occupied 8 spots in the top 10 best-selling smartphones in 2022 and became the first brand to do so. As the information revealed, the iPhone 13 was the best-selling phone from the brand last year. It was the best-selling phone for 8 straight months, second best-selling for a month, and slipped to 4th best-selling in the last three months post the launch of the iPhone 14 series, including the iPhone 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus, in September 2022.\n\nThe second best-selling device from the brand was the top-end variant - iPhone 13 Pro Max. It was the second best-selling device for 8 months after the iPhone 12 but slipped to the 7th spot in September and October and the 11th and 15th spots in November and December 2022, respectively. The iPhone 14 Pro Max launched in September 2022 and was perched on the top spot in September, October, and November. It slipped to the second spot in December.\n\nOther iPhones in the list include iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone SE 2022. These iPhones occupied the spots 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, respectively. The 4th spot went to the Samsung Galaxy A13, and the Galaxy A03 occupied the 10th spot. Notably, these budget smartphones are far more affordable than the premium iPhones on the list.\n\nApple is expected to launch its upcoming iPhone 15 series, with all models featuring Dynamic Island cutout, in September 2022. However, to boost the sale of its base iPhone and iPhone 14 Plus, the tech giant recently launched both these models in a new Yellow colour option. Yellow is the sixth colour option in the non-Pro lineup, joining midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT) RED, blue, and purple.",

                    "body": "What to expect from the displays expected for the iPhone 15 lineup\n\nThe Super Retina XDR display is one of the standout features on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. So naturally, with iPhone 15 rumors picking up in advance of this fall's release, a lot of the speculations surrounding the upcoming phones has zeroed on potential display changes.\n\nFor the most part, there's very little to suggest that the iPhone 15 will see big screen size changes over previous models. Apple has proven it has a winning formula with the standard iPhone and both Pro models, so there's little reason to mix thing up. Still, Apple may be planning some slight differences from the current iPhone 14 lineup. Here's what we know about the iPhone 15 screen sizes so far.\n\nApple's iPhone 15 range could have a lot in common with the current iPhone lineup. Last fall, Apple released four phones in two sizes -- the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro with 6.1-inch screens, and the iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 14 Pro Max, both of which come with 6.7-inch panels.\n\nScreen Size: A 2022 TrendForce report suggests the number of phones isn't going to change this fall. We're expecting an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max when the dust settles this fall. Initial reports -- primarily from leaker ShrimpApplePro (opens in new tab) -- list the same screen sizes as before. If true, that means 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models, plus the two 6.7-inch handsets.\n\nApple could be planning a slight tweak, though. iPhone 15 CADs show that standard model with a 6.2-inch screen (opens in new tab) -- a slight increase from the iPhone 14's screen size. In this scenario, it looks like the iPhone 15 Pro would keep its 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro Max would still have the largest panels at 6.7 inches.\n\nIf you want a hint at what this all might look like a pair of iPhone 15 display leaks purport to show screens for this fall's iPhone lineup. Notably, the screens feature a slightly curved bezel, suggesting that the era of straight-edge iPhones is over.\n\nDynamic Island: Those leaked display images indicate another big change for the iPhone 15 lineup -- Dynamic Island cutouts across the board.\n\nBoth the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max replaced the iPhone's notch with the Dynamic Island, a cut-out for the front camera and FaceID sensors that also doubles as a home for notifications and alerts. Apparently, that feature will come to all four iPhone 15 models, not just the Pro offerings.\n\nDynamic Island is one of our favorite iPhone 14 Pro features. It creates a more seamless and immersive display, and we like how iOS 16's Live Activities feature makes use of the space around the Dynamic Island. This should prove to be a great addition to the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus if the rumors are accurate.\n\nBrightness: The iPhone 15 Pro Max is tipped to get a 2,500-nit display, further differentiating Apple's high-end phone from the rest of the models. That would make the iPhone 15 Pro Max the brightest phone display ever, beating the 2,000-nit iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max as well as the 1,750-nit Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.\n\nRefresh rate: Since the iPhone 13 releases in 2021, the Pro models have featured an adaptive refresh rate, scaling up to 120Hz when on-screen activity would benefit from smoother scrolling or more immersive graphics. Other phones continue to feature a 60Hz refresh rate, putting them behind other flagship phones with faster refresh rates.\n\nApple seems committed to differentiating its Pro phones from the rest of the lineup, so we don't have much hope that refresh rates will improve for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Apple could always let those phones scale up to 90Hz like Google does for the Pixel 7, but that's wishful thinking at this point.\n\nInitial iPhone 15 rumors talked up another possible model -- the iPhone 15 Ultra. This device wouldn't just be a rebranded version of the iPhone 15 Pro Max; instead Bloomberg's (opens in new tab) Mark Gurman suggests that the Ultra could have \"a faster chip, and perhaps an even larger display,\" setting it apart from Apple's iPhone Pro handsets.\n\nHow much larger isn't clear right now, but if it's greater than 6.7 inches, that would be Apple's largest phone ever. Outside of the Galaxy S23 Ultra and its 6.8-inch display, you'd have to turn to a foldable phone to find more display real estate.\n\nSuch hefty display would no doubt add some extra weight to the iPhone 15 Ultra, which seems contrary to Apple's usual philosophy. That said there have been rumors the iPhone 15 Ultra could feature a titanium body, which could offset this weight -- and potentially offer greater strength in the process.\n\nBut before you get excited about the potential of an iPhone Ultra joining the rest of the iPhone 15 lineup, you may be in for a bit of a wait. Gurman believes that an iPhone Ultra model won't arrive until next year instead. So we'll just have to wait for the iPhone 16 family if we want an even larger iPhone display.",

The bright color scheme is one of the latest addition to the iPhone 14 lineup after the 'Alpine Green' and 'Green' finishes were first introduced with the iPhone 13. The new colorway was created to pique the interest of aesthetic-driven consumers looking for a phone shade that matches their unique taste. Both versions include the longest-lasting batteries in iPhone history, a tough Ceramic Shield front shell, and new internal architecture for improved performance and maintenance.\n\nA new 12MP primary camera, an Ultra Wide camera for even more unusual viewpoints, and a new front TrueDepth camera are all part of a sophisticated dual-camera system. Users can also access safety features such as Collision Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite.\n\nThe current color options for Apple's iPhone 14 and 14 Plus include 'Midnight,' 'Blue,' 'Starlight,' 'Purple,' and '(PRODUCT)RED.'\n\nImage Credit: Apple, hypebeast, apple",

                    "body": "Just launched, Apple's new pale yellow iPhone 14 fits in well with their other current colour options - midnight, starlight, red, blue and purple.\n\nSmartHouse tipped you off that this announcement was probably on the cards, along with news about upcoming new iMacs. Now it's refreshing to see the phone has a nice Spring feel to it, to fit in with the season in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe colour will be available for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, but not the iPhone 14 Pro models.\n\nSome are calling the new shade daffodil yellow, while pointing out that the March 10 release fits into what seems to have become a tradition for Apple, who released the Alpine Green version of the iPhone 13 (above) around the same time last year, on March 8. The purple iPhone 12 was launched in April the year before.\n\nThat suggests that if you're after the iPhone 15 next year you might want to hold off on an impulse buy until you see what new colour jumps out come the northern spring.",

                    "body": "A recent market research report highlights 2022 as a successful year for Apple, with the Cupertino-based tech giant leading worldwide smartphone shipments. In the report, eight of Apple's smartphone models made it to the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones. The iPhone 13, which was launched in 2021, secured the first position as the best-selling model, while the iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max followed at second and third positions, respectively. Other Apple models in the list include the iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone SE (2022). Meanwhile, Samsung secured two spots on the top-10 list with entry-level Galaxy A series smartphones.\n\nAccording to the latestCounterpoint Research's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker report by market research firm Counterpoint Research, the iPhone 13 was the best-selling phone of 2022. Launched in 2021, the smartphone, powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chip, accounted for 28% of iPhone sales. The surge in demand for the older iPhone 13 series model is attributed to price cuts following the launch of the iPhone 14 series in September 2021. The iPhone 13 was the top-selling smartphone in several countries, including China, France, Germany, the US, and the UK.\n\nThe report also revealed that the iPhone 13 Pro Max ranked second on the list of best-selling smartphones in 2022, while the recently launched iPhone 14 Pro Max secured third place. The report further stated that Pro Max models in the iPhone series sold more units than their Pro and base counterparts in 2022. Samsung's Galaxy A13, a budget-friendly smartphone, secured the fourth position on the list, with the iPhone 13 Pro coming in fifth place.\n\nAs per the Counterpoint Research's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker report, the iPhone 12 occupied the sixth position, while the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro came in at seventh and eighth positions, respectively. The budget-friendly iPhone SE (2022) secured the ninth spot, and Samsung's Galaxy A03 rounded out the top ten. The entry-level Galaxy A13 from Samsung was ranked fourth, and the iPhone 13 Pro came in a close fifth position. The report indicates that the Pro Max version of an iPhone series accounted for a larger portion of sales than the Pro and base models in 2022. Apple has become the first brand to capture eight spots on the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones, with the iPhone 13 being the best-selling model.\n\nThe report also adds that there is an expectation that the top 10 smartphones will increase their share in 2023 as brands focus on clearing inventory and optimising their launches. The research firm predicts that brands will make their portfolios leaner this year to minimise cannibalisation.",

                    "body": "On Tuesday, March 7, Apple introduced a sunny new yellow to the iPhone 14 lineup.\n\nThe new colorway is available for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models, which currently come in midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, and purple. (An actual lavender color -- not the fake \"deep purple\" of the iPhone 14 Pro model.)\n\nThere's not that much different from the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus than the iPhone 14 smartphone lineup that was released last September. It's made with an aluminum body and Ceramic Shield screen for durability and scratch resistance and has the same features and specs, including Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via satellite, and an advanced dual-camera system. The yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus also have the same prices as the rest of the lineup, starting at US$799 and US$899 respectively.\n\nBut now iPhone users looking to cross to the other side of the color wheel finally have that option. It's like holding sunshine in your hand, and Mashable got to experience its luminosity in person.\n\nThe yellow shade is a little brighter than it appears here. A sunny little yellow frame surrounding the front screen.\n\nHands-on with the yellow iPhone 14 Plus, the shade is bright and creamy. Not so yellow that it's blinding, but just enough pop of color to catch your attention.\n\nLike all iPhone 14 models, the frame is just visible around the edge of the front screen, which creates a distinct yet subtle border that's pleasing to the eye. I just got the device, so I haven't had much time with it yet, but one of my first thoughts is whether fingerprint smudges might be be more noticeable. The glass back makes it easy to buff away any grime, but if you're accident-prone, Apple also released new silicone cases in the same yellow shade along with olive, sky, and iris.\n\nWe haven't seen a lot of yellow from the iPhone maker. Way back in 2013, the lower-end iPhone 5c came in a yellow (along with white, pink, blue, and green). Compared to the cartoony iPhone 5c, this yellow is whimsical yet sophisticated, like doing the Sunday edition of the New York Times crossword puzzle or taking salsa classes.\n\nIf that sounds like you, the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus can be pre-ordered starting March 10 with full availability on March 14.\n\nHey!

                    "body": "Folks, pay no attention to the beautiful, bright yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. They're a distraction -- bad deals covered in fun colors. And Apple knows it.\n\nI was the proud owner of a yellow iPhone XR for four years, and I loved that darn device. I'm obsessed with color -- it affects my mood and it's a key part of my personal expression -- so a yellow iPhone added a lot to my life. It made me happy to look at every day, elevated my style, and was easy to find in even the messiest gym bag.\n\nI was really bummed when I needed to replace that phone earlier this year. No yellow option was available for the iPhone 14 line, though I was tempted by the soft blue and light lavender of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. The iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Max were limited to silver, gold, deep purple, and space black -- snore! -- and were more expensive.\n\nGiven that I've asked Apple for a hot pink iPhone, it may surprise you that I resisted the temptation for a bright color and bought an iPhone 14 Pro in plain old gold. When Apple announced its new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus this morning, I wondered if I had made a mistake.\n\nBut I know the Pro was the right decision for my wallet, and that it might be right for yours, too.\n\nCompare, for example, the 128 GB iPhone 14 and 128 GB iPhone 14 Pro. The main differences between the two phones are their color options, an extra camera lens, and about $200: the $799 iPhone 14 offers two lenses, while the $999 iPhone 14 Pro offers three.\n\nYears ago, each new iPhone release came with camera technology leaps and bounds above the previous iteration. But progress has slowed down since then, and the camera tech improvement in new iPhones is incremental. So when one device has two lenses and another offers three, that's a huge difference in value.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and Max may be more expensive in the short run, but they'll be cheaper in the long run. By buying an iPhone with three lenses, you'll keep your device from becoming obsolete more quickly.\n\nBut Apple knows that sometimes, a color calls to you. That's why they make their cheaper offerings bright, bold, and, for someone like me, almost irresistible. Unless that phone is hot pink...then, Apple, you might get me to fall for it.\n\nHey!

                    "body": "The iPhone manufacturer Apple has captured eight spots on the list of the 10 best-selling smartphones of last year, according to a report by Counterpoint Research.\n\nCupertino, California-based Apple dominated the list, taking the top three spots. The iPhone 13 was the best-selling model, followed by the iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nThe iPhone 13, which was launched in September 2021, contributed about 28 per cent of total iPhone sales last year, Counterpoint said. However, the research company did not release the number of units sold.\n\nIt was the best-selling smartphone in major markets such as China, the US, the UK, Germany and France, and about twice as many were sold as the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the second best-selling smartphone of last year.\n\n\"Price cuts after the iPhone 14 series' launch [in September last year] further drove the iPhone 13 volumes in developing markets,\" said Harshit Rastogi, research analyst at Counterpoint.\n\n\"The iPhone 14 Pro Max was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October and November of 2022.\n\n\"The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant.\n\n\"Major advancements in the iPhone 14 Pro series, such as dynamic island and faster processor, make it more attractive, as the base model [iPhone 14] is almost identical to the previous year's model.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple announced a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, adding more colour choices to its latest line-up.\n\nThe top 10 smartphones contributed 19 per cent of total global smartphone sales last year, the same as in 2021.\n\nThe remaining two spots were taken by Samsung Galaxy A13 (fourth) and Galaxy A03 (10th).\n\n\"With its entry-level models Galaxy A13 and Galaxy A03, Samsung took two spots on the list, one more than the previous year [2021],\" Mr Rastogi said.\n\n\"Offering attractive specifications for its price [less than $250], the Galaxy A13 continued to perform well. [The] Caribbean and Latin America, followed by India, contributed the most to its sales.\"\n\nThe Galaxy A03 was the least expensive smartphone on the list and it performed well in developing regions such as the Caribbean and Latin America as well as the Middle East and Africa.\n\nApple is in a battle for dominance in the global smartphone market with South Korean company Samsung and Chinese brand Xiaomi.\n\nSamsung led the industry with a market share of about 21.6 per cent last year and produced 260.9 million handsets during the period, according to Massachusetts-based research company International Data Corporation.\n\nIt was followed by Apple, which produced 226.4 million handsets and had a market share of 18.8 per cent, and Xiaomi, with 153.1 million handsets and a market share of 12.7 per cent.\n\nHowever, in the fourth quarter of last year, Samsung was relegated to the number-two spot by the iPhone maker. Apple sold 72.3 million iPhones and accounted for a 24.1 per cent market share in the last quarter, while Samsung sold 58.2 million phones and had a 19.4 per cent market share.\n\n\"We believe the share of the top 10 smartphones will increase in 2023 as brands focus on clearing inventory and optimising their launches ... we also expect brands to continue making their portfolios leaner in 2023 to minimise cannibalisation,\" Mr Rastogi said.\n\nThe number of active smartphone models on the global market dropped to 3,600 last year from more than 4,200 in 2021.",

                    "body": "Apple unveiled its iPhone 14 series last year and now the tech giant has announced that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models are available in a new yellow colour variant. However, there are no other updates or changes to the iPhone 14 lineup, and the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models have not received any new colour options. Apple has a history of introducing new colours to its iPhone series, with the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro getting new colours a year ago, and the iPhone 12 lineup also receiving a new colour option the year before that. Reports had previously hinted at Apple launching the new yellow colour option for the iPhone 14 non-Pro models.\n\nPreviously, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models were available in five different colours - Blue, Midnight, Purple, Starlight, and (Product) RED. However, the new addition of the Yellow colour option has expanded the range. Both models come with three storage configurations - 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. In India, the starting price for the base model of the iPhone 14 is Rs. 79,900, while the iPhone 14 Plus starts at Rs. 89,900.\n\nBoth the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with distinct display sizes, with the former boasting a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, and the latter showcasing a larger 6.7-inch screen. Both devices are equipped with Apple's powerful A15 Bionic chipset and operate on the latest iOS 16 operating system.\n\nIn terms of camera specifications, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus come equipped with a dual rear camera setup comprising a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera that features a 1.9um sensor and an f/1.7 aperture lens. Additionally, both models feature a 12-megapixel sensor coupled with an ultra-wide-angle lens that has an f/2.4 aperture and a 120-degree field of view. According to Apple, the front-facing camera on both models is a 12-megapixel TrueDepth camera that comes with an f/1.9 aperture lens.\n\nApple has improved the video recording capabilities of both iPhone 14 models as compared to their predecessors, as the company claims. They come equipped with an advanced stabilisation feature called \"Action Mode\", which utilises the phone's motion sensors to improve video correction. Additionally, the handsets boast an updated Cinematic mode that can now record 4K videos at both 30 and 24 frames per second. Furthermore, Apple has enhanced the low-light performance of these models with the help of the new Photonic Engine.\n\nAccording to Apple's claims, the low-light performance of the ultra-wide camera has improved by up to two times, while the front-facing TrueDepth camera's low-light performance has also improved by two times. The main camera's low-light performance, on the other hand, has reportedly gotten better by up to 2.5 times. Additionally, Apple has stated that the True Tone flash has been enhanced and is now 10 per cent brighter.\n\nWhile Apple has not officially confirmed the battery specifications of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models, the company claims that the base model can provide a video playback time of up to 20 hours, while the Plus model can deliver a video playback time of up to 26 hours.",

                    "body": "Just today, Apple announced a bold new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. But the iPhones themselves are not the only things that are becoming more colorful. The accessories have followed suit.\n\nApple has just launched silicon cases in a plethora of interesting shades, including Canary Yellow (to match the new iPhone), Olive, Sky and Iris. This means that users now have a grand total of 10 color options to choose from.\n\nAdditionally, if rumors are to be believed, we can expect Apple leather covers in new shades as well. According to a tweet by Majin Buu that was subsequently covered by MacRumors in a dedicated article, two new shades will be introduced shortly - Golden Brown and Deep Violet.\n\nThe former is a fairly standard color in Apple's accessories portfolio, but the latter is what many users are likely to be excited about. It will be a perfect match for this year's exclusive color option for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max - Deep Purple.\n\nUnfortunately, no official Apple case thus far (beside the clear one) has been a good fit for it. The thing is, Deep Purple is not only a very unique shade, it is also very popular amongst buyers. This makes the new leather cover all the more exciting.\n\nIt goes without saying that all accessories that we have mentioned come with MagSafe and are of impeccable quality. They are also, unfortunately, rather expensive. If you are not willing to splurge on Apple's cases, there are many good alternatives out there. But if money is not a concern and you are looking for a premium feel, they are definitely worth a look.",

                    "body": "Apple announced it would release a new color for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus: yellow.\n\nThat means you can choose six colors for your new Apple smartphone: purple, blue, starlight, midnight, Product Red, and the new yellow.\n\nYou may preorder the yellow iPhone 14 on March 10, but it will become available on March 14.\n\nBob Borchers, Apple's VP of Worldwide Product Marketing, shared a few words about the flagship product's new color:\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do. Now, there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\"\n\nAside from the new color, the 14 and 14 Plus have the same specs featured in the 2022 Apple Event.\n\nThe iPhone 14 camera has two interesting features: Action and Cinematic mode. Action mode adjusts the camera's shakes and motions to ensure stable recording.\n\nFor example, let us say you want to take a video of your child running a marathon. Consequently, you must run to focus the camera on your kid.\n\nActivate Action Mode, and your footage will steadily focus on your son or daughter. On the other hand, aspiring moviemakers may appreciate Cinematic mode.\n\nIt lets the iPhone 14 camera focus on different layers of a shot. For example, it may focus on a person and then blur the subject to focus on the background instead.\n\nIt could help filmmakers shoot scenes for drama movies or other stories that highlight character interactions.\n\nLastly, the iPhone 14 uses satellites to send emergency SOS messages so that people can call for help in areas with low or no signal coverage.\n\nApple announced it would release yellow iPhone 14 units on March 14, 2023. Fortunately, Filipino users can preorder and go for yellow.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of a yellow iPhone 14 starts at \u20b156,990, while the iPhone 14 Plus starts at \u20b163,990.",

                    "body": "We may earn a commission if you make a purchase from the links on this page. In the last couple of years, color is becoming an ever more prevalent part of Apple's iPhone ecosystem. What was previously an ultra minimalistic black and white aesthetic is now a lively rainbow, with more and more colors to choose from.\n\nJust today, Apple announced a bold new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. But the iPhones themselves are not the only things that are becoming more colorful. The accessories have followed suit.\n\nApple has just launched silicon cases in a plethora of interesting shades, including Canary Yellow (to match the new iPhone), Olive, Sky and Iris. This means that users now have a grand total of 10 color options to choose from.\n\nAdditionally, if rumors are to be believed, we can expect Apple leather covers in new shades as well. According to a tweet by Majin Buu that was subsequently covered by MacRumors in a dedicated article, two new shades will be introduced shortly - Golden Brown and Deep Violet.\n\nThe former is a fairly standard color in Apple's accessories portfolio, but the latter is what many users are likely to be excited about. It will be a perfect match for this year's exclusive color option for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max - Deep Purple.\n\nUnfortunately, no official Apple case thus far (beside the clear one) has been a good fit for it. The thing is, Deep Purple is not only a very unique shade, it is also very popular amongst buyers. This makes the new leather cover all the more exciting.\n\nIt goes without saying that all accessories that we have mentioned come with MagSafe and are of impeccable quality. They are also, unfortunately, rather expensive. If you are not willing to splurge on Apple's cases, there are many good alternatives out there. But if money is not a concern and you are looking for a premium feel, they are definitely worth a look.",

                    "body": "According to new research by Counterpoint Research, a data analyst firm, the iPhone took eight of the top ten spots when it came to global smartphone sales last year. At the top of the list was the iPhone 13, which was released in September 2021. Interestingly, even while being the top-selling smartphone for the entire year, the non-pro iPhone 13 only took up about five percent of smartphone sales.\n\nThe iPhone 13 made up around 28% percent of iPhone sales for the year. The report says that \"price cuts after the iPhone 14 series' launch further drove the iPhone 13 volumes in developing markets\" and that \"iPhone 13 sales were two times more than that of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the second best-selling smartphone in 2022.\"\n\nRight behind the iPhone 13 Pro Max was the iPhone 14 Pro Max. For the rest of the Apple part of the list, it went the iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone SE. The report also noted that, \"for the first time, a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models in 2022\" and that it was actually the top-selling model altogether since its launch in September 2022.\n\nSamsung was the only other company on the top ten list. The Galaxy A13 took 4th and the Galaxy A03 took 10th.\n\nFor 2023, Counterpoint Research predicts that the top 10 smartphones will continue to make up even more total market share, due to companies offering fewer models than in previous years. It notes that a decrease in available models is already happening, with \"the number of active smartphone models in the global market has already fallen from over 4,200 in 2021 to around 3,600 in 2022.\"",

                    "body": "Apple's popular iPhone lineup is once again a top seller when it comes to global smartphone sales. The Cupertino firm's array of devices occupied 8 of the top 10 slots in the 2022 global smartphone sales rankings.\n\nThe iPhone has long proved popular among smartphone buyers, as it regularly snags top slots on smartphone sales lists. 2022 was no exception. Models from Apple's iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone SE lineups took 8 spots on the Counterpoint Research list of the Global Top 10 Smartphones.\n\nThe list is based on data from Counterpoint Research's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker. The iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max took spots 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nThe iPhone 13 took a 5% share of the market in 2022, followed by 2.6% for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, then 1.7% for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The iPhone 13 Pro's 1.6% share was good for fifth place with 1.6%, the iPhone 12 took sixth with 1.5%, the iPhone 14 snagged seventh with 1.4%, and the iPhone 14 Pro was eighth with 1.2% of sales. The 2022 iPhone SE rounded out Apple's top slots by taking ninth place with 1.1% of sales.\n\nThe iPhone 12 was the oldest model in the 2022 top 10 list. The device was the top-selling smartphone in 2021. The iPhone 12 continued to sell well in Japan, the US, and China. Counterpoint Research says the device benefited from price cuts after the iPhone 13 lineup debuted and its 5G capabilities continued to make it an attractive device.\n\nThe iPhone SE 2022, grabbed the tenth spot, managing to sell well in Japan.\n\n\"We believe the share of the top 10 smartphones will increase in 2023 as brands focus on clearing inventory and optimizing their launches,\"\n\n\"We also expect brands to continue making their portfolios leaner in 2023 to minimize cannibalization. The number of active smartphone models in the global market has already fallen from over 4,200 in 2021 to around 3,600 in 2022.\"\n\nAlthough we'll likely see this continue in the 2023 smartphone market, Apple is expected to continue to offer its complete iPhone product range.",

The purple iPhone 12 was launched in April the year before.\n\nThat suggests that if you're after the iPhone 15 next year you might want to hold off on an impulse buy until you see what new colour jumps out come the northern spring.",

                    "title": "Only two Android devices made it to best-selling charts in 2022",
                    "body": "According to research firm Counterpoint, only two Android devices made it among the top ten best-selling smartphones globally in 2022. Those were Samsung's budget handsets Galaxy A03 and Galaxy A13. The remaining eight spots were taken by Apple's iPhones, with the iPhone 13 topping the chart.\n\nApple usually dominates these charts and that isn't surprising. Since the company only launches a handful of models every year, people looking to buy iPhones don't have many choices. They end up buying one of the recent iPhone models, thus driving volumes. On the other hand, the sheer amount of options in the Android space means there's no default choice here. Whatever might be your budget or requirements, you'll always find several models fitting all criteria.\n\nIt has been this way for several years now and it isn't changing anytime soon. In fact, Apple is increasingly benefitting from the growing competition in the Android space. It had eight iPhone models in the top ten best-selling smartphones chart for the first time last year. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro Max were the monthly leaders from January to August, i.e. until the iPhone 14 series came along. The iPhone 14 Pro Max was the crowd favorite for the next three months, with the iPhone 14 topping the chart in December.\n\nOverall, the iPhone 13 accounted for five percent of all smartphones sold last year. It was followed by the iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max. The Samsung Galaxy A13 sits in the fourth spot, followed by the iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone SE 2022, and Galaxy A03. Counterpoint says the latest iPhone Pro Max model sold in more numbers than the Pro and base models for the first time.\n\n\"Major advancements in the iPhone 14 Pro series, such as dynamic island and faster processor, make it more attractive, as the base model is almost identical to the previous year's model,\" the research firm explains. In the Android space, Samsung's Galaxy A13, which is the successor to 2021's best-selling smartphone Galaxy A12, was a popular choice in the Caribbean, Latin America, and India.\n\nThe top ten best-selling smartphones accounted for almost 19 percent of total shipments last year. Counterpoint estimates this share to grow in 2023. That's because Android OEMs are shrinking their smartphone portfolios. Around 3,600 smartphones were active in the global market in 2022, down over 14 percent from more than 4,200 in 2021. This number may go further down this year. \"Brands will focus on their portfolios' premiumization to translate volumes into profitability,\" Counterpoint states.",

                    "body": "Apple has increased the battery replacement price for out-of-warranty iPhone models by $20. Although the company already announced the change in January 2023, all users might not know about it. Apple announced the hiked battery replacement fee for the iPhone 14 at launch, and now other models are meeting the same fate.\n\nEffective March 1, 2023, the battery replacement cost of iPhone models with Face ID, including the iPhone X, iPhone 11, iPhone 12, and the iPhone 13, has gone up from $69 to $89. For iPhone models with Touch ID, like the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 6, the price is set at $69, up from $49. The only models that stick to the old pricing are the vanilla iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c, for which the company still charges $49 for battery service. The last time Apple changed these prices was more than four years ago, in 2019.\n\nSCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\nPrice Hike Doesn't Affect AppleCare+ Users\n\nWhile it is great that the company is providing battery replacement for older models like iPhone 6 and iPhone 7, increasing the price could make the service less accessible for many users. Meanwhile, the cost of getting a new battery for the iPhone 14 remains the same, i.e., $99, which is applicable to all variants in the lineup. It is important to note that those who have AppleCare+ for their iPhones won't have to pay extra for the battery service, even after the price increase.\n\nHowever, there's a catch, and it's a big one. Even though AppleCare+ subscribers might feel that their phone's battery life has reduced significantly, Apple's service centers won't replace it until the battery health falls under 80 percent. As the official website mentions, AppleCare+ for the regular iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12 costs $7.99 per month or a one-time payment of $149 for two years in the United States. Apple's insurance plan for the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is available at $9.99 per month or $199 for two years.\n\nThe surge in prices for iPhone batteries could encourage more people to get AppleCare+, as it reduces the cost for other hardware repairs, such as broken screen, rear glass, and further accidental damage, to a reasonable extent. Apple has also hiked the battery service fee for MacBook Air and iPads by $30 and $20, respectively. Apart from the retail service, Apple customers can also order the self-service repair kit. The iPhone 13 battery bundle costs $91, and if users return their old battery to the company, they get a credit of $46.28, bringing the effective price down to $44.72.\n\nMore: Clean Energy Charging On iPhone: What It Means & How To Turn It Off\n\nSource: Apple",

                    "body": "Apple first debuted the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus in five different colors, but the company refreshed the lineup with a new yellow option in March 2023.\n\nBuyers looking for a new iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus have a new color to choose from, expanding the lineup to six colors. Apple initially debuted the iPhone 14 lineup back in September 2022 in five different colors: midnight, starlight, product red, blue, and purple. However, Apple has a trend of refreshing its product lines with new colorways in the spring of each year. Sometimes this coincides with a spring event, but the announcements can also come quietly through a press release and website refresh. This year, the company chose the latter method.\n\nSCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\nApple's spring colorway for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus is a bright yellow that's noticeably different from the other yellow currently sold by the company. The iPhone 14's yellow is lighter than the yellow iMac, which has a much deeper and darker tone. It's closer in color to the yellow found on the 10th-generation iPad, but the iPad still has a bolder hue than the iPhone 14. In fact, the yellow iPhone 14 might be most similar to the new Volt Yellow color on the Beats Fit Pro. While more subdued than Apple's latest earbuds, the iPhone 14's yellow has a neon hue that is a blend between bright and pastel.\n\nHow To Order The Yellow iPhone 14 & 14 Plus\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus is available for pre-order starting March 10 on Apple's website or the Apple Store app. It'll be available to the public starting March 14, just a few days after pre-orders open. Since the release is only a minor color refresh, it's likely that there will be yellow iPhones 14 and 14 Plus available in-store for purchase on March 14. Both models remain at their current price point for the yellow color: $799 for the iPhone 14 and $899 for the iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nBefore the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus color debuted, Apple increased the trade-in values available to users with older products. Now, prospective buyers can get up to $600 store credit toward a new product, depending on the product that is swapped. Essentially, this means that people looking to buy the yellow iPhone 14 can do so for a considerably lower cost if they trade in their current iPhone.\n\nThough the iPhone 14 comes in six fresh colors, it is still similar to the iPhone 13 under the hood. For that reason, it might be best to take a look at buying an iPhone 13 at a lower cost.\n\nMore: Should You Buy An iPhone 13 In 2023: Why It Is (& Isn't) A Good Purchase\n\nSource: Apple",

                    "body": "Apple's iPhone SE 4 could use OLED screens from a Chinese supplier instead of Samsung or LG. The report comes from South Korean publication The Elec, which says BOE (Beijing Oriental Electronics) is likely to supply the display panels for Apple's next entry-level iPhone that is expected to debut in 2024.\n\nThe Chinese supplier was also expected to provide display panels for the iPhone 15 but reportedly failed to deliver the initial batch of screens according to Apple's specifications, resulting in a mass cancellation of the order. The company is now only expected to supply screens for the iPhone SE 4; iPhone 15 orders are likely to be passed on to Samsung and LG.\n\nThe report adds that the iPhone SE 4 is expected to have a 6.1-inch OLED screen that could cost Apple around $40 a pop. If that's accurate, it would be less that half the $100 price that Apple paid for the LTPO OLED panels used in the iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nThe total number of OLED panel shipments for the iPhone SE 4 are estimated to be around 20 million.\n\nApple uses OLED panels in all its mainstream iPhones, with the iPhone SE (2022) being the only one to still use an LCD screen. That is expected to change this year, with Apple tipped to transition to OLED for its entire iPhone lineup, including the budget model. However, to save costs, the iPhone SE 4 is said to get the same panels that were used in the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14.\n\nIf that assertion holds up, it would mean that the device would get a 6.1-inch OLED screen with 2,532 x 1,170 pixel resolution and a 60Hz refresh rate. This would be in line with analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's recent suggestion that the new iPhone SE will be similar to the iPhone 14. In addition, the iPhone SE 4 is also tipped to sport Apple's in-house 5G baseband chip as Apple tries to reduce its dependence on third-party suppliers.\n\nPermalink to story.",

                    "body": "By Sneha Saha: It won't be wrong to say that Apple is ruling the smartphone space, especially after Counterpoint Research's latest report. As per the report, Apple has captured 8 out of 10 spots in the top-selling smartphone list for 2022. It suggests that Apple iPhone 13 is the top-selling smartphone in 2022 globally.\n\nInterestingly, the list only includes phones from Apple and Samsung. Out of 10 spots, 8 are taken by Apple iPhone while the remaining two are captured by Samsung. The top spot is taken by iPhone 13, which was the best-selling smartphone in China, US, UK, Germany and France. The report states that \"the iPhone 13 remained the number one smartphone each month from its launch in September 2021 till August 2022. Price cuts after the iPhone 14 series' launch further drove the iPhone 13 volumes in developing markets.\"\n\nThe iPhone 13 has been the best-selling smartphone since its launch globally. And the credit for that goes to the discounts that the iPhone 13 has been selling at Amazon, Flipkart, and other sales. The iPhone 13 currently starts at Rs 69,900, but on e-commerce platforms, the phone is available at a discounted price.\n\nSecond on the list is the iPhone 13 Pro Max, and this is the first time that a Pro Max model gained more attention than its Pro model. Third comes the newer iPhone 14 Pro. \"It was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October, and November of 2022. The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant. Major advancements in the iPhone 14 Pro series, such as dynamic island and faster processor, make it more attractive, as the base model is almost identical to the previous year's model,\" the report states.\n\nFourth on the list is a budget Samsung phone called the Samsung Galaxy A13 and then comes 5 more iPhones, including the iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone SE 2022. Lastly, the tenth slot is taken by Samsung again and it is the Galaxy A03.",

                    "body": "By Abhik Sengupta: The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 have a new Yellow colour variant in India and other global markets. The new colour option sits with the existing midnight, starlight, red, blue, and purple shades. The new colour option has the same specifications as the siblings. The price of the new variant in India also remains unchanged.\n\nThe new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus' yellow colour variants prices in India start at Rs 79,900 and Rs 89,900 respectively. The duo will be available in 256GB and 512GB storage variants as well. The sale of the new colour option will begin on March 14.\n\nHowever, customers can also pre-book the device on March 10.\n\nAdditionally, Apple is also offering iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus silicone cases in four new colours: Canary yellow, olive, sky, and iris.\n\nApart from the difference in screen size and battery capacity, the specifications of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are the same.\n\nThe vanilla model comes with a 6.1-inch OLED display, while the Plus model features a 6.7-inch display. Apple ditched the company's iPhone mini model over the Plus variant last year.\n\nOtherwise, both phones are powered by the A15 Bionic SoC (system-over-chip), which includes a 5-core GPU and 6-core CPU. In contrast, the A15 Bionic SoC on the iPhone 13 includes a 6-core CPU and 4-core GPU. With extra cores, CPUs and GPUs offer more efficient performance without consuming power.\n\nDespite differences in the display sizes, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus support Dolby Vision and have ceramic shield protection. The two phones come with two 12-megapixel cameras (wide and ultra-wide) on the back, and the front also includes a 12-megapixel camera sensor. All cameras can record 4K video at 60fps.\n\nApple says the iPhone 14 lineup introduces a \"Photonic Engine\" for improved low-light photography. Users can also enjoy Action and Cinematic video modes.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus variants for Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the UK, and the US also support satellite connectivity to let users message in areas with zero cellular connectivity. The feature remains unavailable in India as it requires special government approval.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus also come with crash detection, which uses specialised components paired with Apple-designed algorithms to detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services when a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.",

                    "body": "There were whispers about Apple coming out with a new yellow iPhone 14, and lo and behold, the rumors were true. Today, the Cupertino-based tech giant announced the new colorway for the standard iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nThe Laptop Mag team had the opportunity to inspect the new iPhone 14 phones wrapped in the polarizing banana-yellow finish, and truth be told, we weren't moved. No, it's not hideous, but its Pikachu-esque hue didn't garner a warm reception from the office either.\n\nWe took this funky yellow phone out for a spin in Bryant Park, and interestingly, we discovered something quite disappointing about this device that makes the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max a better buy over the standard variant.\n\nAs mentioned, I took to Bryant Park to give the new yellow iPhone 14 a glamorous photoshoot. Although the Laptop Mag team is indifferent to the new color, we all agreed that the shiny yellow finish complements the golden flat edge that wraps around the display.\n\nDuring the photoshoot, I felt that the display was too dim (it intensified the unsightly glare), so I pulled down the Action Center to turn up the brightness. To my surprise, the brightness was already maxed out.\n\nFour months ago, we tested an iPhone 14 review unit shortly after its release. Whether adaptive brightness was on or off, the display peaked at 758 nits. For comparison, the iPhone 13's brightness can climb to 795 nits and the iPhone 14 Pro tops out at a whopping 1,448 nits! On the Android side, we've seen the Samsung Galaxy S23 get as bright as 1,158 nits! The typical smartphone delivers 879 nits of brightness, and unfortunately, the iPhone 14 drops below this figure. If ain't over 1,000, I don't want it!\n\nAs such, if you want a phone that you can actually see during a sunny day, opting for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max may be your best bet. (And if the iPhone 14 Pro Max is too pricey for you, here are 5 phones that are cheaper and arguably better.)\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max, for example, can climb to an incredible 1,565 nits. Plus, it has much better battery life (13 hours and 7 minutes) as opposed to the iPhone 14's measly 9-hour runtime.",

                    "body": "While the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are expected to gain the Dynamic Island this year, there are still apparently two display features they'll miss out on. According to a new report on the Korean blog website Naver, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will not feature Always-On display or ProMotion features.\n\nThis report comes from the account \"yuex1122,\" which cites a \"domestic display industry source.\" This account has accurately shared information about unreleased Apple devices in the past. This particular claim also aligns with what was reported last September by the reliable analyst Ross Young.\n\nToday's post says from this source says (translated):\n\nApple has already completed preparations for the delivery of the iPhone 15 series display panel to domestic companies, and it is said that it will confirm details sooner or later and prepare for mass production. What is confirmed here is that only the Pro series supports the LTPO 120 refresh rate, and the basic general plus model does not have that content in the requirements.\n\nApple uses an LTPO display panel in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, as this display technology offers refresh rates that range from 1Hz all the way to 120Hz. The low refresh rate technology is what powers the iPhone 14 Pro's Always-On display. Apple's ProMotion tech, meanwhile, is what allows the iPhone to peak at 120Hz rates for ultra-smooth animations and other benefits.\n\nThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, however, are still expected to add the Dynamic Island design this year instead of the classic notch. The devices will also switch to USB-C for charging and data transfer.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus rumors? Is the addition of the Dynamic Island a big enough change by itself, or should Apple also add ProMotion and Always-On support? Let us know in the comments.",

                    "body": "The new colorway is available for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models, which currently come in midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, and purple. (An actual lavender color -- not the fake \"deep purple\" of the iPhone 14 Pro model.)\n\nThere's not that much different from the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus than the iPhone 14 smartphone lineup that was released last September. It's made with an aluminum body and Ceramic Shield screen for durability and scratch resistance and has the same features and specs, including Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via satellite, and an advanced dual-camera system. The yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus also have the same prices as the rest of the lineup, starting at $799 and $899 respectively.\n\nBut now iPhone users looking to cross to the other side of the color wheel finally have that option. It's like holding sunshine in your hand, and Mashable got to experience its luminosity in person.\n\nHands-on with the yellow iPhone 14 Plus, the shade is bright and creamy. Not so yellow that it's blinding, but just enough pop of color to catch your attention.\n\nLike all iPhone 14 models, the frame is just visible around the edge of the front screen, which creates a distinct yet subtle border that's pleasing to the eye. I just got the device, so I haven't had much time with it yet, but one of my first thoughts is whether fingerprint smudges might be be more noticeable. The glass back makes it easy to buff away any grime, but if you're accident-prone, Apple also released new silicone cases in the same yellow shade along with olive, sky, and iris.\n\nWe haven't seen a lot of yellow from the iPhone maker. Way back in 2013, the lower-end iPhone 5c came in a yellow (along with white, pink, blue, and green). Compared to the cartoony iPhone 5c, this yellow is whimsical yet sophisticated, like doing the Sunday edition of the New York Times crossword puzzle or taking salsa classes.\n\nIf that sounds like you, the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus can be pre-ordered starting March 10 with full availability on March 14.",

                    "body": "Yeah, they were all yellow... Apple rolls out a very eye-catching version of its iPhone 14 standard model, and the Plus version.\n\nApple has released a new bright yellow version of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. Other than the colour change there is no difference to the specifications of either handset, however.\n\nTo recap, both the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature two 12MP rear cameras (wide and ultrawide), backed up by a 12MP TrueDepth selfie cam. In terms of display, the 14 has a 6.1\u2011inch (diagonal) OLED display, offering 2532\u00d71170-pixel resolution at 460 ppi, while opting for the larger Plus gets you a 6.7\u2011inch (diagonal) OLED display, with 2778\u00d71284-pixel resolution at 458 ppi.\n\nAccording to Apple, the rear cameras should perform up to 49% better in low light. This is due to a couple of key upgrades, namely an improved f/1.5 lens aperture, and larger pixels thanks to the aforementioned bigger sensor. The iPhone 14 is also better at taking images of moving subjects than its predecessor.\n\nWhen it comes to video, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus also feature an Action mode, which compensates for shake and motion, along with Cinematic mode, which supports 4K at 30 fps and 4K at 24 fps.\n\nOther salient features include Emergency SOS vis satellite, which will could literally be a life saver if you find yourself in trouble - be it in a sketchy part of a town or city, or if you are out hiking in unforgiving terrain. Crash Detection, designed to be of assistance after a car crash, is also provided. The phone will detect a very serious crunch and call the emergency services.\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available to order from Friday, March 10th, with delivery scheduled for March 14th. iPhone 14 Pro users will have to make do with the existing colour schemes, unfortunately. Not exactly green with envy, but yellow, possibly?\n\niPhone vs Android: Which is better for photography?",

                    "body": "I'm a little disappointed that Apple didn't give a name to the yellow it splashed on its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. It's just yellow, or Yellow iPhone 14. At least the really deep blue got 'Midnight' but Apple clearly had no interest in something like \"Banana Yellow,\" \"Sunflower Yellow,\" or \"Merengue Yellow.\"\n\nLook, it's not just me. After I unboxed the gleaming yellow handset and showed it to coworkers and colleagues, more than one asked about the name. They, too, were sad that Apple didn't go the Samsung route and name it, say, \"Lemon Yellow\" like Samsung's \"Bora Purple,\" which when translated out of Korean means \"Purple Purple.\"\n\nThe new color variant, which takes the total of iPhone 14 color options to six, was unveiled without fanfare on Tuesday (March 7). It brings a glossy yellow back, a burnished yellow tinted metal band, and new pale yellow wallpaper to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. They go on pre-order on March 10, 2023, and ship on March 14.\n\nAside from the cheery new finish, there is nothing different about this iPhone 14 (the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max do not get the new hue). there's the same dual 12MP rear camera system and front-facing, 12MP TrueDepth camera; the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display; and the same last-gen A15 Bionic CPU. It's just as good an iPhone now as it was when I reviewed it in a different color.\n\nWhen I was in kindergarten, the teacher asked us all our favorite color. In a panic, and because I had not once in my five years considered this question, I blurted out \"yellow.\" Before long I had yellow shirts, hats, and a yellow placemat with my name on it. The color has stuck with me for decades. Even now, if you were to ask me my favorite color, I'd say, \" yellow,\" while secretly still having no idea.\n\nNow, as I stare at this lovely and quite cheerful 6.1-inch smartphone, I'm confronted again with the question of color preference. This is a gorgeous smartphone. As always, Apple puts the color under the rear panel glass and basically embeds it in the metal band surrounding the phone. This enhances the premium look and feel. But how do I feel about the color?\n\nUnlike the Purple iPhone 14 or my Space Black iPhone 14 Pro, the yellow iPhone 14 almost shouts, \"look at me!\" There is no way to hide this handset when you take it out of your pocket. And don't think the yellow MagSafe case will save you from looks. It's an even brighter shade of yellow.\n\nAs for the new yellow theme wallpaper, which will launch soon in an iOS update, it's the picture of subtlety. You might not even realize it has a yellow tint.\n\nI took the phone outside and held it in front of a yellow truck, a yellow bus, and a New York City yellow taxi cab. Guess what? None of those things are truly yellow. They're all various shades of orange. The yellow iPhone is true yellow, my friends.\n\nAfter I'd had my fill of the yellow submarine iPhone experience, I started asking for more third-party input.\n\nI just held the yellow iPhone 14 up in front of people and waited for reactions. It never took long. Yellow smacks you in the face. Most people I spoke to seemed pleased, or at least intrigued, by the new DayGlo finish.\n\nOne guy pointed out that yellow is coded \"neither masculine nor feminine,\" which is a pretty astute observation. This is a springtime (if you live in the northern hemisphere) color that could appeal to all. Perhaps Apple is releasing it now and in this color to propel iPhone sales (I have no information that they're slow at all) with a hue that anyone can carry.\n\nNow here's something I hadn't considered: changing tastes. I recently redid my kitchen and instead of muted tones, we went with bold, deep blue cabinets. It's lovely. I don't think we would've considered yellow but then we're probably not that on-trend.\n\nI also think Michelle nailed it on the color: Frozen mango sorbet.\n\nOkay, John's issues seem to go beyond the yellow, but I've heard this sentiment elsewhere. Yellow is not groundbreaking and, as others pointed out, we'd be more excited if Apple paired this announcement with the introduction of yellow AirPods.\n\nInstead, Apple seems to want credit for introducing a yellow iPhone 14 as if it's some kind of innovation. It's not, clearly.\n\nA rather unscientific Twitter poll seemed more in line with John's sentiment, with most people saying they didn't like it very much. On the bright yellow side, more than a third said they love it.\n\nJohn's frustration was an outlier among the insta-reactions I got. Most people seemed either enchanted by the new color or at least willing to admit that it will get noticed.\n\nI wonder who might feel torn between buying the yellow iPhone 14 they want and a high-performance iPhone 14 Pro, which is not available in yellow.\n\nMichelle, though, countered with the notion that \"regular people\" (meaning people who haven't dedicated their lives to geeky pursuits) will probably choose this Yellow iPhone 14 over an iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nMaybe so.\n\nAt the very least, I have to agree with one colleague who told me that when you take it out of your pocket, \"people are gonna go 'wow.'\"",

It reigned as the best-selling handset in China, U.S., U.K., Germany, and France.\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro Max was the second best-selling device. Apple's iPhone 14 Pro Max was third, followed by a break to award the Samsung Galaxy A13 as the fourth best-selling device.\n\n\"The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant,\" the analysis found.\n\n\"Major advancements in the iPhone 14 Pro series, such as dynamic island and faster processor, make it more attractive, as the base model is almost identical to the previous year's model.\"\n\nThe oldest device to make the top 10 was the iPhone 12, with the sixth-highest smartphone sales. The analysis notes price cuts due to new iPhone launches and its 5G capability played a role in its popularity.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A03 also made the list, marking its place as the 10th best-selling smartphone in 2022.",

                    "body": "As has become customary in recent years, March is the month chosen by Apple to present the first new products of the year. Although in this 2023 they surprised us with the launch of the MacBook Pro and Mac mini M2 Pro and Pro Max and the new HomePod, historically this month is usually the common one for the launch of the new iPhone colors and the rest of accessories that go with it. And the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are no exception to the rule.\n\nThe iPhone spring update arrives with an all-new color, a nice selection of cases online with more pastel shades. and new Apple Watch straps, also in spring colors. Generally, the arrival of new colors for the iPhone is accompanied by new features although, being the same terminal, they are usually related to software updates.\n\nWhat is certain is that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. are now available in yellow. In this way, Apple has confirmed a rumor that had begun to circulate in the last hours of yesterday. The new shade is in addition to those already available in the range: midnight, star white, product(RED), blue and purple..\n\nThe iPhone 14, now also available in yellow\n\nWith the new model in yellow, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus give a new option to users who were not attracted by the color options we mentioned previously. It is worth remembering, as we have already said, that the cell phones do not change in any technical section compared to those already on the market.\n\n\ud83d\udc49You might appreciate Apple delays the launch of its mixed reality glasses, but only by a couple of months\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus continue to offer the already familiar features, with their respective 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays. Inside they boast the A15 Bionic chip that we already met in 2021 from the iPhone 13s, and incorporate the crash detection and satellite connection technologies that were announced in September 2022.\n\nThis being the case, it is clear that those who opt for this new color. will do so purely for aesthetic reasonsand not because they are looking for improved functions. The good thing is that they will not have to wait too long to get their hands on this new variant announced by Cupertino.\n\nAvailability and price\n\nBoth the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in yellow. will be available for pre-order in Spain from Friday, March 10 at 14:00.. Deliveries will start next Tuesday, March 14. Apple assures that this new version will reach more than 60 countries.\n\nOn pricing, no change.

While as for the iPhone 14 Plus, the base model starts at \u20ac1,159 and goes up to \u20ac1,549 for the variant with more storage.\n\nAs for the silicone cases with MagSafe that have also been presented today, there are four models. They are: canary yellow, olive green, sky blue and iris.. It is worth mentioning that, in addition to being compatible with the standard iPhone 14 and the Plus model, they are also available for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. In all cases, they are available at the official Apple store for 59 euros.\n\n\ud83d\udc49You might appreciate All about the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, the new beasts from Apple",

                    "body": "Apple has this feeling that is indeed so appealing, and that feeling is that they need to add \"yellow\" to its slate of iPhone case colours. Alright, sing it with me, kids: \"ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.\"\n\nApple announced its new yellow-tinted phones early Wednesday. It's thankfully not a full-vibrant mustard colour, but a subdued, soothing pastel tone. Everything else about the already solid iPhone 14 and 14 Plus remains the same, of course. The new colour option should be available \"this Autumn,\" according to the company's announcement.\n\nThe specs remain unchanged.\n\nApple tends to keep certain colours specific to certain phone iterations. Remember when rose gold was the big thing? Last March, Apple put out an \"alpine green\" iPhone 13 and 13 Pro, a dark green colour that seemed geared more toward folks who wear forest military camouflage patterns when walking around cities without any trees in sight. Compared to that, the yellow iPhone 14 fits more in line with the classic, subdued Apple look.\n\nYellow joins the current slate of other colours, including \"midnight\" (dark grey), \"starlight\" (white), red, blue (really a grayish-blue), and (really light) purple. It will be interesting to see what kinds of colour palettes Apple will release with its upcoming iPhone 15.\n\nIt's interesting Apple didn't add the colourway to its 14 Pro and Pro Max phones. When reviewing both the 14 and 14 Pro Max last year, we declared the iPhone 14 was a device in search of a reason to exist. The iPhone 14 failed to wow us like the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max did. We said there was just not enough new to convince us it wasn't worth spending a little more for the Pro or Pro Max. Regardless, Apple make brilliant phones.",

The new yellow has a soft, pastel tone to it.\n\nThe new yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be available to preorder Friday. Most people are likely to put a case on their iPhone 14 no matter which color the phone is. If that's you, Apple also launched a new yellow silicone case, too.",

Apple Apple announced a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The new color can help Apple juice sales midway through a release cycle ahead of the iPhone 15. Aside from the color, the new phone is the same as the previously released iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nIf you're in the market for a new iPhone, there's a new spring-time hue available.\n\nApple announced a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus on Tuesday.\n\nThe move to debut a new model color, which was rumored earlier this week, follows Apple's past sales strategy, as Bloomberg points out. Apple has been known to introduce new colors to its product lines several months after an initial launch to reignite consumer interest and juice sales in the period between new flagship offerings.\n\nIn 2022, for example, Apple released green additions of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Plus midway through the first year the iPhone 13 lineup went on sale. The year before, Apple added a purple shade to the iPhone 12 range midway through the product cycle.\n\n\u00a9 Apple Apple's new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 plus in a yellow shade launches on Tuesday, March 14. Apple Aside from the cosmetic color change, nothing about this model of the iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus has changed from the iPhone 14 lineup announced last September. The new shade is the sixth to be added to the iPhone 14 range, alongside previous colors including midnight, red, starlight, blue, and lavender.\n\nThis announcement falls around six months before the next iPhone, presumably called the iPhone 15, is expected to launch in September.\n\nThe yellow iPhones will be available to pre-order starting at $799 on March 10, and will launch online and in stores on March 14.\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

Tipster yeux1122 took to Naver to shine some light on the production schedules for the upcoming crop of iPhones claiming Apple is preparing to enter mass production for the iPhone 15 series.\n\nThe leakster also claims that the LTPO 120Hz refresh screens will be limited to the two Pro models i.e. the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The move is not surprising as Apple used the same approach on last year's iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max as well as their predecessors in the iPhone 13 Pro generation back in 2021.",

Credentials Named a Tech Media Trailblazer by the Consumer Technology Association in 2019, a winner of SPJ NorCal's Excellence in Journalism Awards in 2022 and has twice been a finalist in the LA Press Club's National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Awards.\n\nIt may sound like I'm being overly dramatic, but that trip to the Verizon store signaled a big shift for me. I've always prided myself on not buying into the Apple hype. Despite years of pestering from friends to switch to an iPhone, I pushed back, maintaining that I liked being different from the masses. Everyone around me has an iPhone. It felt good to defy the norm. And so for years, I stuck with my Samsung Galaxy devices, which I still believe are incredible phones.\n\nBut after conversations with friends and family about what I could get from the iPhone that I could never get with my Android, I started to reconsider my stance. Yes, I loved my Galaxy S10 Plus and everything it offered: a top-notch camera, a customizable interface and Object Eraser, which removes any unwanted people or objects from your pictures (Pixel phones have a similar feature). But at the end of the day, there was one big thing my Android could never offer: a seamless way to communicate with all my friends on the iPhone.\n\nRead more: Android vs. iPhone: 7 Things Apple Phone Owners Wish They Could Do\n\nI've been told countless times that I ruin group chats by turning all the texts \"green.\" This is because Apple refuses to make iMessage compatible with Android phones, so when you message someone who isn't on iOS, you'll see green text bubbles instead of the standard blue ones. Because this felt like a superficial complaint -- and is 100% Apple's fault -- I brushed it aside.\n\nUntil I realized I was missing out on other, more significant benefits of owning an iPhone.\n\nUnless you use a third-party app like WhatsApp, there's no easy way to send high-resolution photos and videos directly between an Android phone and an iPhone. I was OK with just using WhatsApp... until I began to envy my friends who were instantaneously AirDropping pictures and videos after our hangouts. WhatsApp also diminishes the quality of videos, and Google Drive takes a lot longer to upload videos to.\n\nIt also was frustrating that apps like TikTok diminished my camera quality on Android. Comparing TikTok videos taken on an iPhone -- even an older version like the iPhone X -- with those taken on my Galaxy S10 Plus is like night and day. On my Galaxy, TikTok distorted the colors and blurred everything in the most unflattering and unrealistic way. On the iPhone, videos are crisp and clear and appear just as they should. For someone who uses TikTok as much as I do, this was important.\n\nThese reasons, along with the fact that I already use a MacBook and would therefore benefit from the Apple ecosystem, led me to start changing my mind about owning an iPhone. Throw in features like the new always-on display on the iPhone 14 Pro models -- something I absolutely loved on my Galaxy devices -- and fun new elements like Dynamic Island, and suddenly I was sold on the idea of switching over.\n\nRead more: iPhone or Android? Your Phone Choice Could Be Hampering Your Love Life\n\nYes, I had to fight off feelings of being a sellout. But I realized that ultimately, it's just a phone. And no matter what you do, people will have unsolicited opinions about what device you're using. My Galaxy worked well for me for many years. Now I was ready for something new. And so far, I have no regrets.\n\nCheck out the video above for more of my thoughts on switching from an Android phone to an iPhone. Also, here's my comparison of the iPhone 14 Pro versus the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.",

                    "body": "The upcoming iPhone 15 base model might not have the advanced always-on display and ProMotion features of Apple.\n\nIf this really happens, then it would have the same scenario that its predecessor experienced.\n\nIn 2022, the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were the only models that support the ProMotion and always-on display features.\n\nNow, based on the latest rumors, it seems like Apple fans who will purchase the iPhone 15 models would experience dejavu.\n\nAccording to MacRumors' latest report, the Korean Naver news aggregator account yeux1122 claimed that the always-on display and ProMotion will also be exclusive to iPhone 15 Pro models.\n\nAlso Read: New Apple In-House 5G Modem to Replace Qualcomm's Modems; Here's When Integration Could Start\n\nThis means that the standard iPhone 15 will not have these advanced features.\n\n\"Only the Pro Series supports the LTPO 120 refresh rate, and the basic regular Plus model does not have that in the requirements,\" said the tech blogger via his official post.\n\nAlthough this is the case, many tech enthusiasts believe that the non-Pro iPhone 15 models will still be integrated with a more power-efficient OLED display.\n\nThis screen is expected to have a driver chip manufactured based on a 28nm process, allowing the display to have reduced power consumption.\n\nThe new iPhone 15 lineup is expected to be launched by Apple around September.\n\nThis estimated release date is based on the tech manufacturer's recent launch timeline.\n\nOf course, this can still change depending on the final decision of the iPhone maker.\n\nAlthough it's still months before the new iPhone 15's arrival, many tech enthusiasts and critics already shared possible features the new models could have.\n\nThese include a 5G model chipset from Qualcomm, WiFi 6E connectivity, and many more.\n\nMeanwhile, leaked iPhone 15 renders revealed that the next-gen iOS smartphone could have a Dynamic Island feature for its non-Pro models.\n\nFor more news updates about the iPhone 15 and other new Apple gadgets, always keep your tabs open here at TechTimes.",

                    "title": "iPhone 14 Pro vs. Galaxy S23 Ultra: My Thoughts After Ditching Android",
                    "body": "But I still have a soft spot for Galaxy phones, and when Samsung unveiled the S23 lineup in February, I was eager to see how the top-of-the-line S23 Ultra would compare to my iPhone 14 Pro. So I got my hands on one and began using the phones side by side to compare everything from the cameras to battery life to overall design -- and to see whether I'd have any regrets about switching to the \"dark side.\" Here's what I found.\n\nFirst things first: I have an iPhone 14 Pro, and not a Pro Max, so the Ultra's massive screen definitely stands out in comparison. I never feel like I need a bigger screen than what I get on my 14 Pro, but it definitely doesn't hurt to have that larger display when I'm watching a YouTube video or streaming a show -- or spending too much time on TikTok.\n\nThe trade-off to having that larger screen is trying to fit it in my pocket and having to carry something a bit bulkier. Still, it's a pretty sleek phone for all that real estate.\n\nThe display quality on both phones is stellar, and I don't see much of a quality difference between the two. Right out of the box, the S23 Ultra has a nice bright display, which you can achieve on the iPhone by turning off True Tone (a feature that adjusts the color and intensity of your display depending on your environment). If the brightness on the Ultra is too much, you can inversely mimic the effects of True Tone by going into Display settings and either toggling on Eye comfort shield or going to Screen mode and selecting Natural. You can also play with the White balance scale. Images on the iPhone look slightly sharper, but colors pop a bit more on the S23 Ultra. Overall, though, there's really not much of a difference between the phones.\n\nThere's one aspect to having an iPhone that I haven't quite made peace with yet, and it's the keyboard. I'm glad Apple added Slide to Type with iOS 13 a few years ago, followed by haptic feedback on the keyboard with iOS 16 (finally), because those are features I loved on Android. But I still get frustrated that I have to switch between numbers and letters when I'm typing on the iPhone. Meanwhile, on the Galaxy, the numbers sit just above the letters, so you can select them more quickly, the way you would on a laptop keyboard. You can download different keyboards on the iPhone like Gboard, but it's not the same. I'll admit that's a minor complaint, but I do think the user experience would benefit from Apple taking a page from Android's book -- you know, like they've done many times before. Moving on....\n\nI've had my iPhone for a few months now and thankfully haven't seen any noticeable drops in battery life yet. My phone still lasts a full day of heavy use, but I always need to charge at the end of the day.\n\nThe Ultra's battery is next level. I can go a full day of use and still have some juice left over. That's not surprising, given the S23 Ultra has a 5,000-mAh battery. Apple doesn't share battery capacity for its phones, but says the 14 Pro has up to 23 hours of video playback. An iFixit teardown found the iPhone 14 Pro has a 3,200-mAh battery.\n\nEven though the Ultra has a bigger battery, Apple is actually able to crank out more efficiency from its batteries thanks to iOS and its own A-series chips. Meanwhile, Android has to work with a variety of devices running different processors, so it becomes more important to have that bigger battery.\n\nSpecs and logistics aside, I'm amazed by the Ultra's battery life, as was CNET's mobile reporter Lisa Eadicicco when she reviewed the Ultra.\n\nCamera quality is the most important aspect of any phone for me. I take a lot of pictures and videos for work and social media, including for my very niche tea account on Instagram. The camera on the Galaxy phones kept me in the Samsung family for a decade, so I was eager to compare the S23 Ultra's cameras to the iPhone 14 Pro's.\n\nWhat I noticed right away is how much more saturated photos on the Ultra are. In most cases, that saturation adds a nice color boost to images and makes them stand out more. Pictures of my colorful teacups look even more vibrant on the Ultra. Sometimes, that saturation can be a bit overwhelming and makes photos look unnatural, as if there's a filter on them. But other times, it makes colors and subjects stand out, in a good way.\n\nThe 200-megapixel sensor on the Ultra punches up color and detail even more. A picture I took of a decorative teacup emphasizes the intricate floral design and gold trim and another image of a Klay Thompson mural shows vivid blues and yellows.\n\nNot all moments are made for a 200-megapixel sensor, though. In another image taken outdoors, the sensor removed a few too many highlights, so it was harder to see detail and make sense of what's going on.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the softness and brightness of photos on the Ultra. Shadows on the iPhone are often a bit too harsh and give some images a darker overtone. An image of the sky on the Ultra will look nice and bright, while on the iPhone, there might be distracting shadows under clouds. The Ultra's softness and brightness also make for more flattering selfies. You can adjust the iPhone's camera settings and play around with things like contrast, tone and color temperature, and even mimic photography styles on the Galaxy (and vice versa), but I do wish the iPhone just automatically adjusted for things like shadows a little better.\n\nThe camera feature that surprised me most was Portrait mode. I think of Portrait mode on the iPhone as the gold standard. The subject is usually in perfect focus, the background is smoothly blurred and the colors are more natural looking. But I noticed there's something the Ultra did better than my iPhone. I took a picture of my friend while she had sunglasses on top of her head, and the iPhone struggled to keep the bridge and sides of the glasses in focus, while the Ultra didn't. It's that small detail that shows how far Portrait mode has come on Galaxy phones. I still prefer the look of iPhone portraits because of the lower saturation, and you can catch a bit more detail in the background, which is nice.\n\nGiven the popularity of TikTok and Instagram Reels right now, video is a huge focus for both Apple and Samsung -- and also important for folks like me who take a lot of videos. Since switching to the iPhone, I've seen an uptick in the quality of my videos. The colors are more natural and the images sharper. Cinematic mode makes subjects pop and lends a more professional look to my content. Samsung has its own Cinematic mode equivalent, called Portrait video. It also does a great job of blurring the background, but objects and people look a little less defined than they do on iPhone.\n\nOne area where the Ultra is a clear winner is with video stabilization. Even walking down the stairs, the footage is incredibly smooth, as if you're using a gimbal. With the iPhone, you can still sense each step being taken, and there's a lot more movement.\n\nLet's be honest: the iPhone's camera bumps are ridiculous. The Ultra is a breath of fresh air because the cameras don't stick out as much, so it wobbles less when you set it down.\n\nThe S Pen on the Ultra is a fun extra, though I never found myself reaching for it. There's not much I want to write by hand, and I can just tap the screen for pretty much all functions. Still, I'm glad the legacy of the retired Galaxy Note series lives on.\n\nThe in-screen fingerprint reader was a favorite feature of mine on my Galaxy phones, and it's nice to have that option again while using the Ultra. I missed it when I first switched to the iPhone, but Face ID is solid enough that I quickly got over it. Unlocking both phones has been seamless.\n\nThe S23 Ultra is $1,200 for 256 GB of storage and is priced similarly to the iPhone 14 Pro Max with the same amount of storage. The smaller iPhone 14 Pro is $1,100 for 256GB. Whether you're a Galaxy fan or an iPhone lover, $1,200 is a lot. But in this case, you get what you pay for.\n\nIt's been fun to revisit a world I've abandoned and compare the iPhone I have now to the one I could've had if I'd stayed in the Galaxy family. While there are aspects to the S23 Ultra that I appreciate, like brighter and more colorful images, better video stabilization and incredible battery life, there are advantages to having an iPhone that go beyond specs that'll likely keep me in the Apple ecosystem for a while. Features like Airdrop and iMessage have made the user experience more seamless. And I don't know if I could give up the iPhone's video quality for anything else.\n\nStill, I know that if I want to take a picture that makes people's jaws drop, I'll likely reach for the S23 Ultra. Then I'll wait for the look of shock when I tell them it wasn't taken with an iPhone.\n\nCheck out the video above to see more of my experience trying out these two phones, along with some side-by-side examples of photos and videos taken on each.",

                    "body": "Folks, pay no attention to the beautiful, bright yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. They're a distraction -- bad deals covered in fun colors. And Apple knows it.\n\nI was the proud owner of a yellow iPhone XR for four years, and I loved that darn device. I'm obsessed with color -- it affects my mood and it's a key part of my personal expression -- so a yellow iPhone added a lot to my life. It made me happy to look at every day, elevated my style, and was easy to find in even the messiest gym bag.\n\nI was really bummed when I needed to replace that phone earlier this year. No yellow option was available for the iPhone 14 line, though I was tempted by the soft blue and light lavender of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. The iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Max were limited to silver, gold, deep purple, and space black -- snore! -- and were more expensive.\n\nGiven that I've asked Apple for a hot pink iPhone, it may surprise you that I resisted the temptation for a bright color and bought an iPhone 14 Pro in plain old gold. When Apple announced its new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus(Opens in a new tab) this morning, I wondered if I had made a mistake.\n\nBut I know the Pro was the right decision for my wallet, and that it might be right for yours, too.\n\nCompare, for example, the 128 GB iPhone 14 and 128 GB iPhone 14 Pro. The main differences between the two phones are their color options, an extra camera lens, and about $200: the $799 iPhone 14 offers two lenses, while the $999 iPhone 14 Pro offers three.\n\nYears ago, each new iPhone release came with camera technology leaps and bounds above the previous iteration. But progress has slowed down since then, and the camera tech improvement in new iPhones is incremental. So when one device has two lenses and another offers three, that's a huge difference in value.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and Max may be more expensive in the short run, but they'll be cheaper in the long run. By buying an iPhone with three lenses, you'll keep your device from becoming obsolete more quickly.\n\nBut Apple knows that sometimes, a color calls to you. That's why they make their cheaper offerings bright, bold, and, for someone like me, almost irresistible. Unless that phone is hot pink...then, Apple, you might get me to fall for it.",

                    "body": "Apple sold the best-selling phone of 2022, the iPhone 13. Apple also sold the second-best selling phone of 2022, the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Apple also sold the third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth best-selling phones of the year, according to new data from research firm Counterpoint. That's despite three of those phones only being available for four months of the year.\n\nIt's the first time a single brand has ever captured eight of the top 10 spots in the best-selling smartphone list, Counterpoint says.\n\nThe only other company to crack the top-10 list was Samsung. Samsung's Galaxy A13 ranked fourth, while its Galaxy Ao3 ranked 10th.\n\nCounterpoint says marketshare will increase for these phones in 2023 as Apple, Samsung, and other smartphone brands focus on clearing out inventory and optimizing product launches.\n\n\"For the first time, a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models,\" Counterpoint says.\n\n\"The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant. Major advancements in the iPhone 14 Pro series, such as dynamic island and faster processor, make it more attractive, as the base model is almost identical to the previous year's model.\"\n\nIt's important to note that it's only possible for Apple to capture so many places on the top 10 best-selling phones list because it is the only manufacturer of iPhones, which approach 50% market share with Android-based based in some wealthy nations, while taking just over a quarter of global market share: 27.6% according to Statista. In addition, many Android phone manufacturers such as Samsung spread their market share over significantly more models, meaning Apple's overall market share is more concentrated for each model of iPhone it sells.\n\nStill, it's a significant accomplishment.\n\nThese 10 top phones account for 19% of global sales volume, according to Counterpoint. There were around 3,600 distinct models of smartphones available for sale globally in 2022, the company says, down from the 4,200 available in 2021. Very likely, that trend will continue as the smartphone industry continues to mature and consolidate.",

                    "body": "It was simply a matter of time before the iPhone 14 received a color refresh. Just in time for spring, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are now available in an infectiously peppy yellow.\n\nCompared to previous years, the iPhone 14 color selection, IMHO, lacked that little bit of charisma. As an unwavering proponent of colorful tech, I wasn't impressed by my options when I went to upgrade my own handset. I opted for the white iPhone 14 Pro Max, deviating from my routine of ordering the signature color of the lineup. At least I could give it some personality with a bright-hued iPhone 14 Pro Max case.\n\nWhile there's a reason the iPhone 14 lineup dominates our list of the best phones, I wouldn't chalk it up to style. But with the new yellow option, which I've currently got in hand, there's a color option that might make you feel something -- something good.\n\nIf I had to describe the color, I'd say it falls somewhere between a just-ripe banana and a cartoon smiley face. It's not far off from the Minion's signature yellow either. It's not quite as neon as a lemon, but it's more saturated than a piece of pineapple. (I'd apologize for all the fruit comparisons, but it's absolutely appropriate in this case.)\n\nUnlike the iPhone 13 Pro in green, the iPhone 14 in yellow isn't subtle. I took it outside to see if it catches the natural light differently, but the color looked consistent. It looked especially nice next to some early-blooming daffodils, though.\n\nThis isn't the first yellow iPhone. The iPhone 11 came in a similar yellow, among other pastel takes on purple and green. Without seeing the iPhone 11, I can't say for sure how similar (or not) the shade is compared to the iPhone 14. But with the flat-edged design compared to the phased-out curved casing, the color certainly looks sleeker on Apple's latest flagship.\n\nWhat's more, the aluminum edges are color-matched to the yellow back. The metallic finish does skew a bit gold, but since the iPhone 14 Pro color of gold is rather muted, the iPhone 14 in yellow remains distinct.\n\nApple elevated the functional design of the iPhone 14 to make it easier to repair. An internal upgrade allows the back glass to be removed from the logic board and therefore simpler to replace as a single part if it shatters. So if you were to crack the glass of your yellow iPhone 14, you'd pay less for a replacement compared to the same damage on the iPhone 13.\n\nPre-orders for the yellow iPhone 14 and yellow iPhone 14 Plus begin Friday, March 10, with availability on Tuesday, March 14. There's no change in price -- the phones start at $799 and $899 respectively. Still, be sure to check out the best iPhone deals right now.",

                    "body": "Now getting the work week going today for Tuesday, Amazon is now discounting an assortment of official Apple MagSafe Leather cases for the latest iPhone 14 series handsets. All shipping for free, pricing starts at $37.49 across the collection of all four Apple handsets. All down from the usual $59 going rates, these cases either mark some of the best prices yet, or are delivering new all-time lows in their own right. There's as much as 34% in savings, too, with today's discounts also undercutting previous mentions by $4.\n\nApple's official MagSafe cases cover your iPhone 14 series device in a specially tanned and finished leather that's complemented by machined buttons to round out the premium stylings. Alongside magnets that allow it to snap right onto the back of your device, there's also support for Apple's MagSafe charging features, allowing you to outfit your handset with a high-end yet feature-packed piece of protection. So whether you just picked up an iPhone 14 or you're finally ready to swap out that more affordable case you bought at launch with some genuine leather, today's discounts are worth a look. Head below for a full break down of the price cuts.\n\nNow both halfway through the week and starting off a new month, all of the other best discounts right now are up for grabs in our Apple guide. From the latest flagship macOS devices seeing some of the first notable discounts like the 14-inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro at $200 off to the latest from other corners of our favorite Cupertino company, there are plenty of other all-time lows on tap today.\n\nDesigned by Apple to complement iPhone 14 Pro, the Leather Case with MagSafe is a delightful way to give your iPhone extra protection while adding style. Made from specially tanned and finished leather, the outside feels soft to the touch and develops a natural patina over time. The case quickly snaps into place and fits snugly over your iPhone without adding bulk. With built-in magnets that align perfectly with iPhone 14 Pro, the case offers a magical attach and detach experience, every time.",

                    "body": "Apple today announced a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, adding even more color choices to the lineup this spring.... The new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available to pre-order this Friday, March 10, with availability starting Tuesday, March 14.\n\nThe new yellow is pretty, as are some of the other colors. It remains a little off-putting that Apple doesn't make the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in vibrant colors -- Pro apparently means \"boring.\" But it's all moot without a clear case that lets the iPhone color shine through -- I had to take my iPhone 14 Pro out of its Smartish Wallet Slayer Vol. 1 case to remind myself what color it is (a sort of purplish-gray).\n\nFor those who want to see their iPhone and carry a couple of cards, I just stumbled upon a clear iPhone case that includes an integrated card slot, something that hadn't previously turned up in my wallet case research (see \"Three Wallet Cases: Bellroy, Encased, and Smartish,\" 26 September 2022).",

                    "body": "The rumored iPhone SE 4 is set to sport the first OLED display in Apple's budget iPhone lineup, but it's one that iPhone users will already know well.\n\nLeaker Ming-Chi Kuo claimed last week that, despite rumors of its cancellation not only is Apple working on an iPhone SE 4 but also revealed that it will be based on the iPhone 14 and now according to Korean publication The Elec, more details have emerged.\n\nThey claim that the iPhone SE 4 will feature a 6.1-inch OLED display from Chinese firm BOE using components leftover from its production of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 displays. Samsung and LG usually take a significant role in the development of Apple's displays but considering the demand for the iPhone 14 series and the upcoming iPhone 15 series, they have enough on their plates.\n\nHere's the money quote from The Elec (translated):\n\n\"According to the industry on the 3rd, BOE is expected to supply 6.1-inch organic light emitting diode (OLED) for the low-end iPhone SE4, which is expected to be released next year. The iPhone SE series has so far only been released as a liquid crystal display (LCD) model, but next year's model is likely to be applied with OLED.\"\n\nWith its foundations using familiar components, BOE will reportedly be trusted to take sole responsibility for the iPhone SE 4 display.\n\nAs good a value as the iPhone SE 2022 has been, it's looking super dated next to the best cheap phones like the Google Pixel 6a. So a new model is definitely needed from Apple.\n\nObviously, the move from LCD to OLED is significant, as you'll get richer colors, truer blacks and wider viewing angles. Those on a budget, or who just want one of the best small phones, will also appreciate moving away from the iPhone SE 2022's Touch ID button and chunky bezels.\n\nOther iPhone SE 4 upgrades should include a proper night mode for the camera and a more powerful Bionic chip. Overall, the iPhone SE 4 could be a pocket-sized wonder, but it reportedly won't be released until 2024. So for 2023 all eyes will be on the new iPhone 15 series.",

                    "body": "Apple has revealed that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will indeed get a new color for spring, and that's yellow.\n\nThe new color for the iPhone 14 (Image Credit: Apple)\n\nAs Apple puts it, these smartphones will be available to buy in a \"beautiful yellow color\" as the rumor mill had already insisted last week.\n\nWhile we did know that yellow was inbound as the new paint job, we didn't know exactly what shade of yellow Apple would grace us with.\n\nAnd judging from the considerably fruit-themed reaction on Twitter, that yellow is either 'banana yellow' or perhaps lemon. (The latter isn't a comparison Apple will be particularly fond of, doubtless - the firm doesn't want to be accused of selling anyone a lemon, ahem).\n\nHowever, some folks would have preferred a deeper yellow, perhaps with more orange (mango), or more to the point, a bit more gold about it.\n\nThen again, there are others who are fine with the lighter, brighter yellow Apple has gone with. Doubtless the exact color was a decision made over the course of probably hundreds of meetings where fine nuances of shade and consumer appeal were thrashed out to within an inch of their very existence.\n\nFallen in love with the new yellow and want to buy an iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus in that color? Well, these fresh options for the range are up for pre-order on March 10th, in just a few days, with the handsets available next week on March 14th.\n\nApple last used yellow on an iPhone 11, and the exact color that furnished those models was similar to what we see today - except the new take is a bit lighter and fresher. Lemony fresh, perhaps.\n\nIn total, the iPhone 14 now comes in six colors: midnight, starlight, red, blue, purple, and the new yellow.",

Apple has been known to introduce new colors to its product lines several months after an initial launch to reignite consumer interest and juice sales in the period between new flagship offerings.\n\nIn 2022, for example, Apple released green additions of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Plus midway through the first year the iPhone 13 lineup went on sale. The year before, Apple added a purple shade to the iPhone 12 range midway through the product cycle.\n\nAside from the cosmetic color change, nothing about this model of the iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus has changed from the iPhone 14 lineup announced last September. The new shade is the sixth to be added to the iPhone 14 range, alongside previous color including midnight, red, starlight, blue, and lavender.\n\nThis announcement falls around six months before the next iPhone, presumably called the iPhone 15, is expected to launch in September.\n\nThe yellow iPhones will be available to pre-order starting at $799 on March 10, and will launch online and in stores on March 14.",

                    "body": "Apple iPhone prices tend to be very stable, with rare discounts throughout the year. Hence, it is especially important to keep an eye on carrier discounts. You end up paying for the phone over two or three years, but usually get a hefty discount over buying them unlocked.\n\nIn this article, you will find all offerings from carriers and major retailers in a simple price comparison, so that you can choose the one that is most convenient for you. We will keep this page updated with the most recent iPhone models available in the US.\n\nBefore we dive into the different carriers, there are a few things you will need to keep in mind. I strongly recommend you get your calculator out to figure out the exact cost you will have to pay with your own individual plan. It is well known that a carrier deal may look great with the device, but the plans themselves may be overpriced.\n\nIn case you are looking to get the best price for your older iPhone model, trading it in might not be the best solution. So it is a good idea to try your luck outside of the Apple and carrier ecosystem and this is how you can resell your iPhone for the best possible price.\n\nLastly, because nobody wants to buy a phone with the color they dislike the most, I advise you to take a look at the options that are available on each page. One carrier may have the (Product) color available in the 256 GB version but another may not. So if you do not find the color or capacity that you want I would recommend you to check other carriers too, or perhaps an unlocked version.\n\nThe best deals for the flagship iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max can be found when pairing the purchase with a phone contract. You can get up to $1000 off the device's price when signing up for an unlimited plan.\n\nThe 2023 vanilla iPhones are not far behind when it comes to discounts. If you are lucky, you can even grab a phone for free when signing up with an unlimited phone plan.\n\nFor the 2021 iPhones, the requirements to get a free phone are considerably lower, with some carriers asking only for customers to sign up for a contract plan, usually an unlimited one.\n\nDeals for the iPhone 12 are usually not as attractive, especially since carriers usually offer better discounts on the pricier (and more modern) iPhone 13. Still, you can usually get a free iPhone 12 when signing up for a phone contract:\n\nThe \"junior iPhone\" is a good, albeit old-fashioned, way of getting into the Apple ecosystem. The cheapest iPhone can also be found for free when signing a phone contract, with additional deals when trading your old phone in.",

                    "body": "You might have the impression that the tech world in general is at a bit of a standstill. Companies push new products every year, but tout iterative features rather than revolutionary changes. Today, for example, Apple is pushing a brand-new iPhone, just six months after releasing the latest suite of devices. The thing is, it isn't just similar to last year's iPhone: It's exactly the same. Oh, but it's now yellow. I guess that's new.\n\nYes, the \"new\" iPhone is just a yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. That's it. That's the \"new.\" No camera upgrade, no speed boost, no brighter display. You now have the option to buy an iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus that looks a little like your favorite electric Pok\u00e9mon, in case you weren't sold on the five colors the 14 and 14 Plus launched with -- Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED.\n\nOtherwise, it's the same iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. The devices sport 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch OLED displays, respectively, and carry over the A15 Bionic chip from the iPhone 13 line. You get the dual-camera system (wide and ultra-wide), with the \"Photonic Engine\" for capturing better mid- to low-light images. They also sport Apple's Action mode (for capturing fast-moving subjects with increased stabilization) and Cinematic mode (for shooting film-like video with a shallow depth of field).\n\nYou'll also find Emergency SOS via Satellite, which lets you reach out for help in areas without cell service, and Crash Detection, which can automatically dial emergency services when the iPhone thinks you've been in an accident (although it might also call the cops on your for skiing).\n\nApple has a history of issuing color refreshes midway through iPhone cycles. Back in 2021, for example, the company released a purple iPhone 12 and 12 mini \"just in time for spring.\" The aim seems to be to juice flagging support for a device halfway through its product cycle.\n\nWhen the iPhone 14 initially dropped, I didn't think it was the best deal on the market, and I still think you'd be better served by picking up last year's iPhone 13 at a discount, or the iPhone 14 Pro if you can afford the extra $200. Of course, the 14 Pro doesn't come in yellow. If you want your iPhone to look like Pikachu, the new 14 is your only option (next to, you know, a yellow case).",

                    "title": "The Yellow iPhone 14 Has Arrived",
                    "body": "Once again, Apple is offering up a mid-cycle colour refresh for the iPhone, with the arrival of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in a new \"beautiful yellow.\"\n\nPlausible rumours of the new colour began circulating late last week. Considering that Apple has been adding a splash of colour to its entry-level iPhones for the past two years, it was a pretty safe bet that we'd be seeing something new appear this month; the reports just gave us some more insight into exactly what colour to expect.\n\nThe timing aligns almost perfectly with last year's unveiling of the iPhone 13 in green, which came during a more significant event on Tuesday, March 8, where Apple also unveiled the Mac Studio and third-generation iPhone SE.\n\nDespite reports that Apple has a few other surprises in the pipeline, the pushing out of the yellow iPhone 14 by press release suggests that Apple doesn't have any major product events planned in the next few weeks. Of course, that doesn't preclude the company from holding an event sometime in April, which could see the debut of a new 15-inch MacBook Air, but there's no point in waiting until next month to get the new iPhone 14 colour onto the market.\n\nAlthough Apple didn't release the purple iPhone 12 until April, the iPhone 12 lineup already had a later initial release than usual due to complications resulting from the global health pandemic. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro arrived in October, while the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max didn't land until November. This put the purple iPhone 12 on the market six months after the other colours were released.\n\nWhat's more noteworthy about this year's new colour is that Apple hasn't done anything new with its iPhone 14 Pro models. Last year, Alpine Green was added to the iPhone 13 Pro alongside the green iPhone 13, marking the first and only mid-cycle colour release for Apple's higher-end flagship model.\n\nHowever, the original iPhone 13 Pro was unique among Pro models in that its special colour was a lighter Sienna Blue, a stark contrast to the Midnight Green, Pacific Blue, and Deep Purple colours that have adorned other iPhone Pro models. Alpine Green arguably brought the iPhone 13 Pro back into the same class of colours.\n\nWhile announcing the new colour, Apple took the opportunity to sing the praises of its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models, but don't let that fool you into thinking anything more than the colour has changed.\n\nFor example, when Apple says the iPhone 14 has \"an updated internal design\" and better battery life, it's not referring to the yellow iPhone 14 -- it's merely repeating the same things it said about the iPhone 14 back in September.\n\nThat's not a bad thing, of course. The iPhone 14 is still the same great phone it was six months ago, and if you've been waiting to pull the trigger on upgrading and the new yellow appeals to you, it's not a bad time to jump in. Just keep in mind that there's almost certainly an iPhone 15 coming in about six months. While that won't likely get any massive upgrades -- Apple usually reserves those for its Pro models -- it's almost certainly going to get a faster chip, and most rumours point to the notch being retired in favour of the Dynamic Island introduced on the iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nStill, if a vibrant yellow is the iPhone you've been looking for, you can pre-order the new colour starting this Friday, March 10, at 8 a.m. ET. They'll be available in stores on March 14. Apple is also releasing new silicone case colours that include a complementary canary yellow.",

                    "body": "Apple shows off a yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus, and we take in all its sun-like radiance.\n\nApple is shining a bright new cheery color on the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus: Yellow. The fresh colorway doesn't add to the iPhone 14's core features -- which still include powerful cameras, Emergency SOS via satellite, and Crash Detection -- but it does perhaps make it slightly harder to pick the right color for you.\n\nApple showed us both the yellow iPhone 14 and yellow iPhone 14 Plus devices in person. The rear glass features a vibrant shade of yellow, with a slightly duller, almost mustard-like yellow tint to the aluminum frame. It's a purer yellow than the iPhone XR from a few years ago, which featured more of an orange tint. If yellow is not your favorite color, this yellow iPhone isn't going to change your mind, but yellow fans will likely be attracted to the new, sunshiney shade.\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 features the same 6.1-inch display as before, while the 14 Plus has the same 6.7-inch screen, both of which earned excellent ratings. The screens have the same Super Retina XDR tech that supports 1,200 nits of brightness (peak outdoor), meaning they are more than vibrant enough to match the bright new yellow hue.\n\nStorage options are unchanged. The 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB models are available in the new color, starting at $799 for the iPhone 14 and $899 for the iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nApple carried over the powerful A15 Bionic chip with its 5-core GPU, so you can still bank on the fantastic performance we observed in our iPhone 14 review.\n\nBefore the launch of the yellow model, Apple offered the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus in Blue, Purple, Midnight (black), Starlight (white), and (Product) Red. Adding yellow brings the total options to six, which is enough to offer variety without making the decision too difficult.\n\nApple will begin accepting preorders for the yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus on Friday, March 10, at 5 a.m. PST, with general availability to follow on March 14.\n\nApple is also expanding the color selection for its Silicone Case with MagSafe to accompany the launch of the yellow phone. For all iPhone 14 models (including the Pro and Pro Max), Apple is adding Canary Yellow, Iris, Olive, and Sky protective cases to its offerings. That brings the total number of colors for the Silicone Case with MagSafe to 12.\n\nApple Watch lovers aren't left out of the loop, either, as the company revealed several new Apple Watch bands, including a Herm\u00e8s Saphir Casaque Single Tour band for $319. The Solo Loop band received four new colors -- Canary Yellow, Olive, Purple Fog, and Sprout Green. The Sport Band now comes in Bright Orange, Olive, and Sky colors. Finally, Apple debuted Bright Orange, Olive, and Purple Fog variants of the Braided Solo Loop band.\n\nThe new Apple iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands are available immediately.",

Thus, there is officially less than half a year until its successor, the iPhone 15, is unveiled. But this does not stop industry insiders from giving us a sneak peek behind the curtain.\n\nToday, the latest rumor regarding Apple's flagship for 2023 surfaced on Twitter. User @lipilipsi, who is not a particularly well-known source, posted an image which supposedly showcases a number of iPhone 15 chassis. The sketchy leak was subsequently covered by MacRumors in a dedicated article.",

                    "body": "If you've not treated yourself to an upgrade in a while - and like the colour yellow - Apple's new iPhone could tick all the right boxes.\n\nThe iPhone 14 launched late last year and there's good news for anyone yet to take the plunge. Apple has just announced a reboot of this popular device with it now coming in a brand new and very brash Yellow colour. When the iPhone 14 was first revealed back in September 2022 you could only purchase it in Midnight, Starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, Blue and Purple. But now there's that bright addition to add to the list.\n\nOther than that new shade, everything else is the same as before with this latest device featuring a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR screen that's covered in tough Ceramic Sheild glass. There's also a dual-lens camera that not only takes better images at night but also includes a new Action mode for shake-free videos - it even works when you take it for a jog.\n\n( Image: Apple)\n\nTucked under the hood is Apple's mighty A15 Bionic processor and owners should find this device provides some pretty epic battery life thanks to better efficiency from the chip. When things do run low it can be refilled via Apple's unique MagSafe charging which snaps to the rear case.\n\nTwo other new life-saving upgrades that arrived on the iPhone 14 range include Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite.\n\nAs the name suggests, Crash Detection spots when you've had a prang in your car and then sends an alert to contacts and the emergency services. A precise location is also included helping you get found faster.\n\nEmergency SOS could also be vital if you find yourself off the beaten track and in need of help as this service can send a text to space meaning there's no need for a mobile signal.\n\nThere are even pre-loaded alerts and messages should you find yourself injured and unable to tap out a text. Apple says this option will be free for the first two years - it's unclear what the cost will be after that.\n\nAlong with the standard model getting the new colour scheme, the larger iPhone 14 Plus is also getting that new yellow design with this device featuring a mighty 6.8-inch screen.\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \"The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.\"\n\nThe new iPhone 14 Yellow is out next week with prices starting from \u00a3849.",

                    "body": "Why it matters: The iPhone SE 3 was only released last year, but it already looks ancient due to its thick bezels, tiny screen and old design language. The iPhone SE 4 will be a much-needed upgrade that is expected to give Apple's entry-level iPhone the modern touch that it so badly needs.\n\nApple's iPhone SE 4 could use OLED screens from a Chinese supplier instead of Samsung or LG. The report comes from South Korean publication The Elec, which says BOE (Beijing Oriental Electronics) is likely to supply the display panels for Apple's next entry-level iPhone that is expected to debut in 2024.\n\nThe Chinese supplier was also expected to provide display panels for the iPhone 15 but reportedly failed to deliver the initial batch of screens according to Apple's specifications, resulting in a mass cancellation of the order. The company is now only expected to supply screens for the iPhone SE 4; iPhone 15 orders are likely to be passed on to Samsung and LG.\n\nThe report adds that the iPhone SE 4 is expected to have a 6.1-inch OLED screen that could cost Apple around $40 a pop. If that's accurate, it would be less that half the $100 price that Apple paid for the LTPO OLED panels used in the iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nThe total number of OLED panel shipments for the iPhone SE 4 are estimated to be around 20 million.\n\nApple uses OLED panels in all its mainstream iPhones, with the iPhone SE (2022) being the only one to still use an LCD screen. That is expected to change this year, with Apple tipped to transition to OLED for its entire iPhone lineup, including the budget model. However, to save costs, the iPhone SE 4 is said to get the same panels that were used in the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14.\n\nIf that assertion holds up, it would mean that the device would get a 6.1-inch OLED screen with 2,532 x 1,170 pixel resolution and a 60Hz refresh rate. This would be in line with analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's recent suggestion that the new iPhone SE will be similar to the iPhone 14. In addition, the iPhone SE 4 is also tipped to sport Apple's in-house 5G baseband chip as Apple tries to reduce its dependence on third-party suppliers.",

                    "body": "A new study conducted by Counterpoint Research shows Apple has eight out of 10 best-selling smartphones of 2022. While you could think Samsung Galaxy S22 models could fill the other two spots, they're actually composed of the Galaxy A13 and A03 options.\n\nAccording to the research, the top-1o list contributed 19% of the total global smartphone sales in 2022, which is the same as in 2021. The numbers show the regular iPhone 13 model was the best-selling smartphone of the year, contributing 28% of iPhone sales.\n\nThe regular iPhone 13 was the number one smartphone in China, the US, the UK, Germany, and France. IT remained the number one each month from its launch in September 2021 till August 2022. After the iPhone 13, Apple follows the list with the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Here are the top 10 best-selling smartphones of 2022:\n\nCounterpoint Research notes that for the first time, a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models in 2022, meaning it helped Apple's iPhone 14 Pro Max to capture the third spot in the 2022 list.\n\nThis model was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October, and November 2022, thanks to early adopters and the new features, including the Dynamic Island and faster processor, while the regular iPhone 14 models were almost identical to the previous year's model.\n\nLast but not least, the iPhone 12, which was the best-selling smartphone of 2021, was the oldest model in the top 10 smartphones for 2022. Counterpoint says its sales remained \"robust\" in the US, Japan, and China. The study pointed out that its price cut increased its value proposition while its 5G capability also played an important role.\n\nFor 2023, the publication expected the share of the top 10 smartphones will increase \"as brands focus on clearing inventory and optimizing their launches.\"",

                    "body": "The iPhone 15 series may have a uniform display design, unlike last year's when Apple replaced the notch on the Pro iPhone models with the Dynamic Island.\n\nApple is reportedly planning to equip the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus with the Dynamic Island, marking an end for the notch entirely from Apple's flagship iPhone series. This year's iPhone series, hence, may have a uniform display design, unlike last year's when Apple replaced the notch on the Pro iPhone models with the Dynamic Island. The display sizes of each iPhone model, however, will likely remain the same. Also Read - Apple iPhone 15 Pro might ditch 2 buttons for volume control\n\nAccording to tipster ShrimpApplePro, the iPhone 15 series would come with a Dynamic Island design. The tipster tweeted a video showing off the front design of the upcoming iPhone models. The video shows three glass casings belonging to at least three iPhone models. Three glass casings with the Dynamic Island design mean that the design will reach beyond the Pro iPhone models this year. Also Read - Apple iPhone 15 likely to feature USB Type-C, but with restrictions: Check details here\n\nThe video of glass casings corroborates the previous speculation. Earlier, renowned analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the entire iPhone 15 series would come with the Dynamic Island design on the display. It is, however, unclear if the non-Pro iPhone models would get a display refresh rate bump.\n\nBesides the change in the display, the tipster previously said that the iPhone 15 series would feature a USB-C port, accredited by Apple's Made for iPhone standard. While the USB-C port on an iPhone would display Apple's compliance with the rulings against the exclusive charging mechanism in Europe and India, the MFi programme would make it hard to use any USB-C cable to charge the iPhone. According to reports, Apple could limit charging speed and other aspects when using a non-Apple or other incompatible USB-C cable with the iPhone 15 series.\n\nPublished Date: March 7, 2023 11:00 PM IST For the latest tech news across the world, latest PC and Mobile games, tips & tricks, top-notch gadget reviews of most exciting releases follow Techlusive India's Facebook, Twitter, subscribe our YouTube Channel.

In addition to the shape of the screen, you can also see the new Face ID sensor next to the camera; And if they end up being true, we could be facing the most anticipated redesign of Apple devices.\n\nSaran Byte was the one who shared the images on her official Twitter account, and comments that they were first filtered in Weibo. Here, he talks about the various changes coming with the panels of the new iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max.\n\nByte comments in his tweet on two important points that he has noticed in the leak of the screens. The first of these, as he declares, are the slightly reduced frames that would arrive with the device compared to previous models. It is not specified, yes, how much the reduction is.\n\nThe second major change is a growth in the aspect ratio of the screen. This means that it has gone from the 19.5:9 that we find in the current models, to the 20:9 that will supposedly arrive in the Pro models of the iPhone 14. This translates into a slightly taller screen than previous generations.\n\nIn addition, in the same image we can see changes in the base models of the iPhone 14. Until now, everything seems to indicate that Apple has discarded the model mini that he introduced with the generation of 12, and has turned it into a Max model. This means that, in the next generation, we would see two Max models, one standard and one Pro.\n\nPrevious rumors ensure that all models of this next generation will arrive with 120 Hz screens. In addition, They will have a 6 GB RAM memory. Until now, this capacity had been reserved for the Pro models, while the standard ones had settled for a maximum of 4 GB. Others point out that the iPhone 14 will have the same A15 chip as the 13 and 13 Pro; while the 14 Pro and Pro Max would integrate the next generation of the processor.\n\nOn the other hand, it is rumored that the design materials would also see changes. According to various sources, The iPhone 14 will adopt a titanium alloy bodya material that until now we had not seen in any Apple model.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that so far everything these are just rumors. Therefore, make sure you take all the information you find on the internet with a grain of salt. We'll still have to wait for the company to officially announce its new iPhone lineup, but that's a few months away. However, WWDC 2022 is very close, and here the company will present a lot of news about its systems, and perhaps some surprises.",

                    "body": "With the launch of iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models, Apple is widening the gap between its standard and 'Pro' models. This is one of the reasons why the iPhone 14 saw fewer sales compared to the iPhone 13. The company will potentially keep offering differentiating elements as far as the design is concerned. We have recently come to know that even though the iPhone 15 will share Dynamic Island with the iPhone 15 Pro, only the latter will feature a higher refresh rate or ProMotion display.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro models brought a bevy of forward-facing changes that allowed it to stand tall in comparison to the standard models. According to \"yeux1122\", the iPhone 15 Pro models will continue to feature Always-On capabilities along with a higher refresh rate display while the standard models will stick to a 60Hz display.\n\nA higher refresh rate display on the 'Pro' models uses an LTPO panel that consumes less power and can switch between 1Hz and 120Hz to preserve battery life. As mentioned earlier, Apple wants the high-end features to be reserved for the 'Pro' models. Nonetheless, Dynamic Island is a more than welcome addition that could boost sales.\n\nThe reason why iPhone 14 demand remains low is the lack of innovation in terms of design. Users still preferred to buy the iPhone 13 instead of the iPhone 14 because it practically gives the same outlook. Additionally, the iPhone 13 prices were slashed which further enticed users. Internally, both phones come with the A15 Bionic chip as well which narrowed down users to get their hands on the previous model.\n\nAs for what you can expect this year, the iPhone 15 Pro models will continue to rock the ProMotion LTPO panel with Always-On capabilities. Additionally, the 'Pro' models are also slated to feature solid-state buttons instead of mechanical buttons. Recent CAD renders have also hinted at the idea of a single elongated volume button instead of two separate buttons. Furthermore, the mute switch is also reported to adopt a solid-state approach instead of a mechanical switch.\n\nShare your thoughts with us in the comments below.",

                    "body": "Apple has introduced a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus that will be added to their existing color options this spring.\n\nBoth models feature a durable Ceramic Shield front cover, an updated internal design for better performance, and longer battery life, with the iPhone 14 Plus having the longest battery life of any iPhone ever.\n\nThe smartphones also come equipped with a dual-camera system for impressive photography and videography, the A15 Bionic chip, and advanced safety features, such as Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection.\n\nPre-orders for the new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus begin on Friday, March 10th, with the devices available for purchase starting on Tuesday, March 14th.\n\nRead Also: Microsoft Outlook is Available on Apple Macs for Free: No More Microsoft 365 Subscription or Office Purchase Needed\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, said in a press release statement.\n\n\"The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer to make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.\"\n\nStarting March 10th at 8 AM Eastern, customers in over 60 countries, including the US, UK, and Canada, will be able to pre-order the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nThe new models will be available on March 14th and will come alongside new silicone case colors that include a canary yellow.\n\nAlthough the iPhone 5c and iPhone 11 had yellow options, the modern iPhone design has not been available in this color until now. Previously, customers had to settle for subdued tones outside of Product Red models.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus comes with a durable aerospace-grade aluminum design that is water- and dust-resistant, with a Ceramic Shield front cover that is tougher than any other smartphone glass.\n\nThis provides protection from common spills and accidents. Additionally, both models include an updated internal design for better sustained performance, making them suitable for heavy workloads and high-powered gaming.\n\nThe Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology supports 1200 nits of peak HDR brightness, along with support for Dolby Vision.\n\nThe larger display on the iPhone 14 Plus is ideal for watching content, streaming Apple Fitness+ workouts, and playing games. It boasts the longest battery life of any iPhone ever, making it ideal for extended use.\n\nBoth models include a dual-camera system for capturing stunning photos and videos, the powerful A15 Bionic chip, and innovative safety features such as Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection.\n\nApple's iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come in six colors, including midnight, starlight, red, blue, purple, and the all-new yellow.",

                    "body": "iPhone 14: Camera, battery to display, 6 things to know if you are eyeing a Christmas buy\n\nThere's good news for Apple fans, especially those who are looking to buy the new iPhone 14 or the iPhone 14 Plus in spanking new avatars. There is a new color of the iPhone in town and it's bright and yellow! This year, Apple launched its non-Pro variants in four color options of Midnight, Starlight, Product RED, Blue and Purple. However, apart from the classic red, rest of the colors carried a muted aesthetic. But if you prefer your iPhone in snappy and bright colors, the color yellow has now officially been announced by Apple for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models.\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing while announcing the new colorway. The new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available to pre-order this Friday, March 10, with availability starting Tuesday, March 14.\n\nApple announces one bonus colorway for its iPhones every year. Last year, the iPhone 13 and the iPhone 13 Mini got the green color whereas the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max received the Alpine Green color.. But the yellow color is special. The last time the color yellow was seen on an iPhone was in 2019 with the iPhone 11 series. The new colorways are usually done to boost the product sales midway through its life cycle.\n\nIt should be noted that the new colorway for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus is only an aesthetic upgrade and rest of the specifications for the smartphones remain exactly the same. The price of the new colorways will also be the same with the iPhone 14 starting at Rs. 79900 and the iPhone 14 Plus starting at Rs. 89900.\n\nThe iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display while the iPhone 14 Plus comes with a 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display. Both the smartphones are equipped with the A15 Bionic chipset with a 5-core GPU and a 6-core CPU and sport a dual rear camera setup with a 12MP primary and a 12MP ultrawide camera. The smartphones come with the latest version of iOS 16 out of the box and carry new features like emergency SOS via satellite and crash detection system built inside it.",

                    "body": "The wallpaper from the newly launched yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus is now available for download. Get it right here.\n\nApple released the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in yellow just a while back. And with a new color comes a new wallpaper, too. That wallpaper will be available to those who buy the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in yellow, but you don't have spend money on a new phone at all as the wallpaper is available to download right now for free.\n\nClick or tap on the wallpaper below and save it directly to your device in full quality.\n\nIf you've ever bought a colored iPhone before, you already know what you're dealing with here. Apple has detached itself from reality completely when it comes to wallpapers and ships continuous shapes and gradients instead. That's not a bad thing, obviously. If you're looking for mountains or maybe a photo of the moon, you are not going to find it with the yellow iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nThe wallpaper is pretty big in size and should look nice on any phone you may have. And since the wallpaper is made to be used in a portrait orientation, therefore you might want to avoid using it on something like the Galaxy Fold unless you don't mind looking at blown up pixels on the display.\n\nComing back to the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus itself, both phones will be available to pre-order on March 10 and will begin to arrive at doorsteps on the 14th of the same month. Do keep in mind that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus ship with an SoC that was released back in 2021, but thanks to the extra GPU core, it's still a screamer. In fact, benchmarks show that this phone still manages to trash a lot of Android flagships out there. Phone that were released this year, to be exact.\n\nPersonally, I would recommend pushing the budget a little further and go for the iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max instead. Both those phones feature the Dynamic Island instead of the notch, you get the ProMotion 120Hz display, an extra camera, an always-on display and so much more.\n\nIf you really don't care about the latest and greatest, and color is your top-most priority, then the yellow phone from Apple is for you. Just make sure you get your order in on time if you want it at your doorstep on the 14th.",

This is despite the expectation that the iPhone 15 will get Dynamic Island.\n\nAccording to a post on Naver by yeux1122, only the iPhone 15 Pro series will support the LTPO 120Hz refresh rate.\n\nTranslation:\n\nApple has already completed preparations for the delivery of the iPhone 15 series diff panel to domestic companies, and it is said that it will confirm details sooner or later and prepare for mass production. What is confirmed here is that only the pro series supports the LTPO 120 refresh rate, and the basic general plus model does not have that content in the requirements .\n\nWhile unconfirmed, this could be a feature that Apple will use to distinguish between standard and pro models. Display analyst Ross Young predicted the same thing last year. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro are both expected to get Dynamic Island, Ceramic Shield, and a 28nm OLED driver, but rumors suggest the iPhone 15 Pro will have thinner bezels, solid state buttons, and 8GB of RAM.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro will likely utilize an A17 Bionic chip made with TSMC's 3nm process, while the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will stick with the A16 Bionic and 6GB of RAM. All four models will purportedly have a USB-C port and Qualcomm's 5G Snapdragon X70 modem.\n\nFinally, it's predicted the iPhone 15 Pro Max will feature a periscope telephoto lens for better optical zoom while the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus could get a 48MP rear camera lens.\n\nCheck out the latest leaked photo, renders, and front glass, then please download the iClarified app or follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and RSS for more updates.",

                    "body": "Rumor has it that the Dynamic Island feature will appear on all upcoming iPhone 15 models, not just the Pro.\n\nThis one has been in the rumor mill for years now, but in 2023 the switch from a Lightning Port to a USB-C port could finally happen. That's possibly due to pressure from the European Union, which has been pushing for a common charging standard for years. In 2022, the bloc managed to pass legislation requiring Apple to equip its iPhones with USB-C ports by 2024 if it wants to sell them in the EU.\n\nThe question is whether Apple will switch all iPhone models to USB-C or just those sold in the EU. Apple already modifies iPhone models regionally, as it has done with the iPhone 14: The US version has an electronic SIM, while other variants retain the SIM slot. However, there are good reasons to move all iPhones to USB-C moving forward, according to Avi Greengart, analyst at Techsponential.\n\n\"...There are larger ecosystem, security, and accessory considerations with the power/data connector, so I think it is more likely that Apple moves all iPhones [globally] to USB-C in the iPhone 16 timeframe to comply with European regulations,\" he told CNET in an email.\n\nRead more: Your Next iPhone Will Probably Need a Different Charging Cable\n\nApple is likely to continue selling four iPhone models with the iPhone 15 lineup. Rumors point to a generally similar design across the board, except that the iPhone 14 Pro's shape-shifting cutout, known as Dynamic Island, is set to make its way across all models.\n\nThat rumor comes from display analyst Ross Young, who also said in a September tweet that he's not expecting base iPhone 15 models to have a higher refresh rate like Apple's Pro iPhones because the supply chain can't support it.\n\nRead more: iPhone 14 Pro's Most Eye-Catching Feature Feels Like It's Winking at Something Else\n\nNoted Apple observer Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with TF International Securities, expects Apple to differentiate further between its base and Pro models in the coming years. One way he's expecting that to happen is by giving the iPhone 15 Pro models solid-state volume and power buttons instead of the standard keys present on today's devices, he wrote in a tweet in October.\n\nThe solid-state buttons, which Kuo says will be similar to the home button found on the iPhone SE and iPhone 7, mimic the feel of pressing a button with the help of haptic feedback. The apparent advantage of this type of button is that it also protects against water getting in.\n\nAccording to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce, Pro models of the iPhone 15 lineup will get a bump up in RAM to 8GB from 6GB to complement the anticipated A17 Bionic chipset. Base models will continue to receive 6GB RAM, according to TrendForce. This rumor is also apparently backed up by a research report from analyst Jeff Pu of Haitong International Securities, according to a MacRumors article, which referenced Pu's report.\n\nYet another Kuo prediction has been making the rounds, but this time it's about the iPhone 15's camera. The analyst forecasts that the iPhone 15 Pro Max will receive a periscope-style telephoto lens. This sort of telephoto lens allows for higher optical zoom levels, with Kuo forecasting a 6x optical zoom could arrive in the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The optical zoom on the iPhone 14 Pro Max is limited to 3x, which lags rivals such as the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra's 10x optical zoom.\n\nRead more: The iPhone 14 Pro's Camera Upgrade is Bigger Than You Think\n\nPrices have dramatically increased since the original iPhone arrived in 2007. And that may happen again in 2023 with the iPhone 15, except not in the way you might think. The price of the regular iPhone 15 is currently expected to remain the same, according to analysts who previously spoke with CNET.\n\nHowever, the upper limit of the price range could be pushed higher if rumors about a luxe iPhone 15 Ultra turn out to be true. The rumored Ultra model could potentially replace the iPhone 15 Pro Max next year, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman writes. This falls in line with predictions from Kuo, who expects Apple to differentiate further between the iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max models. US prices currently range from $829 for the entry-level iPhone 14 model (128GB) all the way up to $1,599 for the highest-end iPhone 14 Pro Max with 1TB of storage.\n\nRead more: What Apple Could Do With iPhone 15 Prices in 2023\n\nApple holds its annual iPhone event in September almost every year, so we'd expect the timeline to remain the same for the iPhone 15. New iPhones typically get released shortly thereafter, usually the Friday of the following week. Sometimes Apple will stagger release dates for specific models, especially when introducing a new design or size. So it's possible that the iPhone 15 lineup will have more than one release date.",

                    "body": "Though the rumours already covered the launch of the new Yellow variants of the iPhone 14 series, as a part of the Spring launch event. However, Apple made a paper launch of the new Yellow variant of the iPhone 14 series rather than unveiling it in the April launch event as its formal Spring event that takes place every April or March.\n\nThis is a habit of the Cupertino giant to bring a new color variant of its existing iPhone series in Spring, previously it brought Purple, Green and now Yellow. As a strategy to lure customers towards flaunting new color variants, it works pretty well for the Cupertino giant.\n\nThe new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available to pre-order this Friday, March 10, with availability starting Tuesday, March 14.\n\nAgain apart from the new color, the core functionality remains the same so, the yellow iPhone 14 will come with incredible battery life, a powerful dual-camera system for pro-level photos and videos, and groundbreaking safety capabilities, including Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection.\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing.",

                    "body": "The big picture: Apple's iPhone 13 was the best-selling smartphone of 2022, accounting for five percent of global smartphone sales for the year. Even more impressive is the fact that Apple handsets captured eight spots in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research's smartphone sales tracker, the top three best-selling smartphones last year were from Apple: the aforementioned iPhone 13, the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the iPhone 14 Pro Max, in that order.\n\nThe research firm said the iPhone 13 made up 28 percent of iPhone sales and was the best-selling phone each month from its launch in September 2021 through August 2022, just before the launch of the iPhone 14 series. The iPhone 14 Pro Max took over the top spot in September and held it through November, with the standard iPhone 14 claiming the number one position in the final month of 2022.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy A13 captured the fourth position overall for 2022 but after that, it was five more iPhones in succession. Samsung's Galaxy A03 made it onto the board in 10th place with a 1.1 percent share of the total market.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy A13 and Galaxy A03 are both entry-level models, and the only two phones on the list that do not support 5G connectivity. Both performed well in developing markets like India, Caribbean and Latin America (CALA), the Middle East and Africa.\n\nCollectively, the phones in the top 10 accounted for 19 percent of total global smartphone sales in 2022. Counterpoint believes the collective market share of the top 10 handsets will increase this year as companies look to clear out inventory and optimize product launches.\n\nFurthermore, the research firm expects brands to continue to lean out their portfolios in an effort to minimize cannibalization. We have already seen this happening over the past couple of years as the number of active smartphone models on the market has fallen from north of 4,200 in 2021 to near 3,600 last year.",

Apart from a new colour option, the next iPhone 14 model will be functionally similar to the current generation. The colour seems to be extremely close to the yellow iPhone XR in the product photos.\n\nExpect the new iPhone 14 option to be light on the yellow and have a slightly golden frame if the colour turns out to be the same as the iPhone XR. Pre-orders for the new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus begin on March 10, with the devices themselves hitting store shelves on March 14.\n\nThe 128GB version of Apple's new iPhone 14, which has a 6.1-inch display, costs Rs 79,999, while the 512GB version costs Rs 119,900. The iPhone 14 Plus, which has a bigger 6.7-inch display, begins at Rs 10,000 more, or Rs 89,000.\n\nAlso, READ: Apple iPhone SE 4 to feature OLED panel from Chinese display manufacturer BOE\n\nAt the same time last year, Apple had also revealed alpine green and green colour choices for the iPhone 13 series. The Pro models haven't been updated with the new colours for this year.",

                    "title": "The standard iPhone 15 may lack two of the iPhone 14 Pro's biggest features",
                    "body": "The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are rumored to inherit a handful of high-end features from the iPhone 14 Pro, but the latter's ProMotion technology and always-on display functionality are unlikely to be among that number.\n\nWhile Apple's Dynamic Island is set to trickle down to the standard iPhone 15 and its larger sibling, a new leak (opens in new tab) (H/T MacRumors (opens in new tab)) suggests that the two handsets will stick with the traditional 60Hz display panel sported by their predecessors-to-be, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nFor those not in the know, both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max boast adaptive 1-120Hz refresh rate technology (dubbed ProMotion) that automatically adjusts the smoothness of their displays to suit whatever's happening on-screen. Apple's always-on display functionality relies on ProMotion to function, so it looks like both of those high-end features will again be reserved for the iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max and much-rumored iPhone 15 Ultra.\n\nSuffice to say, this is disappointing news for Apple fans. Always-on display technology has been available on many of the best Android phones for several years now, and it's frustrating to see that Apple will remain committed to maintaining such a large technological gap between its standard and Pro iPhones with the iPhone 15 line.\n\nIn fairness to Apple, the Dynamic Island isn't the only Pro-level feature that's expected to come to the company's new 'affordable' iPhones in September - rumor has it that the iPhone 14 Pr\u043e's high-res 48MP camera will likewise become a universal feature of the iPhone 15 range.\n\nHowever, for every once premium feature heading to the vanilla iPhone 15, there seem to be two more Pro-grade features heading to the iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max and Ultra. For instance, a top-of-the-line chip upgrade - likely in the form of an A17 Bionic - will inevitably be made exclusive to Apple's most expensive iPhones, while a titanium frame and periscope camera have also been touted as arriving with the iPhone 15 Ultra.\n\nIn other words, Apple's Pro-level iPhones are set to get even Pro-er, while its more affordable all-rounders continue to play catch-up. And while there's nothing inherently wrong with that strategy, the company's standard iPhones are rapidly losing their shine in the presence of more accomplished (and affordable) Android alternatives.\n\nWe'll be staying abreast of all the latest iPhone 15 news, rumors and leaks as and when they surface, so stay tuned to TechRadar for the most up-to-date info on what's likely to be 2023's hottest smartphone launch.",

Apple is launching a new yellow option for its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, adding yet another bright hue to what's long been our pick for the best smartphone.\n\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus Available soon in yellow Apple\n\nStarting on March 10, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available in a new yellow color option.\n\nFrom $799 at Apple\n\nYou can preorder the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus starting March 10, with general availability starting on March 14. This new color joins the existing blue, purple, midnight, starlight and (Product) Red options, giving you six total options to choose from. However, It doesn't look like the higher-end iPhone 14 Pro is getting any new colors this spring, so if you really like the color yellow, you'll have to stick with the base iPhone 14.\n\nApple's made a tradition of launching new iPhone colors every spring, with the iPhone 12 getting a purple option in 2021 and the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro getting various shades of green last year. It's unclear why the iPhone 14 Pro didn't get any love for this spring refresh, though Apple's highest-end phone has suffered from general supply constraints.\n\nApple\n\nNew color aside, this is the same exact iPhone 14 that launched last fall -- and that's not a bad thing. In our iPhone 14 review, we loved the phone's excellent camera (which especially excels for video and low-light photography), long battery life and zippy performance. You also get the same promising safety features as the higher-end Pro models, including Crash Detection that can automatically get you help in the event of a car accident and an Emergency SOS texting feature that lets you contact emergency services without a cell signal.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Plus is essentially the same phone as the iPhone 14, but with a larger 6.7-inch display and slightly longer rated battery life. If you're due for an upgrade, the latest iPhones are our go-to option for most people -- and if you especially love the color yellow, now's the time to grab one.",

                    "body": "In 2022, Apple became the first brand to capture eight spots in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones, according to Counterpoint Research's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker. The remaining two spots were taken by iPhone knockoff-maker Samsung. The top-10 list comprised 19% of the total global smartphone sales in 2022, the same as in 2021.\n\nApple's iPhone 13 was the best-selling smartphone of 2022, contributing 28% of iPhone sales. It was the best-selling smartphone in major markets such as China, US, UK, Germany and France. Further, the iPhone 13 remained the number one smartphone each month from its launch in September 2021 till August 2022. Price cuts after the iPhone 14 series' launch further drove the iPhone 13 volumes in developing markets. The iPhone 13 sales were two times more than that of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the second best-selling smartphone in 2022.\n\nGlobal Top 10 Best-selling Smartphones Unit Sales Share and Monthly Rankings, 2022\n\nFor the first time, a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models in 2022. It helped the iPhone 14 Pro Max to capture the third spot in the 2022 list. It was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October and November of 2022. The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant. Major advancements in the iPhone 14 Pro series, such as dynamic island and faster processor, make it more attractive, as the base model is almost identical to the previous year's model.\n\nMacDailyNews Take: Even before the iPhone 14 range was unveiled, we predicted heavy demand for the Pro models and a stronger iPhone ASP over prior years because Apple was heavily rumored to be better differentiating the 14 Pro/Max over the base models.\n\nApple should have been doing this prior, but it's good to see some additional differentiation between entry-level and \"Pro\" iPhone which will, of course, tilt more buyers to iPhone Pro models, increasing Apple's iPhone ASP. The expected removal of the inelegant kludge (notch) in favor of a more refined pill and hole punch design exclusively in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max will also help differentiate the Pro models from the non-Pro iPhones later this year, moving the mix toward higher-end iPhones. - MacDailyNews, July 6, 2022\n\nApple iPhone mix is easily going to be the strongest ever. Do not be surprised with the reports that Apple has \"cut iPhone 14 orders,\" meaning iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The company will likely be increasing iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max orders to reflect the strong mix which bodes very well, of course for Apple's iPhone average selling price (ASP). - MacDailyNews, September 14, 2022\n\nThe iPhone 12, the best-selling smartphone of 2021, was the oldest model in the top 10 for 2022. Its sales remained robust in the US, Japan and China. The price cuts with each year's new iPhone launch increased its value proposition while its 5G capability also played an important role. The iPhone SE 2022, among the most compact phones in the industry, grabbed the tenth spot. Like its predecessor, it managed to sell well in Japan.\n\nWith its entry-level models Galaxy A13 and Galaxy A03, Samsung took two spots on the list, one more than the previous year. The two models were the only LTE smartphones to make it to the list.\n\nOffering attractive specifications for its price (<$250), the Galaxy A13, like its predecessor, continued to perform well. Caribbean and Latin America (CALA), followed by India, contributed the most to its sales. The Galaxy A03 was the most affordable smartphone on the list and the only one powered by UNISOC. The smartphone performed well in developing regions like CALA and the Middle East and Africa (MEA).",

                    "body": "The iPhone SE 4 will reportedly feature a 6.1-inch OLED panel supplied by BOE.\n\niPhone SE 4 is expected to launch in March 2024, according to the latest reports in the rumour mills. Unlike the regular iPhones, the SE series doesn't have a fixed schedule and can be launched anytime next year. Notably, Apple launched the first iPhone SE in 2016, the iPhone SE 2 in 2020, and the iPhone SE 5G in 2022. Apart from the launch timeline, the iPhone SE 4 display panel details have also been leaked. Here's what we know as of now.\n\nIf the report by The Elec is to be believed, the iPhone SE 4 will come with a 6.1-inch OLED panel manufactured by BOE. This means no more sub-standard LCD panels for iPhone SE series fans. While this is an upgrade from LCD panels of the past, it won't be the same panel as the 6.1-inch OLED panel on iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro, which LG or Samsung manufactures.\n\nHowever, this move from Apple is logical since the OLED panel manufactured by BOE will cost the tech giant only $40 (~Rs 3,270). In contrast, the panels used on the upcoming iPhone 15 series and OLED iPads by Samsung Display and LG Display cost around $100 (~Rs 8,175). This means the BOE display costs less than half its premium counterparts and will help Apple launch it with a competitive price tag.\n\nThe reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently stated that the iPhone SE 4 would flaunt a proprietary Apple 5G chip. He also confirmed that the phone would feature a 6.1-inch OLED display, which aligns with the latest information. Kuo also confirmed that the upcoming SE-series iPhone would flaunt an iPhone 14-like design with thin bezels.\n\nRecent rumours have also suggested that the iPhone SE 4 might feature the same chassis as the iPhone 14 and some of its components. This means it might also share some specifications with its more expensive sibling. We can expect the BOE display panel to be an LTPO unit with a 60Hz refresh rate and a display notch.",

                    "body": "The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus get a new Yellow colour option. It is the sixth colour option in the non-Pro iPhone lineup. The iPhone 14 series is available at a starting price of Rs 79,900.\n\nApple has announced a new colour for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The new iPhone is now available in a shade of Yellow. The latest iPhone was unveiled last year in September in multiple colour options, including midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT) RED, blue, and purple. The new sixth colour option for the non-Pro iPhones will be available in three storage options. Other than the new colour, the iPhone 14 Yellow has the same price and specifications as the other colour options.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Yellow colour option will go on sale from March 14. Those who wish to grab their hands on the new colour can pre-order it from March 10. Here's a quick look at the iPhone 14, 14 Plus prices in India, specifications and other details.\n\nThe new iPhone 14 series Yellow colour option is exclusive to the non-Pro models. Apple has confirmed that the yellow colour option will be available in India. Customers in India, Australia, Canada, the UK and over 60 other countries can buy the yellow iPhone from March 14. In India, the pre-order window opens at 6.30 pm IST on March 10.\n\nThe new iPhone colour option will be available at a starting price of Rs 79,900 for the base 128GB storage option. It can also be bought in 256GB and 512GB storage options. The 256GB storage option has a launch price of Rs 89,900, whereas the 512GB variant attracts a price tag of Rs 1,09,900.\n\nThe new colour option is more of a flaunt factor that helps the new iPhone stand out from the rest of the lineup. Moreover, since the iPhone 14 shares its design with the iPhone 13 series, it will further help distinguish between the two series.\n\nAs mentioned above, the yellow colour option of the iPhone has the same hardware as the rest of the non-Pro lineup. This means that the iPhone 14 sports a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display with a 2532\u00d71170-pixel resolution, whereas the 14 Plus has a 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display with a 2778\u00d71284-pixel resolution. Both models sport a notch at the top for the Face ID sensors and the front camera. The display has a claimed peak brightness of 1200 nits and supports a standard 60Hz refresh rate.\n\nOther than the display size, the 14 Plus has a bigger battery, which Apple claims is the best ever in an iPhone. It is claimed to offer up to 26 hours. The iPhone 14, on the other hand, is claimed to offer up to 20 hours of battery life.\n\nThe iPhone 14 series has an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. Both models support 15W MagSafe charging, 20W wired fast charging and 7.5W wireless charging support.\n\nThe latest iPhone boots iOS 16 out of the box. The 14 and 14 Plus also feature an A15 Bionic SoC with a five-core GPU. The devices also feature a dual-camera setup with a 12MP f/1.5 main camera with support for sensor-shift optical image stabilisation. There is also a 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 120-degree field of view. For selfies, the 14 and 14 Plus feature a 12MP front camera with support for autofocus. The devices also support crash detection and Emergency SOS.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the new yellow colour option of the iPhone 14 series? Let us know in the comments below.",

                    "body": "Apple has this feeling that is indeed so appealing, and that feeling is that they need to add \"yellow\" to its slate of iPhone case colors. Alright, sing it with me, kids: \"ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.\"\n\nApple announced its new yellow-tinted phones Tuesday. It's thankfully not a full-vibrant mustard color, but a subdued, soothing pastel tone. Everything else about the already solid iPhone 14 and 14 Plus remains the same, of course. The new color option should be available \"this spring,\" according to the company's announcement.\n\nApple tends to keep certain colors specific to certain phone iterations. Remember when rose gold was the big thing? Last March, Apple put out an \"alpine green\" iPhone 13 and 13 Pro, a dark green color which seemed geared more toward folks who wear forest military camouflage patterns when walking around cities without any trees in sight. Compared to that, the yellow iPhone 14 fits more in line with the classic, subdued Apple look.\n\nYellow joins the current slate of other colors, including \"midnight\" (dark gray), \"starlight\" (white), red, blue (really a grayish-blue), and (really light) purple. It will be interesting to see what kinds of color palettes Apple will release with its upcoming iPhone 15, although according to a new rumor, folks may be more hung up on the next Apple phone's screen hardware.\n\nAs first reported by MacRumors, the standard model iPhone 15 won't include an LTPO screen, meaning it won't get the ProMotion features found in the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. According to Korean news aggregator blog yeux1122 on Tuesday, only the Pro series will get access to LTPO's 1-120hz refresh rate, which means the regular iPhone 15 won't get any kind of low-power display backlighting to maintain an always-on screen. The higher end iPhone Pro models can shift the refresh rate depending on whether it's displaying static content or videos, meaning it can maintain the device's rather long battery life without sacrificing visibility.\n\nAccording to the blog and previous reports from Apple analysts, Apple has already started delivering the iPhone 15 display components in preparation for mass production, so it's already too late for much to change. It's disappointing news for anybody who wasn't planning on dropping an extra $100 on a more expensive iPhone when they come next year.",

                    "body": "The iPhone 15 series should follow the same product launch strategy as the iPhone 14. That's what most rumors say, at least. The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will feature roughly the same specs as the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max will deliver big upgrades.\n\nThere is going to be one big difference between the 2022 and 2023 iPhone lineups. All iPhone 15 models will feature the same Dynamic Island design and functionality. But the cheaper models reportedly still won't get 120Hz OLED panels that enable features like ProMotion and the Always-on display.\n\nA leaker from Korea who has posted unconfirmed iPhone details in the past shared a rumor about the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus on Naver (via MacRumors ):\n\nApple is said to have already made arrangements to deliver iPhone 15 series display panels to domestic companies, and will soon finalize details and prepare for mass production. What is confirmed here is that only the Pro Series will have a specification that supports LTPO 120 refresh rate, with the basic regular Plus model not having it in its requirements.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max feature LTPO panels that support dynamic refresh rates between 1Hz and 120Hz. This lets Apple bring ProMotion support to the iPhone without impacting battery life. The phone knows when to raise the refresh rate, thus optimizing energy consumption. For even better battery life, iPhone users can set the maximum refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\nThat dynamic refresh rate also enables the Always-on display functionality. With the feature, the screen will refresh at 1Hz while it stays on to show Lock Screen widgets and notifications. The feature still consumes energy, so turning it off will further enhance battery life.\n\nOne reason Apple keeps 120Hz panels exclusive to the more expensive Pro models concerns costs. Especially if rumors that the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will be cheaper are accurate.\n\nBut, as MacRumors points out, well-known insiders may have already revealed the real reason why Apple can't equip all iPhone models with 120Hz panels this year.\n\nChinese display maker BOE will not be able to provide LTPO panels for iPhones until 2024 at the earliest. That's according to Ming-Chi Kuo, who has been a reliable Apple insider for years. Display analyst Ross Young also noted that production constraints would prevent Apple from using LPTO screens on all 2023 iPhone models.",

                    "body": "Apple had eight of the top ten best selling smartphones in 2022, becoming the first brand to do so, reports Counterpoint Research.\n\nIn 2022, Apple became the first brand to capture eight spots in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones, according to Counterpoint Research's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker. The remaining two spots were taken by Samsung. The top-10 list contributed 19% of the total global smartphone sales in 2022, the same as in 2021.\n\nCounterpoint says the iPhone 13 was the best selling smartphone last year, accounting for 28% of iPhone sales. The device dominated markets including the US, UK, China, Germany, and France. Additionally, it remained the number one smartphone from its launch in September 2021 until August 2022. After the release of the iPhone 14, price cuts to the iPhone 13 drove up its volumes in developing markets. Sales of the iPhone 13 over doubled that of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the second best selling smartphone of 2022.\n\nNotably, the iPhone 14 Pro Max was the first time a 'Pro Max' variant outperformed lower configurations.\n\nFor the first time, a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models in 2022. It helped the iPhone 14 Pro Max to capture the third spot in the 2022 list. It was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October and November of 2022. The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant. Major advancements in the iPhone 14 Pro series, such as dynamic island and faster processor, make it more attractive, as the base model is almost identical to the previous year's model.\n\nThe oldest model on the top ten list was the iPhone 12. Price cuts and 5G capability are said to have played a major role in its popularity for 2022. The iPhone SE 2022 also made the list, selling well in Japan.\n\nSamsung was the only other company to make the top ten list for 2022 with the Galaxy A13 and Galaxy A03.\n\nOffering attractive specifications for its price (\n\nFinally, Counterpoint expects the share of top ten smartphones to increase in 2023 as brands work to clear inventory and make their portfolios leaner. The number of active smartphone models in the global market fell from over 4,200 in 2021 to around 3,600 in 2022. That trend is likely to continue.\n\nHit the link below for the full report.",

The company did not announce any new colours for the iPhone 14 Pro models, however.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a durable aerospace-grade aluminium design that is water and dust-resistant, and a Ceramic Shield front cover that the company claims is tougher than any other smartphone glass. The phones also have a Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology and support for Dolby Vision. When it comes to the camera, the phones have a powerful dual-camera system that includes a pro-level main camera, an ultra-wide camera, and a new front TrueDepth camera.\n\nApart from the new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models, Apple is also releasing new colours for its silicone cases. The colours are canary yellow, olive, sky, and iris.\n\nBob Borchers, Apple's Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing, expressed his excitement about the new launch, stating that \"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\" He also highlighted the phone's \"extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer,\" making it a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.",

                    "body": "Apple had its best year in India and globally in 2022. It recorded a YoY growth of 11% in iPhone shipments even as it secured its highest ever market share of 5.5%, according to CyberMedia Research (CMR). On a global level, Apple captured the highest-ever share of smartphone shipments (18%), revenue (48%) and operating profit (85%) this year, as per Counterpoint Research. Now, a new report has claimed that people preferred iPhones over others - by a huge margin - last year.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker, Apple captured eight spots in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones for 2022 - becoming the first brand to do so. The remaining two spots were taken by Samsung.\n\nThe top 10 list contributed 19% of the total global smartphone sales in 2022, the same as in 2021, the report said.\n\niPhone 13 was best selling smartphone\n\niPhone 13 was the best selling smartphone of 2022 as it contributed 28% of iPhone sales. The smartphone was the best-selling smartphone in markets including China, the US, the UK, Germany and France.\n\nInterestingly, iPhone 13 remained at the top spot each month since its launch in September 2021 till August 2022. Furthermore, price cuts after the iPhone 14 series' launch further drove the iPhone 13 volumes in developing markets.\n\nThe report also mentions that iPhone 13 sales were two times more than that of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which was the second best-selling smartphone in 2022.\n\niPhone 13 Pro Max drove more volume than other models\n\nCounterpoint said that this was the first time that a Pro Max model of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models in 2022. The iPhone 14 Pro Max captured the third spot in the 2022 list. It was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October and November of 2022.\n\nWhy was the iPhone 14 Pro Max a hit?\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant. Advancements such as dynamic island and faster processor, and \"almost identical\" design of base models to the previous year's offerings, helped the smartphone gain popularity.\n\nThe fourth spot was captured by Samsung Galaxy A13. Apart from this, the Galaxy A03 also made the cut to the top 10 list. Incidentally, the two models were the only LTE smartphones to make it to the list.\n\nThe Galaxy A13 performed well due to its price and specifications. Caribbean and Latin America (CALA), followed by India, contributed the most to its sales. Galaxy A03 performed well in developing regions like CALA and the Middle East and Africa (MEA).\n\nOther phones in the list include iPhone 12, the best-selling smartphone of 2021 and the oldest model in top 10 for 2022. iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone SE (20222) also made the cut in the list.",

                    "body": "READ MORE: Apple cuts production of the new iPhone 14 by 6 million units\n\nApple on Tuesday introduced yellow versions of its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus to boost sales that have seen the biggest declines since 2019.\n\nUsers across over 60 countries, including the US and UK, can pre-order the new smartphones starting March 10.\n\nBoth will feature the same technology and pricing as the original lineup released in September 2022 - the devices start at $799 and $899.\n\nApple has used similar yellow shades in previous models - the iPhone 5c and iPhone 11 - but this is the first time the color has been seen on a modern device.\n\nThe move, however, is the tech giant's secret weapon to boost iPhone sales, which fell eight percent last year.\n\nApple has revealed a new bright yellow color for its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus\n\nBob Borchers, Apple's vice president of worldwide product marketing, said in a statement: 'People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\n\n'The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer to make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.'\n\nApple sales saw a major decrease at the end of 2022, as the cost of living increase forced consumers to choose between paying bills or purchasing the latest iPhone.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook said the firm was navigating a 'challenging environment' while blaming the sales decline on supply shortages due to Covid-19 disruption in China.\n\n'As the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances ... we know Apple is not immune to it,' he said on a conference call with investors last month.\n\nHowever, releasing a new color might boost Apple's bounce back.\n\nThe yellow versions will feature the same technology released on September 7, 2022 with the original iPhone 14 lineup.\n\nUsers across over 60 countries, including the US and UK, can pre-order the new smartphones starting March 10. The new color smartphones will hit the market on March 14\n\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, which boast a 6.7-inch screen, include a dual-camera system, the A15 Bionic chip and safety capabilities, including Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection.\n\nThe smartphones feature a sleek aerospace-grade aluminum design in five finishes and updated internal designs for better thermal performance.\n\nThe pair have a Ceramic Shield on the front cover that protects the inner workers from spills, water and dust.\n\nThe camera also has a 49 percent improvement in low-light capture and a new TrueDepth for the front-facing camera that automatically focuses on objects and people within the frame, along with the Ultra Wide camera that captures more of the scene\n\nThe new iPhone 14 family includes a software feature called 'Photonic Engine' that captures better details and color in low light.\n\nBoth will feature the same technology and pricing as the original lineup released in September 2022 - the devices start at $799 and $899\n\n'Through a deep integration of hardware and software, Photonic Engine improves mid- to low-light photo performance across all cameras: up to 2x on the Ultra Wide camera, 2x on the TrueDepth camera, and an impressive 2.5x on the new Main camera,' shared Apple.\n\n'Photonic Engine enables this dramatic increase in quality by applying the computational benefits of Deep Fusion earlier in the imaging process to deliver extraordinary detail, and preserve subtle textures, provide better color, and maintain more information in a photo.'\n\nThe video system was also upgraded with 'action' mode, keeping the footage stable even when shaky.\n\nApple's iPhone 14 did not make a wave like it had predicted, forcing it to cut the new smartphone by six million units just two weeks after its release.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Apple was forgoing an additional six million handsets this year on top of the already 90 million units that were produced in 2021.",

                    "body": "There are also new silicon cases for the iPhone and refreshed Apple Watch bands.\n\nJust as rumors predicted, Apple has introduced a new version of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus that comes with a yellow finish. In the company's press renders, the color way looks pretty nice, with a more premium accent than the yellow that graced the iPhone 11 a few years ago. Unfortunately, for those hoping for a yellow iPhone 14 Pro, you're out of luck as Apple isn't shipping one.\n\nBeyond the new finish, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus remain the same devices as before. You still get 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch notched OLED displays, A15 Bionic processors, dual rear cameras, MagSafe, stereo speakers, and long battery life. They're also priced the same as before, with the 14 starting at $799 while the 14 Plus starts at $899.\n\nIn addition to the new springtime color for the iPhone, Apple is also introducing new silicon cases and Apple Watch bands with some cheerful colors for the season. The new cases are available for the entire iPhone 14 line - including the Pros - and come in Canary Yellow, Olive, Sky, and Iris. Meanwhile, the colors vary across the Solo Loop, Braided Solo Loop, Sport Band, and Herm\u00e8s band lines, with finishes such as Sprout Green and Bright Orange.\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus go on sale Tuesday, March 14th. Preorders open this Friday at 8 a.m. ET/5 a.m. PT.",

He previously worked at Android Police, PC Gamer, and XDA Developers. Read more...\n\nApple introduced the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro in September 2022, but if you didn't already buy one, Apple is hoping a new color option might win you over. The phones are now available in a bright yellow color.\n\nApple has revealed a new yellow color for both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, which will be available to pre-order this Friday, March 10. Full availability starts on Tuesday, March 14. The phones were already available in \"Midnight\" (black), \"Starlight\" (beige/white), Product RED, blue, and purple. The existing colors didn't stand out from the crowd much, except the bright red of the Product RED option, so it's nice to see a bright yellow option enter the lineup.\n\nApple hasn't sold iPhones in a yellow color since the iPhone 11 in 2019, but the option was never available for the 11 Pro. Before that, the iPhone XR from 2018 had a yellow option. This release is something of a departure for Apple, which normally limits its Pro-branded products to understated or dim colors.\n\nIt's not unusual for Apple to introduce new color options for products that have already been released, and the company is probably hoping for a temporary sales boost. Apple's financial results for the last quarter of 2023 showed a slump in iPhone sales, but availability of some models (including the iPhone 14 Pro) was constrained by supply chain problems.\n\nThe new yellow color will be available for the same price as the other options. The iPhone 14 starts at $799, and the iPhone 14 Pro starts at $899.",

Last Spring, the company launched a new green color (Alpine green for the Pro models) for the iPhone 13 series, and in 2021, it unveiled a purple colorway for the iPhone 12 series.\n\nThe Cupertino-based phone maker already offers these devices in midnight (black), starlight, red, blue, and purple. I'm just sad they didn't call the new color \"banana\".\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing.\n\nDevices with the new color are available for pre-order from March 10 and they will be available starting March 14 in-store and online.\n\nAlong with this, the company is also launching new cases in Canary Yellow, Olive, Sky (light blue), and Iris (purple) colorways.\n\nWhat's more, Apple is adding new bands to the spring lineup. Users can buy a $49 solo loop in Canary Yellow, Olive, Purple Fog, and Sprout Green colorways; a $49 sports band in Sky, Bright Orange, and Olive colorways; and a $99 braided solo loop in Purple, Bright Orange, and Olive colorways.",

                    "body": "Apple is hoping to bring a little spring into the air with its upcoming launch of the new daffodil-colored yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The new color joins five existing iPhone 14 hues -- midnight (black), starlight (white), red, blue (which appears to be more of a dusty periwinkle), and pink. All of iPhone 14's colors, including yellow, are available in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage increments. The yellow phone, like its companions, comes with an IP68 water-resistance rating and a ceramic screen shield for heightened scratch and shatter protection.\n\nThe headline features of the newest iPhone remain the same in the new color. This includes emergency services such as satellite SOS communications when a cellular connection isn't available, vehicular crash detection, and what Apple purports as the best battery life in iPhones to date. The yellow iPhone 14 starts at $799 in the United States, and the 14 Plus's price tag for a baseline model is $899.",

                    "body": "To put it plainly, eSIMs transform mobile data and security. Apple first introduced eSIM support in September 2017 with the Apple Watch Series 3. The first iPhone models to support it were the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR in September 2018. The first iPad model was the iPad Pro (3rd generation) in October 2018.\n\nIn September 2022, Apple unveiled the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max, the first iPhone models not to have a SIM card tray and to work exclusively with eSIM. Outside the United States, all iPhone models continue to be sold with support for both eSIM and physical SIM cards.\n\nMacDailyNews Take: In mainland China eSIM still is not supported - very likely due to the CCP's continual need to control and surveil its populace lest it awaken en masse.\n\nAppAdvice:\n\nShort for Electronic Subscriber Identity Module, an eSIM is essentially a programmable SIM card.\n\nThat means it never has to leave your device... Instead, all you need to do when you want to change providers or go abroad is scan a quick QR code.\n\nPlus, with an eSIM you can stop worrying about data roaming. You'll know exactly where you can go and what it'll cost upfront, allowing you to cross borders for work or play without a care in the world.\n\nThat goes for security, too. Whether or not you realize it, your traditional SIM is a sitting duck when it comes to simjacking, SIM cloning, and SIM swaps.\n\nBy contrast, an eSIM is an impenetrable fortress, requiring an activation code and refusing to share personal information unless you explicitly allow it.\n\nMacDailyNews Take: With iPhone 14 Pro Max, we said a hearty goodbye and good riddance to swapping out tiny SIM cards when traveling internationally!",

                    "body": "Rumours of its existence have been flying around for the past week or so. As you can tell, it turned out to be absolutely true: Apple has just officially announced that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus can now be obtained in yellow which goes hand-in-hand with the upcoming spring season.\n\nThe new yellow option is the sixth colourway for both phones to date which previously were already available in Midnight, Starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, Blue, and Purple. The implementation was generally similar too, as Apple has draped the phone's frame in metallic yellow while the back features a slightly lighter shade of yellow but is still quite prominent - at least that is what we can see from the official product photos.\n\nAs you might expect, the arrival of the new yellow colourway did not change the price of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in Malaysia. Let us refresh your memory with the price list:\n\nEven though the new colour option has officially been announced for our market and has been listed on Apple Malaysia's website, you still to have wait for a little bit longer to get your hands on it. According to the website, pre-orders for the new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in Malaysia will only start on 10 March at 9:00 PM.\n\nTo purchase them outright, one has to wait until 14 March though. At the time this article is published, we have yet to see the new yellow colourway being offered by Apple Authorised Resellers (AAR) such as Machines and Switch, so you may want to reach out directly to them for further information if you prefer to purchase iPhone through them.",

Read update We updated the article to include the recently added new Yellow color to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. Quick Links Which iPhone color should you get? Best iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus colors Best iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max colors UPDATE: 03/07/2023 08:45 EST BY ROLAND UDVARLAKI\n\nWe updated the article to include the recently added new Yellow color to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nApple unveiled the latest iPhone 14 series on September 7, consisting of the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagship devices. The standard iPhone 14 series arrived with the powerful Apple A15 Bionic chip and came in several new color options. Apple also added a new colorway, Yellow, to the iPhone 14 lineup on March 7, 2023. In contrast, the iPhone 14 Pro series are powered by the latest Apple A16 Bionic chip, and received a new Deep Purple shade.\n\nPOCKETNOW VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\nIn this article, we'll take a closer look at the new iPhone 14 color options, and explain which one you should get and why. We have some excellent articles on the best cases for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus devices, and the best-rugged cases for the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max flagships.\n\nWhich iPhone color should you get?\n\nApple's current generation iPhone 14 series is available in several colors. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in five colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight (Black), Starlight (Silver/White), and Red. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships are available in four colors: Deep Purple, Gold, Silver, and Space Black.\n\nPicking between all of these options could be difficult, especially if you like two of these more than the others. We understand that picking the perfect color can be difficult, but we often recommend users to pick one that best expresses their unique self. If you're into fashion, it's also worth considering whether a bright purple device would fit you and your wardrobe, but luckily, that's not something that a case or a skin can't fix.\n\nWhat matters at the end of the day is that you pick something that you like and show off your unique self. Things don't always have to match perfectly, making things more fun.\n\nBest iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus colors Blue\n\nThe iPhone 12 introduced the bold new Blue color, and Apple has been working on toning it down ever since. As a result, the new Blue is more subtle and fits perfectly into the rest of the series and the other pale-ish colors. The new Blue shows us that it's a smart, attractive color and matches perfectly with the black bezels on the front.\n\nPurple\n\nThe Purple is a newly introduced shade for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, and it's quite light and pale. It's the perfect color to show off your classy, elegant, smart side, and it can suit you anytime, anywhere. This shade of pale purple is one of the most requested colors for the iPhone 14 series, and Apple returned it in 2022.\n\nMidnight\n\nMidnight is the fancy equivalent of Black, and it's one of the most popular colors. Most users often pick this color as it matches with all clothes, cases, and skins, and it's our go-to option if you're looking to change the looks of your phone every once in a while with a new case or a skin. It's an elegant and smart color, but we understand it's not for everyone due to its simplicity, as it might be considered \"boring\".\n\nStarlight\n\nStarlight is the other most popular color alongside Midnight. It's a white-ish, Silver shade, and it goes with everything. The new Starlight color is slightly off-white, making it look more subtle and unique in some ways. If you're looking to spice things up a notch, then we recommend this color, as it will stand out everywhere.\n\n(PRODUCT) RED\n\nApple played with the shade of its unique Red color in recent years, and we now have a more vibrant, pale Red color that stands out even more, although, some people will call back the iPhone 8's Red color as the best shade - including myself. If you want to show off, then the (PRODUCT) RED is the color you're looking for, as it's guaranteed to stand out in a crowd with its bright and bold shade.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Product Red iPhone contributes to the global fund that helps combat the COVID-19 virus.\n\nYellow\n\nOn March 7th, 2023, Apple unveiled the much anticipated Yellow version of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The new Yellow color joins the existing pale color palette, providing a fresh, bright, and colorful way to show off your new device. It's an excellent addition to the iPhone 14 lineup, and the lighter shade fits some of the best cases offered by Apple and many reputable third-party companies.\n\nApple iPhone 14\n\niPhone 14 joins the market as the smartphone to pick if you want a high-tier of performance, great cameras, and battery life that will last you through a day of use with ease.\n\nSee at Best Buy See at Verizon See at AT&T Apple iPhone 14 Plus\n\niPhone 14 Plus enters as the device to pick over iPhone 14 if you want the same high-tier performance and great cameras, with the added advantage of a screen that will help you see more at once and longer battery life.\n\nSee at Best Buy See at AT&T See at Verizon Best iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max colors Deep Purple\n\nDeep Purple is the cool new shade for the iPhone 14 Pro series in 2022 and looks beautiful. It has a dark shade of Purple, and its dark color makes it look smart, elegant, and unusually attractive. It's one of the most unique colors we've ever seen on an iPhone, and it goes with all clothes and accessories.\n\nGold\n\nThe Gold is now considered a classic color as it has been included in the iPhones for many years. This year's Pro series received an extra shiny shade of Yellow and Gold, making the device stand out even more. It's one of the most popular colors for the series, and the frame is extra glossy to catch even more eyeballs.\n\nSilver\n\nThe Silver color is also a classic, and it's been offered for iPhones for many, many years. It's one of the most popular colors, and while it's less showy than the Gold color, it's often preferred as it doesn't stand out as much, but it still stands out in crowds.\n\nSpace Black\n\nThe Space Black is perhaps the series's most common and popular color. You can't ever go wrong by picking this up; all cases will match perfectly with the dark glossy sides. It's the easiest color to go for and undoubtedly one of the most elegant and smart shades we've ever seen.\n\nWhich color of iPhone are you picking up next and why?

                    "body": "Apple announced a new iPhone this morning. No, not the iPhone 15 or the rumored iPhone 15 Ultra. Apple is refreshing the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus for 2023 with a brand new yellow color. Rumors of the yellow color began circulating a couple of weeks ago, and on Tuesday, March 7, Apple made it official.\n\nReading through the press release on its website, Apple says this new yellow hue adds \"even more color choices to the lineup.\" Per the company's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, Bob Borchers, \"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\"\n\nApple obviously wants you to be impressed with the new color. But is it actually any good? That's something you'll need to decide for yourself, but personally, I think it looks great. It looks very similar to the yellow color Apple uses on the iPad 10th Gen, which is to say it's a deep, saturated yellow. In keeping with the iPhone 14's typical design elements, the back glass provides a glossy yellow finish which contrasts nicely with the matte camera bump and aluminum frame. I still think the blue iPhone 14 is my personal favorite, but this may be a very close second.\n\nAs Apple fans may recall, this isn't the first time Apple's released a new color midway through an iPhone's life cycle. Last year, Apple released two new green finishes for the iPhone 13 family -- a standard \"green\" for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini plus \"alpine green\" for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 2\n\nInterestingly, Apple's only offering its new yellow color for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are still only available in the four launch colors of deep purple, gold, silver, and space black.\n\nIf you're interested in picking up the yellow iPhone 14 for yourself, pre-orders begin on Friday, March 10, with regular sales kicking off on Tuesday, March 14. Prices for the yellow iPhone 14 are the same as all other colors: $799 for the regular iPhone 14 and $899 for the iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nEditors' Recommendations iPhone 15: release date and price predictions, leaks, rumors, and more I tested the Galaxy S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 Pro cameras.

Apple has announced a new yellow colourway for its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus smartphones, bringing the total number of finish options to six.\n\nWhen the company initially announced the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in September 2022, they were offered in Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight and Product (RED). These colours remain, but they will be joined by Yellow, with pre-orders for the new colour option kicking off from 10 March.\n\nPOCKET-LINT VIDEO OF THE DAY Apple / Pocket-lint Apple iPhone 14\n\nThe Yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus has all the same design and specs as the other colour options, including a dual rear camera, A15 Bionic chip and features like Crash Detection and Action mode.\n\nPre-order the yellow iPhone 14 on Apple\n\nAll other features of the Yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus remain the same as the original offerings. You'll therefore find a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display on the iPhone 14 and a 6.7-inch display on the iPhone 14 Plus. Both models have a Ceramic Shield front cover over their displays and they both offer a notch at the top rather than the Dynamic Island cutout that you'll find on the iPhone Pro models. They also both feature a 1200nits peak brightness and support for Dolby Vision.\n\nUnder the hoods of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, you'll find the A15 Bionic chip with the same five-core GPU as the iPhone 13 Pro. There's a dual camera on the rear of both the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus, made up of a 12-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. A few extra features were introduced with the iPhone 14 models though, including a Photonic Engine and a feature called Action mode for smooth video even when you're moving yourself.\n\nOn the back of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, you'll find a glass panel with a glossy finish, while the camera housing in the top left rear corner offers a frosted matte finish. The frame meanwhile is finished in aluminium rather than stainless steel like the Apple iPhone 14 Pro models.\n\nThere are a number of other features on board the iPhone 14 models, including Emergency SOS and Car Crash detection and no matter what colour option you choose of the iPhone 14, you'll get all these features on board.\n\nAs mentioned, the Yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available to pre-order from 10 March, with availability starting 14 March. What do you think? Will it brighten up your day?",

This year, we have a vivid new yellow color, following the muted green of last year and the purple from the year before that.\n\nThe new model features an intensely bright yellow for the glass back panel, which looks somewhere between the pale yellow of the iPhone 11 and the deep yellow of the iPhone XR. The aluminum frame has the same bright yellow gold color as the iPhone 11 variant unlike the pale gold of the iPhone XR.\n\nUnlike last year, the new color will not be offered on the Pro models. Instead, it joins the existing five colors on the standard iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models, which currently includes midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, and purple.\n\nAside from the new color, there are no technical differences between this model and the rest.\n\nApple also announced four new colors for its range of silicone cases for all four iPhone 14 models. This includes Canary Yellow, Olive, Sky, and Iris. These retail at $49 each.\n\nCanary Yellow * Olive * Sky * Iris\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in yellow will be available to pre-order from March 10 at 5:00 AM PST. The new case colors are available to order today.",

Along with that, Apple also revealed that Emergency SOS via satellite feature is coming to six more countries.\n\nIn all of that noise you will be delighted to learn that Apple has revealed five new silicone case color options for both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro. The new colors are as follows:\n\nAre these the silicone case colors you've been waiting for? They are here and you can buy them right now for just $49 each. They are available through Apple's website or you can just walk into your nearby Apple Store and grab one, or all four, if you want to go wild.\n\nHere's a close look at the colors before you go ahead and buy them:\n\nCanary yellow is my personal favorite in all of this. And as ever, these colors look perfect on a silver or white iPhone 14. But, if you want to keep your purple theme going for the rest of the year, then the Iris color option is especially made for you.\n\nThere's always going to be someone out there who would recommend getting a third-party case because it's available in more color options and I get it, you're right. But, with the official case, you get a fit and finish you won't find anywhere else. Not to forget the MagSafe animation you see on the iPhone display when you put these cases on, signaling people around you that you spent good money to maintain your bragging rights.",

                    "body": "In 2022, the phone game was a total iPhone takeover, as eight out of the top 10 most-popular smartphones were from the Apple family, leaving only two spots for Android. It's no secret that Apple's iPhones have been a recurring presence in these rankings, dominating the charts year after year. But this time, with the iPhone 14 Pro Max leading the charge, they seem to have outdone themselves. Counterpoint Research, the unofficial referee of the smartphone arena, reported this trend, highlighting how Apple products conveniently managed to fill up eight of the 10 slots.\n\nAnd can you blame consumers for gravitating towards these luscious, sleek devices? The top three spots alone are hogged by the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro Max, and the now beloved iPhone 14 Pro Max. But let's not forget about the other iPhones that made the list - the iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Pro, all securing their places in the top 10. And for the budget-conscious buyers, the iPhone SE 2022 came in ninth, driving a hard bargain among more expensive models.\n\nIt's clear that Samsung is trailing behind in this race with only two of their phones managing to break into the top 10. The Galaxy A13 and Galaxy A03 came in fourth and tenth, respectively, but let's not forget that these were LTE models, not even 5G! It's a significant blow for Android OEMs looking to secure their spot on this prestigious list next year. It's a harsh reality that they'll have to face soon enough.\n\nBut the more pressing question here is that what in the world happened to the iPhone 14 Plus? Did it crash and burn, sending it plummeting to its doom? It seems that it's nowhere in the top 10, leaving many people scratching their heads. Did Apple miss the mark with this one, leaving customers unimpressed? Only time will tell.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple is showing no signs of slowing down in the smartphone space, constantly churning out fan-favorite iPhones year after year. As for Android, it's a dog-eat-dog world, and they're going to need to up their game if they want to stand a chance against the almighty Apple.",

Just a couple of weeks ahead of the start of spring, Apple has announced the new yellow color version for both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nThis is the first model in Apple's iOS smartphone series to get a yellow color option since the iPhone 11. It joins the previous Midnight, Starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, Blue, and Purple colors for those phones. Sadly, the yellow color won't be made available for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models. Pre-orders for the new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus begin on March 10, and they will officially go on sale on March 14.\n\nBesides the yellow iPhone 14, Apple also announced that the phone's Emergency SOS feature will be added later this March for residents of Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal. It's already available in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the U.K. It allows the phone to access satellites if Wi-Fi or cellular connections are not available so the owner can send messages to emergency services.",

                    "body": "Apple is welcoming back a yellow iPhone into the smartphone color spectrum fold. On Tuesday, Apple surprised no one by unveiling its new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, adding a bright color spectrum to our list of best smartphones.\n\nThe canary yellow frame is reminiscent of the yellow last seen on the iPhone 11 and even that iconic iPhone 5c. It's bold but not necessarily brash. It's also not coming to the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nAs I wrote in my reviews of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, these are a pair of excellent iOS devices that didn't move the bar on design. Both phones still have the notch instead of the new Dynamic Island. They're also running the previous generation A15 Bionic CPU. They're still excellent handsets with a solid 12MP dual camera array and the excellent 12MP TrueDepth camera on the front.\n\nPerhaps this new color, which joins midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED,9 blue, and purple as a color variation, is the extra spark the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus need to be just a little more inspiring.\n\nYou can pre-order a yellow iPhone starting Friday, March 10 at 9AM ET in the US, UK, and Australia. The iPhone 14 still starts at $799 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,339 (with 128GB of storage) and the iPhone 14 Plus runs for $899 / \u00a3949 / AU$1,579.\n\nPeople love choice and can be quite passionate about color, even when it comes to technology. For a time, Apple's Rose Gold-colored devices were the must-have device. The Rose Gold iPhone 6, which launched in 2016, was a sensation and a must-have device for fans of the slightly pink-ish iPhone.\n\nThere are not a lot of yellow gadgets unless you look at kid tech. And while we've known for a while that Apple was probably producing this, the rabid, fever-pitch interest is not necessary there.\n\nPlus, the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus do nothing different than the blue, purple, or midnight handsets. At least with Product(RED), you know that when you buy the phone Apple is also donating to charity.\n\nIn any case, it's just another option to help you match your iPhone 14 with your other, ahem, yellow accessories.",

The new yellow finish is a bright, almost banana, yellow - or so it seems from the press pictures. This really stands out among the other five colours, which, aside from the red, are pretty muted.\n\nThe colour is available for both the regular iPhone 14 and the larger iPhone 14 Plus. However, there is no new option for the iPhone 14 Pro or larger iPhone 14 Pro Max. The yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available to preorder from Friday 10th March from the Apple website and are priced identically to the other colours - that's starting from \u00a3849 / $799 for the 14 and \u00a3949 / $899 for the 14 Plus.\n\nIn addition to the new colour, there are four new silicon cases, finished in Olive (green), Sky (blue), Iris (purple) and Yellow. These are priced at the regular \u00a349 / $49.\n\nThe iPhone 14 is an impressive device, with a 6.1-inch display, which for many is an ideal size. While it doesn't offer the ProMotion display or Dynamic Island of the iPhone 14 Pro models, it does feature the Emergency SOS satellite service, crash detection and action mode video stabilisation.\n\nThe larger iPhone 14 Plus benefits from a larger 6.7-inch screen and a longer battery life of up to 26 hours video playback and 100 hours audio playback.",

The new model -- which doesn't add any additional enhancements -- becomes available for preorder on 10 March and will go on sale in retail stores in the US on 14 March, the company said.\n\nThe colour addition gives Apple a new way to market a product that went on sale about six months ago -- keeping it top of mind for consumers at a time when the iPhone 15 launch is still another six months away. Apple has used the tactic frequently in recent years.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, the company released red versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 lines, respectively. In 2021, it added a purple iPhone 12. Last year, it released green versions of both the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro.\n\nFor 2023, the company hasn't added a new iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max colour. Those models continue to come in black, gold, silver and purple.\n\nWith the next generation of iPhone, expected in September, Apple is planning to add the Dynamic Island -- the new interface at the top of the device -- to the lower-end versions. Though the standard iPhone 15 will retain the look of the previous model, the iPhone 15 Pro will get more significant changes, including a new titanium design, faster processor and periscope camera with much-improved zoom.\n\nAs it has done in the past, Apple has also added new colours for its iPhone cases and watch bands. In the coming months, the company is also planning new Macs -- including new MacBook Air models and the first Apple Silicon-based Mac Pro -- as well as the introduction of its first mixed-reality headset. -- (c) 2023 Bloomberg LP",

Read MobileSyrup's review on the iPhone 14 here and the iPhone 14 Plus here.\n\nApple will start taking pre-orders on March 10th at 5am PST. Canadians can also purchase the device when it becomes available on March 14th.",

                    "body": "The new Yellow won't be available for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nKeeping up with the tradition of launching new iPhone colour every spring, Apple on Tuesday released a new colour option for its iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, taken straight out of a bright colour palette. Giving the existing colour options a dazzling touch, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be available in yellow shade.\n\nWith this new addition, buyers can choose from Midnight, Starlight, [Product] Red, Blue, Purple and the new Yellow. As seen in the other iPhone 14 models, the Yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have a glossy back and a matte finish frame, which complement well together.\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \"The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.\"\n\nPricing and availability\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in the new Yellow will be available alongside other colour options in 128GB, 256GB and 512GB storage options. They start at Rs 79,900 and Rs 89,900, respectively. If you opt for 256GB or 512GB storage, the iPhone 14 will set you back for Rs 89,900 and Rs 1,09,900, respectively, and the iPhone 14 Plus will cost Rs 99,900 and Rs 1,19,900. There are no changes in the pricing for the new yellow colour.\n\nAs for availability, the new yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be available for pre-order from March 10, and on sale from March 14.\n\nA spring dash\n\nApple started the tradition of launching a new iPhone colour every spring for a few years now. This move helps propel sales after a holiday rush. Last year, Apple chose to offer a new colour to its Pro-series by launching \"alpine green\" iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro. Prior to that, Apple revealed a \"brilliant purple\" iPhone 12 and 12 mini.\n\nThis year, Apple also launched iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus Silicone Cases, which will be available in four new colours: canary yellow, olive, sky, and iris.\n\nWhat's different in new Yellow?\n\nExcept for the new colour variant, the yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus share the same specs. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus were launched in September last year, alongside iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. The 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus feature aerospace-grade aluminium design that is water- and dust-resistant, further protected by Ceramic Shield front cover. Both phones have the Super Retina XDR OLED display with 1200 nits of peak HDR brightness and Dolby Vision.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have a dual rear-camera setup and a new front TrueDepth camera. The main 12MP sensor is larger with f/1.5 aperture, and 1.9 \u00b5m pixels and sensor-shift optical image stabilisation, which is paired with an Ultra-Wide camera. The TrueDepth camera has an f/1.9 aperture sensor and autofocus. With the 14-series, users get Photonic Engine, which improves mid- to low-light performance for photos across all cameras compared to the previous generation. Video features like Action mode and Cinematic mode are also available for users to test their creativity.\n\nUnder the hood, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are powered by A15 Bionic with 5-core and iOS 16. The iPhones also get new safety features, Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite.",

                    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is returning to a frequent trick it uses to keep buyers interested in its current iPhone line until the new model arrives: adding a new color.\n\nThe company announced a yellow version of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus on Tuesday, adding to the existing midnight, blue, purple, red and starlight options. The new model -- which doesn't add any additional enhancements -- becomes available for preorder on March 10 and will go on sale in retail stores on March 14, the company said.\n\nThe color addition gives Apple a new way to market a product that went on sale about six months ago -- keeping it top-of-mind for consumers at a time when the iPhone 15 launch is still another six months away. Apple has used the tactic frequently in recent years.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, the company released red versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 lines, respectively. In 2021, it added a purple iPhone 12. Last year, it released green versions of both the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro.\n\nFor 2023, the company hasn't added a new iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max color. Those models continues to come in black, gold, silver and purple.\n\nWith the next generation of iPhone, expected in September, Apple is planning to add the Dynamic Island -- the new interface at the top of the device -- to the lower-end versions. Though the standard iPhone 15 will retain the look of the previous model, the iPhone 15 Pro will get more significant changes, including a new titanium design, faster processor and periscope camera with much-improved zoom.\n\nAs it has done in the past, Apple has also added new colors for its iPhone cases and watch bands. In the coming months, the company is also planning new Macs -- including new MacBook Air models and the first Apple Silicon-based Mac Pro -- as well as the introduction of its first mixed-reality headset.",

The new color was first rumored to launch last week and has now been made official.\n\nThe new shade adds to the existing Midnight, Starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, Blue, and Purple options. Apple usually introduces new color options in the spring to boost sales midway through the device's product cycle. Last year, the company introduced a new Green color for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini and a new Alpine Green color for the iPhone 13 Pro models.\n\nThe new color iPhones offer the same features as the regular iPhone 14 models. Both models come with a dual-camera system, a powerful A15 Bionic chip, and safety capabilities such as Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection. The devices also have a durable Ceramic Shield front cover and an updated internal design for better-sustained performance and easier repairs.\n\nIn addition to the new color, Apple has also announced four new Silicone Case colors for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, including Canary Yellow, Olive, Sky, and Iris. The new colors add to the existing lineup, which includes colors such as Pink, White, and Black.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in Yellow will be available for pre-order on Friday, March 10, with availability starting on Tuesday, March 14.",

You can get your hands on a unit as soon as next week!\n\nReaders like you help support XDA Developers. When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More.\n\nWe recently read rumors about Apple potentially launching a new color option for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. Well, the wait is finally over. In a newsroom post, the company announced earlier today that customer can pre-order the non-Pro iPhone 14 models in a brand-new Yellow color starting this Friday. Units will then start shipping to customer and other retail stores next week, on March 14. Expectedly, the new Yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models cost the same as other finishes, starting at $799 and $899 respectively.\n\nXDA VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\nIt's not unusual for Apple to reveal a new iPhone color around spring. Last year, for example, the company launched a Green iPhone 13 in early March. Similarly, we got our hands on a Purple iPhone 12 back in April 2021.\n\nOf course, apart from the color-specific wallpapers, the new Yellow iPhone 14 models pack no additional features or perks. They're just an extra color options for those unhappy with the five existing finishes. And alongside that, customers can also buy Apple Silicone Cases in new Canary Yellow, Olive, Sky, and Iris colors.\n\nTo get your hands on the new iPhone color, you can head to the Apple Online Store starting March 10. Alternatively, you can visit the nearest physical Apple Store and buy a unit starting next Tuesday.\n\nApple iPhone 14\n\nThe iPhone 14 is the base model of the 2022 iPhone series, offering a balanced set of features for the average user.\n\n$799 at Best Buy $799 at Apple $799 at AT&T Apple iPhone 14 Plus\n\nThe iPhone 14 Plus comes with a larger 6.7-inch screen but misses out on the Dynamic Island and Always-On Display feature.\n\n$899 at AT&T $899 at Apple $899 at Best Buy\n\nSource: Apple",

                    "body": "Long gone are the days when the iPhone only came in two colors. Nowadays, Apple has forsaken this white and black ideology (pun intended) and has embraced color in all its glory, with many of the company's devices now coming in a plethora of bold shades.\n\nThe latest addition to Apple's iPhone rainbow is a yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. Today, the Cupertino company announced the imminent launch of this new shade via a blog post on its official Apple Newsroom website.\n\nThe rather bold color option is bound to make the device stand out in a crowded room. With the addition of this new shade, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus now come in a total of 6 colors: midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, purple and yellow.\n\nFor reference, Apple has developed a penchant for releasing exclusive color options in the middle of an iPhone's refresh cycle. Given that the iPhone 14 lineup launched in early September, this mid-cycle shade comes right in time.\n\nAccording to the blog post, the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available in more than 60 countries, with pre-orders opening at 5 a.m. PST this Friday (i.e. March 10th). General availability begins shortly afterwards - on Tuesday, March 14th.\n\nIt should be noted that, traditionally, Apple has also released exclusive color options for its high-end iPhone Pro models as well. Nevertheless, we do not know if and when a new shade for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max will be launching.\n\nIn light of the fact that the Pro models tend to feature a more muted aesthetic, it will be interesting to see what color Apple could opt for this time around. Last year's Deep Purple iPhone proved to be wildly successful, being by far the most popular color option out of the bunch.",

                    "body": "The rumours were spot on! Apple today launched the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in all-new \"yellow\" colour giving potential buyers a fifth option to choose from, as part of what's now becoming an annual tradition of spring refreshes for Cupertino. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in yellow will be available to pre-order from March 10 in more than 60 countries -- India included -- from March 10. You will be able to buy them in stores and online from March 14.\n\nThe yellow refresh joins the existing lineup of midnight, purple, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, and blue flavours. Core specs and pricing remains unchanged, naturally. The iPhone 14 price in India starts at Rs 79,900 for a version with 128GB of storage. The iPhone 14 Plus will set you back by Rs 89,900 for the same amount of base storage. The iPhone 14 is a follow-up to the iPhone 13 with a 6.1-inch OLED screen, dual 12MP cameras, and A15 Bionic chip. The iPhone 14 Plus is essentially the same phone with a bigger 6.7-inch display.\n\nAlso Read | iPhone 14 Pro: The best iPhone of 2022 is a sneak-peek into the future (of iPhone)\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing said in a prepared statement, adding that \"the extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.\"\n\nLast year, Apple had separately launched the iPhone 13 series in green with the pro models also getting an upgrade, alongside. That doesn't seem to be the case this year as only the non-pro iPhones are getting updated. Apple has made yellow iPhones before. The iPhone 5c, iPhone 11 and iPhone XR, all came in yellow. So, it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, really. New colour rollouts help continue hype and boost sales mid-cycle before the arrival of the next wave of iPhones. Joining the yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be a bunch of new silicone cases to go along in canary yellow, olive, sky, and iris.",

                    "body": "The rumors were true. Apple has announced a new color for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus and it's indeed yellow.\n\nApple says that it wanted to bring more color choices to its lineup this spring and the new hue looks like a pretty bold canary yellow to us. The new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available for pre-order March 10 and the release date is March 14.\n\nThe iPhone 14 color options now include midnight, starlight, red, blue, purple and yellow.\n\nEverything else about the iPhone 14 remains the same, which is good because it's among the best phones you can buy right now. You get an improved dual-camera system with better low-light performance, a faster A15 Bionic chip and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite.\n\nJust like the other iPhone 14 models, Apple touts that the 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus sport a durable aluminum design that's water- and dust-resistant with a durable Ceramic Shiled front cover that protects from drops. Plus, there's an updated internal design that's designed to deliver better sustained performance.\n\nWhile both iPhone 14 models boast up to 1,200 nits of peak brightness with HDR content, the refresh rate is only 60Hz while other flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy S23 go up to 120Hz.\n\nOther highlights include a larger sensor for the main camera and an ultra-wide camera, but you don't get a telephoto zoom unlike other flagships. For that, you need to step up to the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. The front TrueDepth camera is improved with auto-focus and a larger aperture for better low-light performance.\n\nIn our iPhone 14 review we liked the excellent camera performance, vibrant display and fast A15 Bionic performance, plus the smooth Action mode video that really stabilizes your footage when you're in motion along with your subject.\n\nIf you want a big screen for a good price, our iPhone 14 Plus review shows that this $899 phone is a pretty good value, and it offers exceptional battery life compared to the iPhone 14. In our iPhone 14 battery life testing we saw nearly 12 hours of runtime form the iPhone 14 Plus and the regular iPhone 14 endured for 9:28.\n\nSo should you buy the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in yellow? It looks pretty attractive if you're the type of person who likes to stand out in a crowd. Just remember that you'll likely wind up covering up the design with one of the best iPhone 14 cases.",

                    "body": "New iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus handsets join the line up: now in yellow.\n\nSpring may be a couple of weeks away, but Apple is already set for the sunshine and warmer weather. As rumored over the past several days, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus has indeed launched.\n\nThe new yellow color joins the existing midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, and purple colors in the lineup. Nothing else about the phone has changed and there's no yellow Pro version. The last time Apple sold a yellow iPhone was the iPhone 11, which followed the iPhone XR and iPhone 5c.\n\nIn our review of the iPhone 14, we described it as \"good enough,\" with good speed and a nice camera. While it doesn't have the Dynamic Island or the always-on display of the more expensive iPhone 14 Pro, it brings enough new features to make it an excellent choice if you are looking to upgrade from an older iPhone. As for the iPhone 14 Plus, it's a bigger version of the iPhone 14 (6.7 inches versus 6.1 inches), so you get a bigger screen and better battery life. If those two features matter to you then it's a good choice.\n\nWe aren't sure that the new color is a reason to rush out to buy a new iPhone, but it does give Apple a chance to grab some headlines with a new iPhone launch as it's done with previous mid-cycle iPhone releases: in March 2017 Apple introduced a (Product) Red version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; in April 2021, Apple launched a purple iPhone 12 and 12 mini; and a green iPhone 13 and Alpine Green iPhone 13 Pro joined the iPhone 13 line up in March 2022.\n\nWill yellow be a popular choice? Maybe not, according to a CIRP study, most iPhone customers choose more muted shades. \"For most models, the predominant color was black (or should we say midnight or graphite or space gray), followed by a shade of blue or white,\" the report indicates. However, the study does suggest that the reintroduction of purple in 2022 proved popular.\n\nThe new yellow version of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be available for preorder on Friday, March 10, with availability beginning Tuesday, March 14.",

                    "body": "Introducing the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus - it's yellow and it's fabulous! This latest offering from the tech giant, Apple, boasts an impressive set of features that truly make it stand out from the crowd. And it's not just in its color, though we have to say it does bring a certain je ne sais quoi to the table. But, we digress. Let's talk about what really matters - the battery life is incredible, the dual-camera system is pro-level for those Instagram-worthy photos and videos, plus it comes with some groundbreaking safety features that even your great grandma would approve of.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The internal design has been updated for better performance and easier repairs. It's also water- and dust-resistant, with super durable aerospace-grade aluminum, and a Ceramic Shield front cover that's tougher than any other smartphone glass. The display boasts OLED technology, supports 1200 nits of peak HDR brightness, and for those who prefer a larger display, the iPhone 14 Plus has got you covered with the longest battery life of any iPhone ever.\n\nNow, let's talk about the camera system. With the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, you'll have access to an advanced dual-camera system that features a new pro-level Main camera with a larger sensor for stunning photos and videos. It also includes an Ultra Wide camera for unique perspectives and a front TrueDepth camera that automatically focuses on multiple subjects at different distances for sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. And let's not forget about the Photonic Engine, which can improve mid- to low-light performance for photos across all cameras compared to the previous generation.\n\nLastly, Apple has really outdone themselves with the safety features for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. Emergency SOS via satellite allows users to message with emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, and there's even Crash Detection which can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone. Plus, the A15 Bionic chip with 5-core GPU delivers extraordinary battery life and handles intensive tasks with ease.\n\nAll in all, we think the new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus is a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone. Coming in at an affordable price point with so many amazing features, it's a no-brainer. So, what are you waiting for? Pre-order yours this Friday, March 10, and be the envy of all your friends.",

                    "body": "Apple has just announced two new iPhone 14 variants, the yellow versions of iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, though not for the iPhone 14 Pro. And there was an announcement which hadn't quite been predicted in the leaks and rumors: four new silicone case colors.\n\nAs is usually the case when Apple makes these announcements, the phones are identical to what's in the range now, just in a new color.\n\nIt's not a bad thing: if you've been waiting for your service contract to expire, so you weren't able to upgrade to the iPhone 14 series last September, you can still be front of the line for a brand new iPhone. Oh yes, you might say to anyone who will listen, I got one of the very first iPhone 14 Plus yellow models.\n\nAnd the yellow looks just great: bright and glossy on the iPhone's back, more demure and restrained on the aluminum edge band. Both seem entirely appropriate for a Spring season release.\n\nThis being Apple, every detail has been perfectly color-matched right down to the inside of the Lightning charging socket. Now, that's attention to detail. The thing is, when Apple comes up with a new shade, it has several colors to think of. Not just the glass back and the aluminum band, as mentioned. No, you'll notice that the camera panel is another yellow, because instead of being shiny, it has a matte finish where it surrounds the dual cameras and flash. Plus, of course, the Apple logo isn't silver, but silver that's color-coordinated with elements of yellow.\n\nThe rear of the iPhone 14 Pro takes the reverse plan: the main back is matte, the camera panel glossy. But, sadly, there's no Pro colorway added today, perhaps because the gold finish Pro is somewhat similar to the matte finish of the gold. Plus, the Pro phones tend to lean to quieter colors and even in matte, the yellow is quite punchy.\n\nIt brings the total number of colors to choose from in the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus to six: midnight, starlight (PRODUCT)RED, blue, purple and the new yellow.\n\nIf I were choosing an iPhone now, yellow would definitely be my first choice. It's the perfect balance of vibrant and smart, enough sunshine and not too much lemon.\n\nThere are four brand new iPhone 14 silicone case colors: canary yellow, olive, sky, and iris.\n\nApple wasn't the first phone company to focus on the importance of color, but it continues to lead the field with a balance of quantity and quality.\n\nThe new yellow iPhones are available to order now, and available from Friday, March 14. The price is the same as for the other models, that is, from $799 for the iPhone 14 and from $899 for the iPhone 14 Plus.",

Apple warns that foliage or other obstructions can result in messages taking longer to send or failing to send, and satellite connectivity might not work in places above 62\u00b0 latitude. The service is free for two years after activating an iPhone 14.\n\nEmergency SOS via Satellite first launched in November in the U.S. and Canada and requires an iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, or iPhone 14 Pro Max. The service became available in France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK in December.",

But it is not conclusive, either way.\n\nThe leak comes from Twitter user \"fix Apple,\" who claims to be a hardware technician \"at Apple and Huwai,\" and rarely tweets, This image is described solely as being the \"new one,\" and could be a side view of the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, or a combination of models.\n\nEach of the four iPhones shown features a section for the volume control, but with the button or buttons absent. There is just a section indented into the chassis, which features a pair of contact points.\n\nIt's not possible to be sure whether this means a single button that stretches over the two points. However, it is a single indent, where previously the iPhone chassis had separate cutaways for the two volume controls.\n\nBeyond what appears to be a new volume rocker, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to be yet another iteration of the existing design, though the slight change could be striking. The bottom edge of the metal frame is rumored to curve into the glass back for a more uniform, smooth design.\n\nThe metal material would be made of titanium instead of stainless steel. The glass back will remain the same to enable wireless charging and MagSafe.\n\nThe camera bump could change to accommodate the rumored periscope telephoto camera -- more on that later. Despite having a new camera system, the camera bump could shrink slightly in length and width, though is still expected to be thicker overall.",

Apple has a new yellow color for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. It is going to be available starting next week, on March 14.\n\nNow, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in midnight starlight (PRODUCT)RED, blue, purple and yellow. It has the same starting price of $799 for the 128GB model. And it goes up from there.\n\nApple is also announcing new colors for the silicon cases for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. That includes canary yellow, olive, sky and iris. So there's plenty of options for the silicon cases now.\n\nThere's nothing new with this iPhone, other than the fact that it is now in yellow. So if you already have the iPhone 14 or 14 Plus in one of the other colors, there's no real reason to run out and grab this yellow one. Unless, you really want the yellow color.\n\nThis yellow color is actually really nice. It's a pretty bright color, almost highlighter like. Which is definitely an interesting color for the iPhone.\n\nApple typically does this around the Spring, typically in March. Where they will launch a new color for the iPhone, as well as a few more colors of its silicon cases, leather cases and Apple Watch cases. In the past, we've had green and purple. And now yellow, giving us some really cool spring colors.\n\nLast year, Apple did launch the green iPhone in the Pro models. But this year, it appears to only be happening for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. There's no new color for the Pro models, at least not yet. There's a rumor that we are expecting more Apple releases this week, so we could see this come later this week, but it's unlikely.",

                    "body": "Apple launched a new colour variant for iPhone 13 series a year ago\n\nApple launched the iPhone 14 series in September last year and has now announced the availability of iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models in a new colour variant. Both models are now available in yellow, joining the five original colours. The company did not introduce any other updates or modifications to the iPhone 14 lineup. The high-end iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max devices have not been updated with any new colour variants either. Apple introduced new colour variants to the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro series a year ago, and the year before that it added a new colour option to the iPhone 12 lineup. There were also multiple reports about Apple launching this new colour for the iPhone 14 non-Pro models.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models were previously offered in five colour options -- Blue, Midnight, Purple, Starlight, and (Product) RED, and are now also available in Yellow. The phones are available in three storage configurations -- 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. In India, the base iPhone 14 starts at Rs. 79,900, while the iPhone 14 Plus starts at Rs. 89,900.\n\nThe iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, while the iPhone 14 Plus flaunts a 6.7-inch display. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are, however, both powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chipset and run iOS 16 out-of-the-box.\n\nFor optics, both models sport dual rear camera units including a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera with a 1.9um sensor and an f/1.7 aperture lens. The phones also have a 12-megapixel sensor paired with an ultra-wide-angle lens with an f/2.4 aperture and a 120-degree field of view. According to Apple, the front selfie camera on these models is a 12-megapixel TrueDepth camera with an f/1.9 aperture lens.\n\nThe handsets also feature improved video recording capabilities than their predecessors and include a stabilisation feature called Action Mode, according to the company. This mode improves video correction by utilising the phone's motion sensors. The Cinematic mode is now available in 4K at 30 frames per second and 4K at 24 frames per second. Apple also emphasises the improved low-light performance provided by the new Photonic Engine.\n\nIt is claimed that the ultra-wide camera's low-light performance has gotten better by up to 2x, the TrueDepth front camera's by 2x, and the main camera's by 2.5x. Apple also claims that the True Tone flash has been improved and is now 10 percent brighter.\n\nApple does not officially confirm the battery specifications of the devices but claims that the base model has a video playback time of up to 20 hours and the Plus model has a video playback time of up to 26 hours.",

                    "body": "Apple has announced the release of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in Yellow.\n\nA beautiful yellow joins the lineup, with incredible battery life, a powerful dual-camera system for pro-level photos and videos, and groundbreaking safety capabilities, including Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection.\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \"The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.\"\n\nApple also highlighted some features of the iPhone 14...\n\nA Beautiful and Durable Design with Amazing Battery Life\n\nThe 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus feature a durable aerospace-grade aluminum design that is water- and dust-resistant, with a Ceramic Shield front cover that is tougher than any other smartphone glass, protecting iPhone from common spills and accidents. An updated internal design provides better sustained performance -- great for heavy workloads and high-powered gaming -- while improving ease and affordability of repairs. Both models include a gorgeous Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology that supports 1200 nits of peak HDR brightness, along with support for Dolby Vision. The larger display of iPhone 14 Plus is fantastic for watching content, streaming Apple Fitness+ workouts, and playing games, while boasting the longest battery life of any iPhone ever.\n\nA Powerful Dual-Camera System to Capture Every Moment\n\nWith iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, users have an advanced dual-camera system right in their pockets. The system features an impressive new pro-level Main camera with a larger sensor for gorgeous photos and videos, as well as an Ultra Wide camera to capture unique perspectives. Both iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus include the new front TrueDepth camera that automatically focuses on multiple subjects at different distances for sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. And the larger aperture captures brighter color and finer detail in low-light scenes.\n\nThe iPhone 14 lineup introduced Photonic Engine, improving mid- to low-light performance for photos across all cameras compared to the previous generation: up to 2x on the TrueDepth and Ultra Wide cameras, and 2.5x on the new Main camera. Photonic Engine is able to preserve subtle textures, provide better color, and maintain more information in a photo through a deep integration of hardware and software.\n\nVideo features like Action mode and Cinematic mode are available across the iPhone 14 lineup to help users unleash their creativity. Action mode enables smooth-looking video that adjusts to significant shakes and motion -- even when video is being captured in the middle of the action. Cinematic mode supports 4K at 30 fps and 4K at 24 fps, enabling a beautiful depth-of-field effect that automatically changes focus in a simple and intuitive way to capture cinema-style moments.\n\nGroundbreaking Safety Capabilities for Peace of Mind\n\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus offer critical safety capabilities that can provide emergency assistance when it matters most. Emergency SOS via satellite allows users to message with emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available through a combination of custom-designed components and deeply integrated software. Additionally, if users want to reassure friends and family of their whereabouts while off the grid, they can open the Find My app and share their location via satellite. This service -- which has already helped users in emergency situations in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the U.K. -- will come to Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal later this month.\n\nCrash Detection on the iPhone 14 lineup can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone. Apple-designed motion algorithms trained with over a million hours of real-world driving and crash record data combine with motion inputs from the new accelerometer and gyroscope, GPS, barometer, and microphone5 on iPhone to bring this innovative safety feature to life. When paired with Apple Watch, Crash Detection seamlessly leverages the unique strength of both devices to get users help efficiently.\n\nPowered by A15 Bionic with 5-core GPU\n\nA15 Bionic brings powerful, pro-level performance to iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The 5-core GPU enables faster speeds for demanding workloads and even smoother graphics for video apps and high-performance gaming. A15 Bionic also powers camera features like Photonic Engine, Action mode, and Cinematic mode -- all while delivering extraordinary battery life and protecting critical privacy and security features like data encryption using the Secure Enclave. The 6-core CPU with two performance and four efficiency cores handles intensive tasks with ease, and the 16-core Neural Engine is capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features in iOS 16 and third-party app experiences.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\n\u25cf iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are currently available in midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED,9 blue, and purple, and will be available in yellow in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities, starting at $799 (US) and $899 (US) respectively.\n\n\u25cf Customers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., the U.S., and more than 60 other countries and regions will be able to pre-order iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in yellow beginning at 5 a.m. PST this Friday, March 10, with availability beginning Tuesday, March 14.\n\n\u25cf Customers in the U.S. can get iPhone 14 for $799 or $33.29 a month for 24 months before trade-in, and iPhone 14 Plus for $899 or $37.45 a month for 24 months before trade-in from apple.com/store, in the Apple Store app, and at Apple Store locations. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are also available through Apple Authorized Resellers and select carriers.\n\n\u25cf Apple offers great ways to save and upgrade to the latest iPhone.

All four iPhone 15 smartphones in the line-up are expected to come with bezels that will be slightly curved around the edges, like the ones we saw in the iPhone 11 series.\n\nGoing by the leaked videos, the Dynamic Island will likely be added to all four iPhone 15 models, which is currently limited to only iPhone 14 Pro models. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 15 series in September this year.\n\nEarlier, it was rumoured that the iPhone maker will bring support for Wi-Fi 6E network to only iPhone 15 Pro models. It was also reported that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will include new features such as solid-state buttons with haptic feedback, a titanium frame and increased RAM. It is also being reported that the iPhone 15 Pro Max will flaunt a thicker body and no real solid buttons.\n\nMeanwhile, separate reports suggest that Apple will be using OLED panels from Chinese display supplier BOE in its upcoming fourth-generation iPhone SE variants.\n\nLast month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had said that the tech giant has restarted development of the iPhone SE 4 smartphone, which will feature a 6.1-inch OLED display and an in-house 5G baseband chip.",

If you follow Apple closely, you know that the old rainbow Apple logo was made up of six colors. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nWhile the new finish is exciting, the yellow iPhone 14 is identical to the one that launched in September. It runs iOS 16, has an A15 Bionic chip, Emergency SOS via Satellite, Car Crash Detection and similar cameras as the iPhone 13 Pro (aside from the telephoto). In fact, we are halfway through the iPhone's annual upgrade cycle with the rumored iPhone 15 expected to launch in September.\n\nUnlike last year's iPhone 13 color drop, Apple did not announce a new version of the iPhone SE. In fact there are rumors that the SE is dead and others that say a new version of Apple's cheapest phone might still be on the way in 2024.\n\nThe new yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be available to preorder Friday. Most people are likely to put a case on their iPhone 14 no matter which color the phone is. If that's you, hopefully you'll pick one that lets the yellow shine through.",

It may not display this or other websites correctly.\n\nYou should upgrade or use an alternative browser.\n\nAn alleged real-world image of the right side of an iPhone 15 model's chassis has today been shared online, showing a cutout for the Side button and a black or \"Midnight\" finish.\n\nThe image, shared by Twitter user @lipilipsi, purportedly shows several chassis for one of the iPhone 15 models. The cutout for the Side button matches renders of the iPhone 15 Pro, which is expected to move to solid-state buttons with haptic feedback, but this is the first time it has been seen in real-world images.\n\nIt is unclear whether the image shows a standard iPhone 15 or an iPhone 15 Pro model. The chassis seems to be anodized in a black or \"Midnight\" color with a matte finish, which would indicate a standard iPhone 15 model, in contrast to the iPhone 15 Pro's brushed titanium finish. On the other hand, only this year's \"Pro\" models are expected to get solid-state buttons.\n\nIt is likely the case that the image does actually show a standard iPhone 15 model, and the cutout is actually designed for a mechanical button, since the two standard iPhone models are not expected to get haptic buttons this year.\n\nArticle Link: Alleged Real-World iPhone 15 Chassis Image Shows Black Finish and Side Button Cutout",

                    "body": "The Samsung Galaxy A03 came in the tenth spot Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max came in a close second The iPhone 14 series was unveiled in September last year\n\n2022 has been a remarkable year for Apple, according to a new report by a market research firm. The Cupertino-based tech giant continued to enjoy the lead in worldwide smartphone shipments with eight of its models featuring in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones. Launched in 2021, the iPhone 13 emerged as the best-selling model, followed by the iPhone 13 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max at second and third positions respectively. The list also includes iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone SE (2022). Samsung was represented in the top-10 list two entry-level Galaxy A series smartphones.\n\nMarket research firm Counterpoint Research in its latest Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker report has listed the iPhone 13 as the best-selling phone of 2022. Launched in 2021, the smartphone powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chip contributed to 28 percent of iPhone sales. The surge in demand for the old iPhone 13 series model is attributed to the price cuts post the launch of the iPhone 14 series in September last year. It was the best-selling smartphone in China, France, Germany, the US, and the UK.\n\nWhile iPhone 13 Pro Max took the second spot, the new iPhone 14 Pro Max came in third place. Counterpoint noted that the Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models in 2022. Samsung's budget offering Galaxy A13 occupied the fourth spot with the iPhone 13 Pro coming in a close fifth position.\n\nThe iPhone 12 took the sixth spot, followed by the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro at seventh and eighth positions respectively. Apple's budget offering, the iPhone SE (2022), grabbed the ninth position, while Samsung's Galaxy A03 rounds off the top-ten list. Popularity across the Caribbean and Latin America (CALA) and India drove the sale of the entry-level device. However, with the latest report, Apple has become the first brand to capture eight spots in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones.\n\nCounterpoint expects that the share of the top 10 smartphones will increase in 2023 as brands focus on clearing inventory and optimising their launches. Brands are expected to make their portfolios leaner this year to minimise cannibalisation, according to the research firm.",

                    "body": "One of the highlights of last year's iPhone 14 lineup was the implementation of Always-On Display functionality to the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. While the feature has been present on a wide range of Android devices for the better part of a decade, this is the first time Apple has dabbled with it.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple's take on the Always-On Display ostensibly relies on its ProMotion technology (i.e. the adaptive 1-120Hz refresh rate), which is only present on the Cupertino company's most high-end devices. Now, it seems, next year's vanilla iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will lack both of the aforementioned features.\n\nAccording to a leak first brought forward in a blog post, and subsequently covered by MacRumors in a dedicated article, the non-Pro iPhone 15 models will be receiving neither Always-On Display functionality, nor ProMotion.\n\nThis means that, in all likelihood, the lower-end variants will be stuck with a 60Hz panel, quite possibly making them the most expensive smartphones with such low refresh rate. Even entry-level smartphones from competitors often bump the refresh rate up to 90Hz.\n\nIn light of this decision, it seems Apple is doing little to boost the appeal of its non-Pro iPhones, despite the lackluster commercial performance of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. It seems Apple is opting for a different route - making the Pro models more premium and even more expensive.\n\nWhile this approach is not particularly customer friendly, the strategy seems to be working wonders. In fact, according to most rumors, Apple is even considering a top-of-the-line iPhone 15 Ultra that could end up being one of the most expensive non-foldable smartphones of all time.\n\nHowever, it should be noted 2023's best iPhone is not necessarily the most expensive one. Regardless of what Apple tries to sell you - you simply do not have to splurge $1000+ on a smartphone, unless you absolutely want to.",

                    "title": "Apple to team up with China's BOE for iPhone SE 4's 6.1-inch OLED panel: report",
                    "body": "Unlike its predecessors, the long-rumoured iPhone SE 4 is expected to sport an OLED panel, while Samsung and LG could focus more on LTPO models.\n\nAside from working on its next-gen iPhone 15 series, Apple is reportedly prepping to take the wraps off the iPhone SE 4 next year. As expected, the purported iPhone SE 3 successor has been floating around the rumour mill for quite some time now.\n\nAlso, many iPhone SE 4 leaks have been popping up on the web lately. Reliable analysts claim the next iPhone SE will feature an OLED panel with a notch for the front shooter. A new report from The Elec suggests China's BOE will supply the OLED panel for the iPhone SE 4.\n\nAs a result, Samsung could lose some business opportunities from the Cupertino-based tech giant next year. Nevertheless, this will enable Apple to cut costs by offering the next-gen iPhone SE with a more pocket-friendly OLED panel than the one it is reportedly planning to use with the iPhone 15 series.\n\nThe report adds the next SE series iPhone will sport a 6.1-inch OLED panel, which will be made by BOE. It is worth mentioning that the OLED panel supplied by BOE will cost around $40. The OLED panels supplied by Samsung Display and LG Display cost around $100.\n\nApple could use the Samsung Display and LG Display-supplied OLED panels for the iPhone 15 series and the OLED iPad models. This will help the American tech firm to keep the pricing of the iPhone SE 4 in check. BOE reportedly missed the first shipment of the iPhone 15 OLED. Nevertheless, it will supply OLED panels for the low-end iPhone SE 4.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Apple makes 19 per cent of its annual sales in China. So, the company will probably choose BOE as the main supplier for the iPhone SE 4 OLED panels since it has to consider the interest of the Chinese government as well. BOE will reportedly supply 6.1-inch OLED for the 4th generation of iPhone SE.\n\nInterestingly, the iPhone SE series has featured only LCD (liquid crystal display). So, the iPhone SE 4 will be the first SE model to come with an OLED panel. The iPhone SE lineup targets those new to the iPhone and is usually launched in emerging markets like India.\n\nBy the time the iPhone SE 4 goes official next year, Samsung Display will have eight production models, which include four upcoming iPhone 15 series models. Likewise, LG Display would prefer to focus more on LTPO models for higher-end devices since it has a smaller production capacity than Samsung Display.\n\nAccording to some reports, OLED shipments for the 4th-gen iPhone SE could be around 20 million units in 2024. BOE is reportedly working on the OLED panels for the Plus models but is facing challenges in making Dynamic Islands on the displays. Samsung Display and LG Display are expected to start mass production of the iPhone 15 OLED panel's first batch in June.\n\nMoreover, the report suggests that BOE will also make iPhone 15 OLED, but it will be for the refurbished (repaired) models rather than the new ones. According to a report by 91mobiles, the iPhone SE 4 could retain the body, specifications, and some components of the iPhone 14. This is a major sign that the iPhone SE 4 will have an OLED panel.\n\nSome reports indicate the iPhone SE 4 will feature a 6.1-inch LTPO panel that supports a standard 60Hz refresh rate. On the other hand, the iPhone 15 series models could get the ProMotion Display with a refresh rate of 120Hz.",

                    "body": "Apple is keeping up its recent tradition of adding new iPhone colors in the spring. The company has introduced yellow versions of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus -- sorry, no Pro equivalent this year. They're identical in functionality and price to other hues, of course ($799 and $899 respectively), but don't be surprised if you start humming tunes about yellow submarines or bananaphones.\n\nCustomers in over 60 countries (including the US, UK and Canada) can pre-order the yellow iPhone 14 family starting on March 10th at 8AM Eastern. The new versions will be available on March 14th alongside new silicone case colors that include a canary yellow.\n\nThis certainly isn't the first time Apple has offered the iPhone in this color. The iPhone 5c had a particularly bright yellow option, and you could buy the iPhone 11 in a paler shade. However, the modern iPhone design hasn't been available in that color at all until now -- you've had to be content with mostly subdued tones outside of Product Red models.\n\nThe strategy behind this isn't surprising. A new color theoretically boosts iPhone sales in the middle of the product cycle. It also gives the company an excuse to update Apple Watch bands for the spring. Still, you might not mind if you're in the market for a phone and want something livelier than the monochromatic options that define the landscape.",

The company also unveiled new silicon cases for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus: canary yellow, olive, sky, and iris.\n\nSurprisingly, there's no new shade for the Pro this year, with just the regular iPhone getting a fresh coat of paint.\n\nApple unveiled its best iPhone, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro in September of last year. The regular iPhone 14 doesn't really offer much in the way of major upgrades. It features the same processor as the old iPhone 13 Pro, a slightly improved camera, and that's really about it. The iPhone 14 Pro, on the other hand, was a massive upgrade. It featured the all-new Dynamic Island instead of a notch, a fantastic new 48MP camera, and a new Always-On Display that can show notifications and wallpapers.\n\nApple's new mid-year color has become something of a tradition in recent years. On March 8, 2022, Apple introduced two new green finishes for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro. The Pro finish was a bit darker, but they were very similar in shade.\n\nIn April of 2021, Apple introduced a new purple iPhone 12, however, last year was the first time we got a new shade for both the regular and Pro lineup.\n\nThe mid-year release is always interesting given that we're expecting a new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and an iPhone 15 Pro Max in just six months. Apple is expected to unveil a hefty upgrade to iPhone in September featuring the A17 chip (in the Pro), big camera upgrades, a new design, and more.",

                    "body": "A beautiful yellow joins the lineup, with incredible battery life, a powerful dual-camera system for pro-level photos and videos, and groundbreaking safety capabilities, including Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif., March 07, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today announced a new yellow iPhone\u00ae 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, adding even more color choices to the lineup this spring. Beautifully designed and built to last, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have a durable Ceramic Shield\u00ae front cover, an updated internal design for better sustained performance and easier repairs, and amazing battery life -- with iPhone 14 Plus offering the longest battery life of any iPhone ever. Both models include a dual-camera system for stunning photos and videos, the powerful A15 Bionic chip, and innovative safety capabilities including Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection. The new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available to pre-order this Friday, March 10, with availability starting Tuesday, March 14.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230307005547/en/\n\nA beautiful yellow color joins the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus lineup. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\n\"People love their iPhone and rely on it every day for all that they do, and now there's an exciting addition to the lineup with a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \"The extraordinary battery life, lightweight design, pro-level camera and video features, groundbreaking safety capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite, and all iOS 16 has to offer make iPhone 14 a great option for anyone in the market for a new iPhone.\"\n\nA Beautiful and Durable Design with Amazing Battery Life\n\nThe 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus feature a durable aerospace-grade aluminum design that is water- and dust-resistant, with a Ceramic Shield front cover that is tougher than any other smartphone glass, protecting iPhone from common spills and accidents. An updated internal design provides better sustained performance -- great for heavy workloads and high-powered gaming -- while improving ease and affordability of repairs. Both models include a gorgeous Super Retina XDR\u00ae display with OLED technology that supports 1200 nits of peak HDR brightness, along with support for Dolby Vision. The larger display of iPhone 14 Plus is fantastic for watching content, streaming Apple Fitness+\u2120 workouts, and playing games, while boasting the longest battery life of any iPhone ever.\n\nA Powerful Dual-Camera System to Capture Every Moment\n\nWith iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, users have an advanced dual-camera system right in their pockets. The system features an impressive new pro-level Main camera with a larger sensor for gorgeous photos and videos, as well as an Ultra Wide camera to capture unique perspectives. Both iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus include the new front TrueDepth\u00ae camera that automatically focuses on multiple subjects at different distances for sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. And the larger aperture captures brighter color and finer detail in low-light scenes.\n\nThe iPhone 14 lineup introduced Photonic Engine, improving mid- to low-light performance for photos across all cameras compared to the previous generation: up to 2x on the TrueDepth and Ultra Wide cameras, and 2.5x on the new Main camera. Photonic Engine is able to preserve subtle textures, provide better color, and maintain more information in a photo through a deep integration of hardware and software.\n\nVideo features like Action mode and Cinematic mode are available across the iPhone 14 lineup to help users unleash their creativity. Action mode enables smooth-looking video that adjusts to significant shakes and motion -- even when video is being captured in the middle of the action. Cinematic mode supports 4K at 30 fps and 4K at 24 fps, enabling a beautiful depth-of-field effect that automatically changes focus in a simple and intuitive way to capture cinema-style moments.\n\nGroundbreaking Safety Capabilities for Peace of Mind\n\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus offer critical safety capabilities that can provide emergency assistance when it matters most. Emergency SOS via satellite allows users to message with emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available through a combination of custom-designed components and deeply integrated software. Additionally, if users want to reassure friends and family of their whereabouts while off the grid, they can open the Find My\u00ae app and share their location via satellite. This service -- which has already helped users in emergency situations in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the U.K. -- will come to Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal later this month.\n\nCrash Detection on the iPhone 14 lineup can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone. Apple-designed motion algorithms trained with over a million hours of real-world driving and crash record data combine with motion inputs from the new accelerometer and gyroscope, GPS, barometer, and microphone on iPhone to bring this innovative safety feature to life. When paired with Apple Watch\u00ae, Crash Detection seamlessly leverages the unique strength of both devices to get users help efficiently.\n\nPowered by A15 Bionic with 5-core GPU\n\nA15 Bionic brings powerful, pro-level performance to iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The 5-core GPU enables faster speeds for demanding workloads and even smoother graphics for video apps and high-performance gaming. A15 Bionic also powers camera features like Photonic Engine, Action mode, and Cinematic mode -- all while delivering extraordinary battery life and protecting critical privacy and security features like data encryption using the Secure Enclave. The 6-core CPU with two performance and four efficiency cores handles intensive tasks with ease, and the 16-core Neural Engine is capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features in iOS 16 and third-party app experiences.\n\nFeaturing iOS 16\n\niOS 16 features the biggest update ever to the Lock Screen, with a multilayered effect that artfully sets subjects of photos in front of the time, widgets that offer information at a glance, and a new wallpaper gallery for inspiration. Focus gets even more powerful with a new way to connect to the Lock Screen and create Focus filters within apps. Live Activities help users stay on top of things that are happening in real time, such as a sports game or ride-share, right from the Lock Screen. In Messages, users can edit a message, undo send, and mark conversations as unread. Browsing in Safari\u00ae gets even safer with passkeys, a next-generation credential that can't be phished or leaked. Live Text\u00ae adds the ability to interact with text in video, quickly convert currency, and translate text. Users can also tap and hold on the subject of an image to lift it from the background and place it in apps like Messages. iCloud\u00ae Shared Photo Library offers a new way to seamlessly share photos with up to six family members. And with Apple Music\u00ae Sing, users can sing along to their favorite songs with adjustable vocals and real-time lyrics.\n\niPhone and the Environment\n\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are designed to minimize their impact on the environment, including antenna lines that use upcycled plastic water bottles that have been chemically transformed into a stronger, higher-performance material. In addition to featuring a re-architected internal design that offers improved repairability, iPhone 14 models also use 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, including those in MagSafe\u00ae, and 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine\u00ae. Both models also include 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of multiple printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards and in the wire of all cameras. Fiber-based packaging does not use outer plastic wrap, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025.\n\nToday, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across its entire manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact.\n\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple's five software platforms -- iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS -- provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple's more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n\nNOTE TO EDITORS: For additional information visit Apple Newsroom (www.apple.com/newsroom), or email Apple's Media Helpline at media.help@apple.com.\n\n\u00a9 2023 Apple Inc.

No new color was announced for the higher end iPhone 14 Pro series.\n\nThe yellow finish will be available to order beginning this Friday, with first units arriving to customers on March 14. Apple also refreshed its lineup of accessories today, so you can complement the new yellow iPhone with a new spring-themed iPhone case.\n\nAs you might expect, the yellow iPhone 14 features yellow aluminium sides and a yellow glass back. Yellow joins the existing color lineup options of midnight, starlight PRODUCT(RED), blue, and purple.\n\nAside from the yellow color, the phone is otherwise unchanged.\n\nAs a reminder, iPhone 14 sports a 6.1-inch OLED display and the 14 Plus is larger at 6.7-inches. The phones are powered by the A15 chip, first introduced in the iPhone 13 Pro. New features included 'Action mode' super stabilization for video recording and the addition of the fake-bokeh-effect Cinematic mode for video.\n\niPhone 14 also features Emergency SOS via Satellite, which allows owners to contact emergency services even if they are away from normal cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. Emergency SOS via Satellite is currently free for two years; Apple has not announced pricing.\n\nEmergency SOS via Satellite is currently available in the US, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom and Ireland. Alongside the yellow iPhone 14 announcement, Apple announced that the satellite connectivity features are launching in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Portugal later in March.",

The new models don't otherwise come with any changes but might help Apple continue to sell more phones during what would otherwise be a slower period following the holiday rush.\n\nThe iPhone 14 originally arrived last September, with the Pro and Pro Max models as the first to come with Apple's new Dynamic Island. While Apple has since been updating its iPhone 14 lineup with a number of new features, including a satellite connectivity feature that lets you contact emergency responders without cellular service, third-party apps have been adding support for the status indicator afforded by the device's Dynamic Island.",

                    "body": "The new shade is the first iPhone since the iPhone 11 to come in yellow. Before that, the iPhone XR and iPhone 5C also came in the color.\n\nThe yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus carry on Apple's tradition of releasing new colors for its iPhones in the spring to boost sales. In 2022, the spring color was green and in 2021, the iPhone 12 came out in purple.\n\nIt's a smart strategy to give iPhones a mid-cycle push as new high-end Android phones like the Galaxy S23 Ultra and OnePlus 11 are announced.\n\nThe outside looks new, but the inside is the same. The iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display; the iPhone 14 Plus has a larger 6.7-inch screen. Both come with Apple's A15 Bionic chip with 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine; both come in storage capacities of 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB. Both models have a dual-camera system with 12-megapixel main and 12-megapixel ultrawide lenses; both have 12-megapixel selfie cameras with autofocus; both can shoot stabilized video with Action Mode. Same Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite features.\n\nYou can find a complete tech spec comparison here on Apple's website.\n\nThe new yellow iPhone 14 and 14 Plus start at the same pricing as the other colors, starting at $799 and $899, respectively, for 126GB of storage. Both models are available starting March 14.",

                    "body": "According to a new report, the Apple iPhone SE 4 will utilize a $40 BOE display. As some of you may recall, a report that surfaced at the end of last month suggested that the iPhone SE 4 is not canceled after all.\n\nBack in September last year, reports started coming in saying that the phone is not happening. Well, it seems like Apple changed its mind, though we'll have to wait until next year in order to get the phone.\n\nThis time around, things will be much different. The iPhone SE 4 will be a lot larger than its predecessors. Apple will finally ditch the iPhone 8 design. The iPhone SE 4 will be based on the iPhone 14 design, actually.\n\nTherefore, it will utilize a 6.1-inch panel, just like the iPhone 14. That display will be provided by BOE if the report is to be believed, and it costs around $40. It will be an OLED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate.\n\nBy sourcing the display from BOE, Apple is trying to keep the price down, of course. For comparison's sake, the display that Apple plans to use in the iPhone 15 models and the OLED iPads are set to cost around $100. Those panels will be provided by Samsung Display and LG Display, allegedly.\n\nNot much is known about the iPhone SE 4, other than its design, and display info. The phone may, however, launch in March 2024. The iPhone SE 3 arrived in March 2022, so it would make sense. We're only guessing, though.\n\nNow, considering that the iPhone 14 chassis will be used, Apple will probably stick to some of the same components. For example, the phone may utilize the same battery pack. So, we may get a 3,279mAh unit.\n\nWe're not sure what SoC Apple will be using, though. You can expect stereo speakers to be a part of the package, however, and, of course, the latest version of iOS available at the time.",

                    "body": "The iPhone is immensely popular on a global scale and the latest research data reveals how Apple dominated the smartphone industry in 2022. The iPhone 13 was the most popular iPhone followed by the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Scroll down to read more details on how Samsung performed in the list of top ten best-selling smartphones list for 2022.\n\nAndroid smartphones have gotten a bit stale when it comes to introducing new features. Even if Google announces new features in its latest Android updates, it takes months before they are available on non-Pixel devices. Apple, on the other hand, brings new features and updates to the entire compatible iPhone lineup together. This is one of the reasons why customers prefer to buy an iPhone over an Android.\n\nAnother reason why eight iPhone models have taken their place in the list of top ten best-selling smartphones for 2022 is software updates. With the latest iPhone models, you can expect the device to feature support for at least five years. Furthermore, Apple will keep users up to date with the latest security updates for a long time. Check out how different iPhone models performed in the list of top 10 best-selling smartphones for 2022.\n\nAccording to research conducted by Counterpoint, the iPhone 13 was the best-selling iPhone from its debut in 2021 till the launch of the iPhone 14 with a 28 percent share of total iPhone sales. Additionally, the demand for the device remained strong even after its successor. This is partly because the iPhone 14 did not bring any major changes to the table. The design was identical along with the chip powering the device. On top of this, Apple also slashed the price of the device, which is another reason why the device gained traction.\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro Max took the second spot on the list with half as many devices sold as the standard model in the same period. Furthermore, the iPhone 14 Pro Max took the third spot which is a win for the device given it launched only six months ago. Samsung's Galaxy A13 took the fourth spot which is the company's budget phone. The Galaxy A03 also took the tenth spot on the list.\n\nIt is surprising to see how Apple completely owned the list of different iPhone models. It is worth noting that no other flagship Android smartphone made it to the list. We will share more details on the story as soon as further details are available.

                    "body": "After rumors that the iPhone 14 series would get a new yellow color last week, Apple announced this new option for its current generation of iPhone models.\n\nThe iPhone 14 lineup was introduced in September, but the Plus model was the one that took an extra month to arrive. While this generation marks the end of the mini phones due to poor sales, Apple still seems to be struggling with its non-premium models as they lack new features.\n\nThat said, here's what you need to know about the iPhone 14 and its new yellow color.\n\nAvailable in 6.1- and 6.7-inch models, the iPhone 14 has a similar design to the iPhone 13 series. While on the outside, they both look identical, Apple has improved its internal architecture to offer a better repairability of the back glass and improve performance with the A15 Bionic chip from the iPhone 13 Pro.\n\nApple has added a new Crash Detection feature, which your iPhone can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services when a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone. These capabilities build on existing components, like the barometer, which can now detect cabin pressure changes, the GPS for additional input for speed changes, and the microphone, which can recognize loud noises typified by severe car crashes.\n\nAnother improvement for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models available with the yellow option regards their cameras. The Cinematic Mode now offers 4K up to 30fps recordings, and a new Action Mode gives hyperstabilization when recording while running, cycling, etc.\n\nMore specifically, the iPhone 14 Plus offers the best battery life on an iPhone, so if you're looking for a bigger display and an all-day battery, this is the phone to choose.\n\nLast but not least, the new models offer Satellite connectivity, which means you can text or call someone in an area without cellular coverage. The Emergency SOS via satellite is free during the first two years users start using it. It's already available in the US, Canada, and a few European countries.\n\niPhone 14 costs $799, and iPhone 14 Plus $899. This new yellow color is available to purchase Friday, March 10, with availability starting Tuesday, March 14.",

                    "body": "An alleged real-world image of the right side of an iPhone 15 model's chassis has today been shared online, showing a cutout for the Side button and a black or \"Midnight\" finish.\n\nThe image, shared by Twitter user @lipilipsi, purportedly shows several chassis for one of the iPhone 15 models. The cutout for the Side button aligns with renders of the iPhone 15 Pro, which is expected to move to solid-state buttons with haptic feedback, but this is the first time it has been seen in real-world images.\n\nIt is unclear whether the image shows a standard iPhone 15 or an iPhone 15 Pro model. The chassis seems to be anodized in a black or \"Midnight\" color with a matte finish, which would indicate a standard iPhone 15 model in contrast to the iPhone 15 Pro's brushed titanium finish, but, on the other hand, only this year's \"Pro\" models are expected to get solid-state buttons.\n\nIt is likely the case that the image does actually show a standard iPhone 15 model, and the cutout is actually designed for a mechanical button, since the two standard iPhone models are not expected to get haptic buttons this year.",

                    "body": "New data from Counterpoint Research today shows just how dominant the iPhone lineup really is. According to the data, not only was the iPhone 13 the \"best-selling smartphone\" of 2022, the entire iPhone lineup accounted for eight out of the top 10 spots on the best-selling smartphone list for 2022.\n\nCounterpoint Research says that the iPhone 13 accounted for 28% of all iPhone sales in 20222 and 5% of the total global smartphone sales in 2022. The iPhone 13 Pro Max follows in second place, with 2.6% of total smartphone sales. The top five is rounded out by the iPhone 14 Pro Max in third, the Samsung Galaxy A13 in fourth, and the iPhone 13 Pro in fifth.\n\nApple's iPhone 13 was the best-selling smartphone of 2022, contributing 28% of iPhone sales. It was the best-selling smartphone in major markets such as China, US, UK, Germany and France. Further, the iPhone 13 remained the number one smartphone each month from its launch in September 2021 till August 2022. Price cuts after the iPhone 14 series' launch further drove the iPhone 13 volumes in developing markets. The iPhone 13 sales were two times more than that of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the second best-selling smartphone in 2022.\n\nThe inclusion of the iPhone 14 Pro Max in the top five is particularly notable. Counterpoint Research says this is the first time an iPhone \"Pro Max\" has driven more sales value than its \"Pro\" and base counterparts have:\n\nFor the first time, a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models in 2022. It helped the iPhone 14 Pro Max to capture the third spot in the 2022 list. It was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October and November of 2022. The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant.\n\nHere is a full breakdown of the top 10 best-selling smartphones of 2022:\n\nAs you can see, the only iPhone 14 model not to make the list is the seemingly cursed iPhone 14 Plus. For the iPhone 13 lineup, the iPhone 13 mini is nowhere to be found.\n\nDo the results of the \"best-selling smartphone\" list of 2022 surprise you at all? Let us know down in the comments.",

                    "body": "A new iPhone 15 leak suggests Apple is planning to bring Dynamic Island to all new iPhones, which will also sport new curved bezels.\n\nWhile Apple is still mum on its plan to launch the next-gen iPhones, the iPhone 15 series rumour mill has been in full swing lately. In fact, some CAD renders of the iPhone 15 surfaced online last month.\n\nTipster ShrimpApplePro (SAP) has divulged a few key details about the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro displays recently. SAP has a reputation for sharing accurate product details before its official unveiling. The clip included in the first tweet was originally posted to the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin. A similar video was shared on the Shanghai-based video-sharing website Bilibili (aka B Site).\n\nHowever, the video has been deleted on Douyin. ShrimpApplePro shared another tweet showing one of the display glasses housed inside a 3D-printed dummy. The clip gave fans an idea of what the final product could look like.\n\nSince the dummy is designed to give third-party companies that develop screen protectors an idea of the screen, it lacks ports, cameras, and buttons. Last month, some iPhone 15 Pro CAD renders popped up on the web, confirming the presence of the USB Type-C port. Also, the leaked renders suggest the device will adopt a slightly different design than the current-gen iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nSAP claims Apple plans to bring the fan-favourite Dynamic Island to all four models in the iPhone 15 lineup. Notably, the feature is exclusive to the more expensive iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. The Dynamic Island can be seen on the glass panels in the video shared by the leaker.\n\nApple could oust the traditional iPhone notch in favour of a couple of cutouts in the screen. These cutouts are joined on display by a pill-shaped area showing ongoing activities and various notifications.\n\nThe next-generation iPhone models could sport a slightly curved bezel that appears about halfway into the screen's border. This will probably complement the iPhone 15's curved rear glass. Still, it will not be as curved as the curved-edge display on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.\n\nSAP suggests the non-Pro models will sport thicker bezel despite this change. Apple will reportedly release small or large versions of the standard and Pro models as it normally does. However, there will be a slight difference between the display sizes of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro.\n\nAccording to previously leaked renders, the basic version of the iPhone 15 will sport a larger 6.2-inch screen. On the other hand, the iPhone 15 Pro model will feature a 6.1 inches display across like its predecessor. The iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro Max, for their part, will have 6.7 inches displays like their precursors.\n\nApple isn't likely to start teasing the iPhone 15 series anytime soon. In the meantime, the upcoming iPhone models will likely continue floating around the rumour mill. Equally noted tipster Ice Universe recently claimed that the iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPhone 15 Ultra could be buttonless. If this speculation turns out to be true, it will be one of the biggest design changes for iPhones.\n\nLeaked renders show that the newest iPhones will have solid-state haptic buttons. To recall, analyst Ming-Chi-Kuo also indicated that the iPhone 15 Pro series would lack physical buttons. The new solid-state buttons reportedly respond to a user's touch without requiring them to press the button physically. This will resemble the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8's home button design.",

                    "body": "We feared the iPhone 15 would inherit the iPhone 14's display, and that may indeed be real as leaker yeux1122 (opens in new tab) of Korean social network Naver says Apple won't use its LTPO-enhanced 120Hz ProMotion displays on the basic iPhone 15\n\nWith the ProMotion panels saved once again for the iPhone 15 Pro models, this likely means 60Hz displays again for the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and no always-on display option either. If that is true, then Apple's once more doing its customers a disservice.\n\nApple is notorious for being slow to update parts of its phones, but the way it's holding out on updating its basic iPhone displays is absurd. In 2023, even cheap phones from other brands are offering at least 90Hz refresh rates for their phones, like the $599 Google Pixel 7. The iPhone 14 starts at $799, and presumably the iPhone 15 will have the same starting price.\n\nThe only possible excuse Apple could use is that a higher refresh rate impacts battery life, but even that doesn't hold water. Take a look at our battery testing results for the Galaxy S23 and OnePlus 11 Pro, and you can see they easily beat the basic iPhones, both at 60Hz and in their full adaptive 120Hz modes.\n\nWhile this 60Hz rumor spells bad news for the iPhone 15, there are more positive things we've heard about the new iPhones' screens. For instance, the display driver chip could be more efficient, while the top iPhone 14 Pro Max model could be getting an even higher max brightness rating. The display may also curve slightly, like older iPhone models, making it fit better in your hand.\n\nIn terms of functionality, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus should also offer the Dynamic Island feature, which means that you'll be able to see alerts and Live Activities at the top of the display. And if the Dynamic Island is on all four new iPhones, perhaps more developers will embrace it.\n\nNevertheless, sticking with a 60Hz display in 2023 seems like a dumb move if in fact this latest leak is real.

                    "body": "It seems like Apple may announce a new iPhone 14 color soon. Back on March 8 last year, the Green iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were announced. So, tomorrow will be exactly a year since then.\n\nSo, when can we expect Apple to announce a new iPhone 14 color? Well, very soon. According to reports, there is a product briefing taking place with Apple's PR team today, March 7.\n\nOn top of that, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that a new iPhone 14 color is \"imminent\". Gurman is usually spot on when it comes to Apple-related info, so we have no reason to doubt him.\n\nWhat color can we expect this time around? Well, a yellow variant of the iPhone 14 is expected. Just to be clear, both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will become available in this new color.\n\nThe phone's design will, of course, remain unchanged. The only thing that will change is the paint job. Now, aaple_lab did create a concept of a yellow iPhone 14, just to give you an idea of what we may get. That concept image is shown below.\n\nApple will likely use a different shade of yellow, though it could be close to this, we cannot be sure. Needless to say, this colorway will grab some attention, so if that's what you're looking for, this will be right up your alley.\n\nAs a reminder, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus launched on September 7, along with the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max. The devices have been out for about half a year at this point, which is when Apple usually spices things up a bit.\n\nWe'll probably get more info about the new iPhone 14 color soon. In fact, Apple may even make an official announcement in the coming days.",

                    "body": "Apple's iPhones are constantly ranked among the top 10 most-popular smartphones each year, with seven iPhones in the top 10 in 2021. Now, it looks like Apple has gone one better in 2022.\n\nCounterpoint Research reports that eight out of the top 10 most-popular phones in 2022 were iPhones. This marks the first time that Apple devices occupied eight of the 10 slots.\n\nAs for the top three devices, they were the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro Max, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max respectively. Other Apple devices that made the list were the iPhone 13 Pro (fifth), iPhone 12 (sixth), iPhone 14 (seventh), iPhone 14 Pro (eighth), and iPhone SE 2022 (ninth).\n\nThe tracking company also noted the significance of the iPhone 14 Pro Max out-selling its standard and Pro stablemates. It's also notable that the iPhone 14 Plus didn't even crack the top 10, suggesting that the handset is indeed a sales dud for Apple.\n\nEither way, it looks like Android OEMs have an uphill battle on their hands if they want their phones to hit the top 10 in 2023. But that's much easier said than done owing to a sagging global smartphone market.",

Launched in September 2022, the iPhone 14 series includes the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nMacRumors\n\nIt appears that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models are getting a new colour variant, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. In a recent Tweet, Gurman said that a new colour variant is \"imminent,\" following in the footsteps of the green iPhone 13 variant that was also released mid-cycle last year this time.\n\nEven then, it's unclear what the new iPhone colour could be. But a different report claims that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models could be launched in the yellow colour.\n\nMac OTAKARA\n\nAlso read: iPhone 15 Pro Front Glass Leak Suggests That Super Thin Bezels Are Coming\n\nCurrently, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models are available in five colour options - Blue, Purple, Starlight, Midnight, and (Product) RED - in three storage options including 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. For the base iPhone 14 model, the price begins at \u20b979,900 while the iPhone 14 Plus model starts at \u20b989,900.\n\nUnsplash\n\nThis pattern follows what Apple pursued with its iPhone 13 series. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were initially released in Pink, Midnight, Blue, Starlight, and (Product) RED options, followed by a Green variant that was released in March 2022. The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max variants that originally launched in Silver, Gold, Graphite, and Sierra Blue colours were also made available in Alpine Green.",

It is slated to launch in September this year.",

                    "body": "Word recently broke of Apple's plans to launch an iPhone SE 4 after all. The budget device was initially claimed to have been canceled but now looks to be back on track for a 2024 release. According to a new report, Apple is sourcing OLED panels from China for the budget phone.\n\nAs revealed by Korean paper The Elec, the iPhone SE 4 is poised to debut in 2024 featuring OLED screens made by BOE. That may come as a bit of a surprise as Apple famously had issues with the Chinese supplier last year. In either case, it appears BOE will make the iPhone SE 4's displays, with the source indicating the phone will sport a 60 Hz 6.1-inch screen with technical specifications identical to the iPhone 13's.\n\nReportedly, Apple is procuring about 20 million units of said OLED panels for the iPhone SE 4, in line with numbers for the two previous iPhone SE generations. The iPhone SE 4 will, of course, be the first iPhone SE model to sport an OLED screen, with previous iterations all making do with LCDs.\n\nNo good news for expectant fans of the vanilla iPhone 15 models, however. According to supply chain insider Ross Young, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will both arrive with 60 Hz AMOLED displays, like the generations before them -- with Apple reserving the higher refresh rate screens for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max instead.\n\nRoss Young purports that this is due to a lack of capacity to support all four models with the required LTPO displays. Cost is likely a deterrent as well, with The Elec claiming regular 60 Hz AMOLED panels as seen on the iPhone 14 cost about US$40 per unit, with the 120 Hz LTPO displays used on the Pro models costing north of US$100 in comparison.",

                    "body": "Apple was easily the most popular smartphone brand last year, with eight of its iPhone models featuring in a list of 10 best-selling smartphones.\n\nThat's according to CounterPoint Research's Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker, which establishes Apple as the first brand to occupy so many spots in its top 10. The remaining two spots were taken by Samsung.\n\nAccording to the report, Apple's iPhone 13 was the best-selling smartphone of 2022, contributing 28% of iPhone sales and achieving best-selling smartphone status in major markets such as China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nCounterpoint's data suggests that the iPhone 13 remained the number one smartphone each month from its launch in September 2021 until August 2022, with price cuts after the launch of the iPhone 14 further driving iPhone 13 sales in developing markets.\n\nCompared to the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which was the second best-selling smartphone of 2022, twice as many iPhone 13 models were sold, underlining the device's broad popularity across markets. With reference to the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the report notes that:\n\nFor the first time, a Pro Max variant of an iPhone series drove more volume than its Pro and base models in 2022. It helped the iPhone 14 Pro Max to capture the third spot in the 2022 list. It was the top-selling smartphone model for September, October and November of 2022. The iPhone 14 Pro Max sales were led by early adopters and those upgrading to a higher iPhone variant.\n\nElsewhere, robust sales in the U.S., Japan, and China saw the iPhone 12 - the best-selling smartphone of 2021 - hold sixth spot above the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro, despite being the oldest Apple handset in the list. The iPhone SE (2022) meanwhile took the tenth spot, with strong sales in Japan giving it a boost.\n\n\"We believe the share of the top 10 smartphones will increase in 2023 as brands focus on clearing inventory and optimizing their launches,\" said Counterpoint analysts Harshit Rastogi and Karn Chauhan. \"We also expect brands to continue making their portfolios leaner in 2023 to minimize cannibalization. The number of active smartphone models in the global market has already fallen from over 4,200 in 2021 to around 3,600 in 2022.\"\n\nIn 2023, Apple continues to sell the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone 14 series and the third-generation iPhone SE, underlining the continuing popularity of its older models among new and returning customers.",

                    "body": "Even though earlier rumours revealed that Apple has cancelled the iPhone SE 4 due to concerns over its first in-house 5G chip. A new report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple is restarting the development of the iPhone SE with a 6.1-inch OLED display and a custom 5G chip.\n\nNow, a report from The Elec in Korea says that it will use OLED display from China-based BOE instead of Samsung and LG displays present in the current iPhone models with an OLED screen.\n\nIt was reported that BOE will supply OLED panels for the iPhone 15 series in 2023, but the new report says that it has missed the initial volume of OLED panels due to challenges in the production of OLED screen with a punch-hole / dynamic island, so these have gone to Samsung and LG instead.\n\n\"Since it is a low-end product, it is reasonable for Apple to optimize using parts inventory,\" says the report. The price of LTPS OLED for the 6.1-inch iPhone SE4 is currently estimated to be around $40, which is less than half of the LTPO OLED panel used in the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nSamsung will still supply OLED panels for all the iPhone 15 series models released this year. LG Display will focus on LTPO models for the Pro with relatively smaller production capacity than Samsung Display, says the report.\n\nHowever, the iPhone 15 and the 15 Plus models are still said to use 60Hz OLED displays instead of 120Hz LTPO panels in the iPhone 15 Pro models. Earlier rumours and renders already revealed that all the models will use Dynamic island.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 with the new OLED screen, thinner bezels and its own 5G modem is expected to release in 2024.",

                    "body": "Smaller bezels, solid-state volume rocker, and Dynamic Island for all.\n\nAt this point, Apple might as well just put the iPhone 15 up for preorder. According to the latest series of leaks, several smaller rumors have seemingly been confirmed as a full picture of this year's update comes into view.\n\nThe first leak comes courtesy of 9to5Mac, confirming an earlier rumor by @ZoneofTech on Twitter that claimed the iPhone 15 will have a single \"LONG Unified Volume button, rather than 2 separate ones.\" 9to5Mac adds that Apple \"will ditch the separate volume up and volume down buttons for a new single button that works both ways depending on where the user presses it.\"\n\nApple used a volume rocker for the first three iPhones as well as the iPhone 6 and 6s, but has used separate volume up and down buttons since the iPhone 7. According to reports, the button on the iPhone 15 Pro models will be capacitive, meaning they won't move but the software will give the appearance of movement, like the trackpad on the MacBooks.\n\nEven more interesting is the mute switch, which has been a mainstay since the original model launched in 2007. While Apple isn't taking it away, 9to5Mac reports it will become a \"pressing type\" button instead of a switch. It's not clear from the report how it would work, but users will presumably need to either long-press or force-press it to silence the phone. That's a distinct change from the current switch that lets you quickly silence your iPhone without even looking at the screen.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate leak from ShrimpApplePro on Twitter showed off three of the iPhone 15 glass panels with significantly smaller bezels and the addition of the Dynamic Island to all models. The video appears to show off two smaller displays and a larger one, which would presumably be the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, and iPhone 15 Pro.\n\nSome rumors have reported that Apple is increasing the size of the iPhone 15 to 6.2 inches, which could account for the three sizes: 6.1 inches for the iPhone 15 Pro, 6.2 inches for the iPhone 15, and 6.7 inches for the iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro Max/Ultra.\n\nFor all the latest news and rumors about this year's new handsets, visit our regularly updated iPhone 15 superguide.",

                    "body": "Apple is reportedly planning to launch new iPhone cases this spring, introducing at least two new colors.\n\nThe Twitter leaker known as \"Majin Bu\" recently claimed that Apple plans to make its MagSafe Leather Case available in two additional colors for the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max, as part of an upcoming spring collection refresh. The added colors would be Deep Violet and Golden Brown, both of which Apple has offered in the past. Existing color options for the case include Umber, Forest Green, Ink, Midnight, and Orange.\n\nDeep Violet was a color option for the iPhone 12 series of Leather Cases, while Golden Brown remains an option for the iPhone 13 series of Leather Cases. Apple also offered the iPhone Leather Wallet and AirTag Leather Key Ring in Golden Brown.\n\nApple has recycled iPhone case colors in the past, so the rumor is highly plausible. For example, one of the current iPhone 14 Leather Case color options is Forest Green, which was previously available for the iPhone 11 Leather Case. Majin Bu has accurately leaked iPhone case colors in the past, although their track record is not perfect with regards to wider Apple rumors.\n\niPhone case and Apple Watch band color options are often refreshed on a seasonal basis. Apple debuted new spring color options for iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands on Tuesday, March 8 last year, so new color options could be announced as early as today if Apple sticks to the same schedule this year. Moreover, a other recent rumors suggest that a new version of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in Yellow could be announced simultaneously as part of a wider spring refresh.",

                    "body": "Solid-state buttons could be a big change for iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max\n\nHow different will the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max be, compared to the entry-level iPhone 15? Rumors suggest that Apple will do more to differentiate the various models, and the latest suggests that'll involve swapping physical buttons for a solid-state alternative.\n\nIt's a rumor we've heard a few times before, but the change may not be quite what you were expecting. According to YouTuber ZoneofTech (opens in new tab), Apple may introduce a single capacitive volume rocker rather than two distinct buttons. Presumably, it will work as you'd expect, pressing the top ramps up the volume and pressing the bottom decreases it again.\n\nApparently the proof is in iPhone 15 Pro CAD files, which features two hardware pins where the volume button should be. Normally iPhones need four of those pins, two for each separate button. Half the pins means, in theory, half the buttons.\n\nZoneOfTech also claims that the iPhone's mute switch will also be swapped out for a capacitive button -- one that would switch silent mode on and off at the push of a button. It's claimed that Apple will be adding at least two more Taptic Engines to the phone, in an attempt to mimic the feel of an ordinary button.\n\nA switch to solid state buttons with haptics, instead of mechanical buttons, could have a bunch of benefits. Fewer components means fewer points of failure, and a haptic engine won't wear out over time the same way a mechanical switch might.\n\nDitching buttons for a more seamless frame might also prove beneficial for durability. Not having a break or gap in the frame will stop water or dust getting inside the phone, and could minimize weak spots in the process.\n\nOf course, there may be some problems with opting for this new design too. For starters, the iPhone's volume and power buttons can be used together to force a faulty phone to restart or go into recovery mode. Apple's going to have to devise an alternative, which means people are going to have to relearn how to do a hard reset. Much like when the screenshot action changed after the iPhone X ditched the home button.\n\nAnother possible problem may well depend on the sensitivity of the new solid-state buttons, and how easily they can be activated by mistake. You don't want to put your phone in your pocket or a bag and have the phone unmuted because it knocked against something without you realizing it.\n\nWhile rumors of the iPhone 15 Ultra's hyper-durability may make protective cases seem unnecessary, it's unlikely that cases will go away completely. So it'll also be interesting to see how case-makers would adapt to these rumored changes, particularly the ones that offer heavy-duty protection.\n\nThis is all rumored for the time being, and there's no guarantee that this is what Apple is planning. While this rumor has come up more than once, we're going to have to wait and see what the iPhone 15 Pro range has in store for us. If Apple follows its usual schedule we're likely to see the phones arrive sometime in September.",

                    "body": "You can already get the iPhone 14 in five different colors, but it looks very likely that there will soon be a sixth option to choose from.\n\nMark Gurman (opens in new tab) - a reputable Bloomberg journalist and leaker - has claimed (via MacRumors (opens in new tab)) that \"a new iPhone 14 color is indeed imminent.\" Gurman has a superb track record, so we're inclined to believe them, and while they didn't get specific about what this new iPhone shade would be, we can make our own educated guess.\n\nYou see, this isn't the first we've heard of a new iPhone 14 color. Just a few days ago, another source suggested that the iPhone 14 would soon be available in a yellow shade.\n\nWhile the latter source doesn't have Gurman's track record, MacRumors (opens in new tab) claims to have heard from multiple sources that Apple has a product briefing planned for this week. As such, we can be almost certain that Apple has an imminent announcement to make, and it's probably to do with a new iPhone 14 color, with yellow being the most likely option.\n\nThere's also form for this on Apple's part, as a green shade was launched for the iPhone 13 this time last year, and a purple color for the iPhone 12 the year before that.\n\nWe hope it really is yellow that's planned for the iPhone 14 this year, because with the exception of red, all the current shades are quite pale and understated, so we could use more bright colors. Of course, the yellow might be a pale yellow, too, but it's still likely to be more showy than the likes of white and black.\n\nOh, and if the iPhone 14 is getting a new color, then the same color will almost certainly come to the iPhone 14 Plus as well, since the two phones are currently available in an identical selection of shades. What's less clear is whether the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max will be available in a new color, too. If they are, it might be a slightly different shade.\n\nWe can only guess at which day, exactly, Apple will make this announcement, though (as mentioned) we know it'll happen sometime this week.\n\nThat said, Apple tends to prefer announcing things on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. Indeed, the green color last year was unveiled on a Tuesday, and so was the purple the year before, so Tuesday is our best guess.\n\nIt's Tuesday now at the time of writing, so the new iPhone 14 shade's arrival really could be imminent, and will hopefully add some much-needed brightness to the current selection of iPhone 14 colors.",

Apple announced new Green colors for the iPhone 13 series on Tuesday, March 8 last year, so there is a chance the briefing is related to a new iPhone color being announced as soon as today, but its specific subject has yet to be confirmed.\n\nApple usually introduces new iPhone color options in the spring to boost sales midway through the device's product cycle. Last March, Apple introduced a new Green color for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, and a new Alpine Green color for the iPhone 13 Pro models. In April 2021, Apple made the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini available in Purple.\n\nApple last offered a Yellow color option for the iPhone in 2019 with the iPhone 11, which came just one year after the Yellow iPhone XR. It is unclear if Apple is planning a new color option for the iPhone 14 Pro models as well, but Yellow could be too similar to the existing Gold option for those devices.",

The next flagship series from Apple, the iPhone 15 series, is expected to launch at an Apple event later this year around the Fall. Although that is still months away, rumours and leaks about the upcoming iPhones have already flooded the market. Reports on everything from its design and camera to its hardware suggest that Apple is planning to make significant changes to the iPhone 15 series, especially to the iPhone 15 Pro models.\n\nNow, a recent report by Gizmochina has revealed that suppliers are expecting the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max to be high in demand due to the significant upgrades which are expected to be offered. One of the major reasons behind this increased demand could be due to the upcoming A17 Bionic processor which will likely power the iPhone 15 Pro models. According to reports, Apple has become the only smartphone manufacturer in the market to use 3nm manufacturing process in 2023 as the company has reportedly bought the entire first run of TSMC's N3 process semiconductors.\n\nThe A17 Bionic is not just expected to offer massive increase in performance, but it will also likely provide better energy efficiency, allowing the battery in these iPhones to last longer on a single charge.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to get a new periscope camera along with other camera upgrades. Moreover, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to feature a Samsung manufactured M13 display panel which will support peak brightness of up to 2500 nits, putting it massively ahead of other smartphones, according to leaker chunvn8888.\n\nMoreover, the iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to get a titanium frame with solid state volume and power buttons, rather than a stainless steel one, along with a new USB-C port which will replace Apple's proprietary lightning port. The upcoming iPhone 15 Pro will come in a new dark Red colour, according to a 9to5Mac report.",

                    "body": "\"A new iPhone 14 color is indeed imminent,\" says leaker and Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman (opens in new tab), so we'd prepare for a quiet announcement from Apple showing off the new phone hue. Particularly with AppleTrack (opens in new tab) reporting Apple has scheduled briefings today as well.\n\nThis alleged fresh color, which will apparently be yellow, had been previously claimed by a leak from Weibo. Now that Gurman, one of the most reliable Apple leakers around, has made this claim, it seems much more set in stone.\n\nStarting with the iPhone 12, Apple's launched a new color for its latest flagship phones each spring in order to revitalize interest. That's when we got the purple iPhone 12/iPhone 12 mini, and last year's green iPhone 13 and alpine green iPhone 13 Pro models. And as Gurman notes, it has been almost exactly a year since Apple announced the iPhone 13 series expanded color options, so the timing fits perfectly.\n\nYellow's an iPhone color we've seen much of. Up to now, only the iPhone 11 offered that particular color in any way, with its pastel hue perhaps offering some guidance on what sort of yellow Apple will be offering.\n\nWe don't know how a yellow color would look on a Pro model though, as these usually offer a matte finish instead of the non-Pro models' gloss. With Gold already an option for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple will likely lean into a brighter option if it is indeed plumping for yellow.\n\nWe may not see a new option for the Pro phones though, according to the rumor from over the weekend. This would match what Apple did with the iPhone 12 series, as the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max didn't get a new purple version. It'll be a shame not to have more choice when you're paying for a more expensive iPhone. But given that Apple's not had any trouble selling its iPhone 14 Pro handsets so far, arguably it doesn't need the boost a new color would provide.\n\nBeyond the color, these should still be the same iPhone 14 (and possibly iPhone 14 Pro) models that we already know and love, a.k.a. some of the best phones you can buy right now. You may want to wait for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro now that we're only six months out from their expected launch. But if you need an upgrade on the double, at least you should soon have a wider choice of iPhone color options to take your pick from right now.",

                    "body": "Rumors indicate that the iPhone 15 Pro will no longer have physical buttons for volume control\n\nThe leaks continue. We know more and more about the final design that will have the iPhone 15 Pro and everything seems to confirm what was already rumored at first. In addition to being made with a titanium frame, the new iPhone 15 will incorporate haptic buttons.\n\nThe absence of physical buttons seems to be one of the main features of the new iPhone to come. To replace them, we will have a pressure-sensitive surface that will emit small vibrations when we give it force with our fingers.\n\nHowever, this is not a new technology for iPhones either. Without going any further, the iPhone SE uses a haptic sensor to simulate pressure on the Home button. In this case, we are likely to see this new sensor but in the volume control of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nThere has also been speculation that Apple may eliminate the classic side mute switch, a feature that has been present on all bitten apple handsets since the iPhone 3G. In its place, we could have another haptic switch, just as would happen with the volume control.\n\nZONEOfTech, a well-known tech YouTuber, wrote on Twitter that the iPhone 15 Pro will feature a large button that unifies the volume controls. what is his basis for confirming this? He says that when designing a concept prototype of the iPhone 15 Pro, he saw that Apple used two pins in a single indentation where the volume buttons are located. Instead, the renders based on the iPhone 15 CAD project show two slots separated by four pins in total.\n\nOn the other hand, ZONEOfTech also claims the same with the mute switch. This would change to a \"regular push button, instead of the up and down switch we have now.\"\n\nThe iPhone 15s won't be the only ones to receive new features and now, it seems that Apple also wants to go a step further with the iPhone SE. According to MacRumors, BOE will supply the future OLED screens that will carry the next generation of iPhone SE. Although there were doubts about its continuation, the cheapest model of the iPhone will finally switch to OLED and will also debut a new design similar to the current iPhone 14.",

                    "body": "Apple's standard iPhone 15 models will not be equipped with an LPTO display, suggesting that the devices will continue to lack ProMotion support and an always-on display option like Apple's Pro models have.\n\nLast year's iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models used updated low-power display backlighting that supports ProMotion refresh rates that range from 1Hz to 120Hz. The refresh rate of the display adapts to what's happening on-screen, with lower rates used for static content and higher rates reserved for motion like games and video for a smoother, more responsive experience.\n\nAccording to an industry source cited by news aggregator account \"yeux1122\" on the Korean Naver blog, just like last year, only the Pro models in the iPhone 15 series will be equipped with the LPTO panels required for ProMotion, indicating that the feature will remain exclusive to Apple's higher-end models. From the machine-translated blog post:\n\nApple is said to have already made arrangements to deliver iPhone 15 series display panels to domestic companies, and will soon finalize details and prepare for mass production. What is confirmed here is that only the Pro Series will have a specification that supports LTPO 120 refresh rate, with the basic regular Plus model not having it in its requirements.\n\nIf accurate, unfortunately this means that the always-on display option will also remain a Pro-exclusive feature, since it is the 1Hz refresh rate capability of the updated LPTO panels that enables an idle Lock Screen to stay visible without significantly impacting battery.\n\nThe Naver blog's industry source corroborates the thinking of respected display analyst Ross Young, who in September 2022 said that while he expects Dynamic Island to feature on all iPhone 15 models, production scale constraints will likely prohibit Apple from bringing LPTO panels to the entire iPhone 15 series.\n\nAccording to Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's China-based supplier BOE, which has won orders for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, will not have production capacity for mass shipments of LTPO displays for high-end iPhones until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nOn the plus side, all iPhone 15 models will be equipped with a more power-efficient OLED display driver chip manufactured based on a 28nm process, compared to 40nm for current models, according to one report. The primary benefit of the 28nm chip would be reduced power consumption, which could contribute to longer battery life for iPhone 15 models.\n\nFor the latest rumors about the iPhone 15 lineup, read our roundups linked below.",

Almost all the iPhone models come with excellent IP ratings and can effectively shield the internal components from water damage, which allows them to withstand immersion in water to a certain extent. While no iPhone can be considered entirely waterproof, you can confidently enjoy Holi festivities without concern about damaging your smartphone.\n\nSo, from iPhone 13, iPhone 14 to iPhone SE 3, check out the 5 iPhones with the best water resistance.\n\n1. iPhone 14 Pro Max - The iPhone 14 Pro Max is IP68-rated which means it can withstand submersion in water up to a maximum depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes, according to Apple. It features a new \"Dynamic Island\" notch on a stunning 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is powered by the new A16 Bionic paired with up to 1TB storage. The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a triple camera setup with a new 48MP camera at the back.\n\n2. iPhone 14 - The iPhone 14 also comes with IP68 water resistance, making it perfect to capture your Holi celebrations with. The iPhone 14 is a minor upgrade over the iPhone 13 improving on mainly the camera and battery life over Apple's previous flagship. Apple's new Photonic Engine powered by the improved A15 Bionic chipset helps capture better quality images with more detail and colour accuracy. iPhone 14 also gets improved battery life and slightly better cameras over the iPhone 13.\n\n3. iPhone 13 - Apple's iPhone 13 is rated IP68 too meaning you can submerge in water up to 6 meters for a period of 30 minutes. iPhone 13 features a smaller notch compared to the iPhone 12. The smartphone also gets bigger sensors with Sensor Shift Stabilization which improve the camera substantially. It was also the first iPhone to feature Apple's new A15 Bionic chipset manufactured on a 5nm platform.\n\n4. iPhone 12 - Yet another IP68-rated iPhone from Apple, the iPhone 12 is an excellent companion for your Holi celebrations. It is powered by the A14 Bionic chipset which still performs at par with the best smartphones in the market today. It was the first standard iPhone variant to feature an OLED display, with Apple finally getting rid of the traditional LCD displays. The iPhone 12 underwent a major design as it arrived with a new flat design, resembling Apple's old iPhone 4S.\n\n5. iPhone SE 3 - If the above-mentioned iPhones are too pricey for you, then you can buy the iPhone SE. It is rated IP67 and can be submerged in water for up to 1 meters for a period of 30 minutes. The smartphone is powered by the same A15 Bionic processor as the iPhone 13. In terms of design and looks, the iPhone SE 3 is nearly indistinguishable to the iPhone SE 2 and the iPhone 8. The iPhone SE 3 has a single stellar camera which is capable of capturing incredible moments of your life. It is the perfect iPhone for users who want to try Apple's famous ecosystem without emptying their pockets for it.",

                    "body": "The iPhone SE 4 is seemingly up and about and is expected to launch next year. This makes room for plenty of rumors and leaks before the actual launch takes place and keeping up with tradition, we have a new one talking about the next-gen iPhone SE's display. Have a look at the details below.\n\nA recent report by The Elec hints at the biggest change Apple will introduce with the inexpensive iPhone SE 4 -- the presence of an OLED display. It is said that Apple will take BOE's help for this with an estimation of 20 million units. The display maker was earlier expected to supply panels for the 2023 iPhone 15 series but couldn't due to production issues.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 is likely to have a 6.1-inch screen, which will be a first for the SE lineup. Apple is expected to use the OLED display inventory of either the iPhone 13 or the iPhone 14 given that it would be a low-end iPhone. So, a big display with a notch is what we can expect.\n\nUp until now, the iPhone SEs have used an LCD screen of a small size, and using an OLED screen might change things for the dying iPhone lineup. With major display changes for the next iPhone SE, we can expect the phone to adopt Face ID and ditch Touch ID. Or maybe, it could integrate a side-mounted fingerprint reader, which will also be a first for Apple.\n\nThe overall design is also expected to be akin to that of the iPhone 13 but we are not too sure of what will happen. As per a recent word by Kuo, Apple has started working on the iPhone SE 4 again and it could come with its custom 5G baseband chips, thus, ditching Qualcomm's. The same could happen for the iPhone 16.\n\nWe expect a number of upgrades in the performance, battery, and camera areas but nothing concrete is available at the moment. We will keep you posted when there's more information. So, stay tuned. Also, let us know how you feel about the major changes for the iPhone SE 4 in the comments below.",

                    "body": "The launch of the iPhone SE 4 is at least a year away, and rumors/leaks surrounding the device have already started circulating. In the latest development, The ELEC claims that the fourth-generation SE model will get a BOE-manufactured OLED panel. BOE, which missed the first OLED shipment for the iPhone 15, is now working on the panels for the iPhone SE 4.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 is tipped to inherit iPhone 14's design, with rounded corners and a notch housing selfie and Face ID sensors. It will get a 6.1-inch OLED screen supplied by China-based BOE, instead of Samsung/LG displays which you will see on the iPhone 15 line-up and upcoming iPads. The display is most likely to get a 60Hz refresh rate and LTPS technology.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4's 6.1-inch LTPS OLED display will cost around $40 (nearly Rs. 3,300), less than half the price of the 6.7-inch LTPO OLED panel on the 14 Pro Max (at $100). The report claims that Apple may even use the OLED from the iPhone 13/14 models. The panel shipments for the iPhone SE 4 could be around 20 million units in 2024.\n\nBOE is developing OLED panels for the iPhone 15/15 Plus, but facing trouble processing hole displays, says The ELEC. In all likelihood, the first batch of the OLEDs for the iPhone 15 line-up will be mass-produced by Samsung/LG Display, beginning in June. BOE will produce OLEDs at least for iPhone 15/15 Plus, but they are expected to be used for repair/refurbishing works only.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 will be a low-end product that Apple will target consumers in emerging markets. In addition to an OLED panel, the device is tipped to get 12MP front and rear cameras, Apple's first-ever 5G baseband chip, and the A16 Bionic processor.",

                    "body": "Apple iPhone SE 4 will likely use OLED panels from Chinese display manufacturer BOE, a report by MacRumor suggests. According to known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has restarted development of the iPhone SE 4 smartphone, which will feature a 6.1-inch OLED display.\n\nIn a series of latest tweets, Kuo products that Apple iPhone SE will be quite similar to the standard Apple iPhone 14 that comes with a 6.1-inch OLED display with thinner bezels. For context, the current-gen Apple iPhone SE features a 4.7-inch LCD display with thicker bezels. It looks similar to Apple iPhone 8 and also sports a home button.\n\nUnder the hood, the Apple iPhone SE 4 is believed to be quite different from its predecessor. The current-gen iPhone SE uses Qualcomm's custom Snapdragon X57 chip but the upcoming SE model is believed to feature Apple's custom-designed 5G modem.\n\nDue to production problems, BOE missed the initial number of OLED panels intended for this year's iPhone 15 series, with Samsung and LG claiming the majority of orders, reports MacRumors.\n\nNow it is likely trying to make up for it by concentrating on making OLED panels for the budget-friendly iPhone SE 4.\n\nAround 20 million OLED screens are anticipated to be used in the iPhone SE 4 next year.

                    "body": "Apple iPhone 15 Plus is likely to launch later this year and the iPhone 15 line may comprise four models. ( Image Source : GSMArena )\n\nWe are months away from the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup, but according to the latest leak, the front glass panels of the upcoming phones suggest that the Apple iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max panels feature the Dynamic Island pill-shaped cutout for the selfie cam and FaceID sensors, the media has reported. The Dynamic Island was missing on last year's iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models and only the Pro models featured it.\n\nThe new leak also suggests that iPhone 15 Pro models have noticeably slimmer bezels compared to the regular iPhone 15, which is likely reusing the panels from last year's 14 Pro series, says a report by GSMArena citing a Chinese website.\n\nApple iPhone 15 Plus is likely to launch later this year and the iPhone 15 line may comprise four models, similar to what we saw in 2022. The vanilla iPhone 15 may be unveiled alongside the iPhone 15 Plus, the iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nAlso, the panels for the Pro models get a new 2.5D arc edge processing with an increased curvature, the report added.\n\nA recent report by 9to5Mac mentioned details of the CAD models for the iPhone 15 Plus, and the model is likely to adopt the Dynamic Island that was missing in last year's iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nThe iPhone 15 series is likely to sport the same display size as the iPhone 14 series. However, the iPhone 15 Pro Max model may bear the 'Ultra' moniker; Samsung also uses the Ultra moniker for its super-premium flagship Galaxy S models. CAD files are sent by Apple to accessory makers in Asia ahead of the launches of new products, with an aim to have their readied products when the new iPhone lineup is officially unveiled.\n\nThe report also added that Apple's next entire iPhone 15 lineup will have the Dynamic Island and that the notch will no longer be a \"feature\" of any current-model iPhone. The bezels are also slimmer on the iPhone 15 Plus than on the iPhone 14 Plus.\n\nAs per a previous report by 9to5Mac, there are some notable changes in the iPhone 15 Pro when compared with last year's iPhone 14 Pro and the biggest change is the swapping of Apple's Lightning port with the USB-C charging port, again based on the CAD renders. Similar to the current model, the USB-C port has been placed at the bottom, next to the bottom-firing speaker, as per the render.",

                    "body": "Apple has been reported to give the upcoming iPhone SE 4 the biggest cosmetic change after three generations. The compact design with the home button is expected to be a thing of the past, with one rumor claiming that the low-cost handset can fit inside an iPhone 14 case. Unfortunately, it might be running an older-generation chipset, but that decision would likely be made to keep the price down.\n\nThe A15 Bionic currently powers the current-generation iPhone SE, and according to @SiliconSong on Twitter, the iPhone SE 4 could be treated to the same hardware. However, one little bit of information he forgot to mention was if the A15 Bionic version used on the newer model would be the higher-binned one or not. In case you forgot, Apple introduced a higher-performing version of the SoC, which features a 5-core GPU, but that was reserved for the more expensive iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.\n\nThe same chip founds its way to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, but it should be noted that the A15 Bionic running in the iPhone SE 3 features a 4-core GPU. We believe that since the iPhone SE 4 will practically share the same design as the iPhone 14, it could share the same chipset too. On the plus side, the new low-cost model could offer a USB-C port instead of Lightning, making it less of a hassle to charge it.\n\nIt should be fairly easy for Apple to order separate quantities of USB-C ports and have them soldered to the logic board instead. As for the display, the information on Twitter mentions BOE as a supplier, which we reported about yesterday, stating that the Chinese firm will reportedly provide Apple with 20 million OLED panels for the iPhone SE 4. With the LTPS OLED panels costing $40 a unit, Apple could be paying BOE a large sum of $80 million for the entire supply.\n\nThere is also the possibility of this iPhone featuring Apple's custom 5G modem, so with the exception of the A15 Bionic, everything else looks extremely promising about the iPhone SE 4. While we would have loved to see the more powerful and efficient A16 Bionic running in this version, we understand Apple's potential move from a business perspective. In any case, we advise our readers to treat this information with a pinch of salt.",

                    "body": "Last month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the tech giant has restarted the development of the iPhone SE 4 smartphone.\n\nApple iPhone SE 4 Launch: The Cupertino-based tech giant Apple is working aggressively on its upcoming affordable iPhone SE 4, which is expected to launch in 2024. According to a new report, the company will use OLED panels from Chinese display supplier BOE for its fourth-generation iPhone SE smartphone models.\n\nDue to production problems, BOE missed the initial number of OLED panels intended for this year's iPhone 15 series, with Samsung and LG claiming the majority of orders, reports MacRumors. Now it is likely trying to make up for it by concentrating on making OLED panels for the budget-friendly iPhone SE 4.\n\nAround 20 million OLED screens are anticipated to be used in the iPhone SE 4 next year. Last month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the tech giant has restarted development of the iPhone SE 4 smartphone, which will feature a 6.1-inch OLED display and an in-house 5G baseband chip.\n\nKuo had also mentioned that the mass production of the iPhone SE 4 will go \"smoothly\" in the first half of next year. In a series of tweets, Kuo said the new iPhone SE will be similar to the standard iPhone 14, which features a 6.1-inch OLED display with thinner bezels. The current iPhone SE is equipped with a 4.7-inch LCD display with thicker bezels.\n\nAs per MacRumors, the new iPhone SE will be equipped with Apple's custom-designed 5G modem, with connectivity limited to sub-6GHz bands of 5G, the analyst said. The current iPhone SE already supports 5G but uses Qualcomm's custom Snapdragon X57 chip.\n\nThe Apple analyst did not indicate when the new iPhone SE would be released, but it likely won't be available until March 2024 or later based on when previous models of the device launched, the report added.\n\nMeanwhile, a new report has claimed that Apple is planning to launch the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in a new yellow colour option this week.",

                    "body": "Tech giant Apple is all set to unveil the iPhone 15 series, and all the models under the series, including iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, which will likely be renamed iPhone 15 Ultra, will most likely come equipped with Dynamic Island on the display panel. A new video posted by the insider ShrimpApplePro reveals what appears to be the front panel of at least three upcoming models, while it is not confirmed which panel will be for which model.\n\nMost likely, both the upcoming iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro will have 6.1-inch screens. So, even though the video has three panels, it looks like two of them are the same size. Both the iPhone 15 Plus and the iPhone 15 Pro Max should have screens that are 6.7 inches. Overall, you only need two different-sized panels. From the panels, it looks like all four models might have the cutout for the Dynamic Island display, which is already on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Plus.\n\nThe glass panels in another leaked video show that the iPhone 15 Pro series, which includes the standard pro model and pro max variation, will have smaller bezels around the display than the iPhone 14 Pro series. However, the bezels on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will be the same as those on earlier models.\n\nShrimpApplePro said earlier that the edges of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro will be curved, but the tipster made sure to explain the curves. He was clear that the iPhone 15 series would have curved edges but not curved screens. Meanwhile, a recent report indicated that the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro might feature haptic volume and power buttons instead of physical ones.",

                    "body": "In case you missed the news, there are rumors as to the next iPhone release this Spring, and it would not be a new device, but rather a refresh of the iPhone 14 with Apple releasing a new color for all. In this latest rumor, it is not yet confirmed whether Apple would have it available for the Base, Max, Pro, and Pro Max versions, but it is claimed for the 14 and 14 Plus variants.\n\nStill, this remains a rumor for its soon arrival, as there are claims that there would be a media briefing with reporters this March 7, which still has not revealed anything to the world.\n\nMark Gurman's latest tweet confirms yet another rumor that a new color is coming for the iPhone 14 this Spring, and it will arrive at the same time as last year's announcement of the latest Green iPhone 13 release. Gurman claimed that this new color release is \"imminent,\" and it highly puts attention on the upcoming color update to the smartphone.\n\nThis new iPhone 14 color would center on the yellow color, and this release was last seen from Apple's 2019 lineup of the iPhone 11.\n\nThe iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 dropped the yellow smartphone color on their base models for unknown reasons.\n\nAccording to MacRumors, there were also rumors regarding Apple holding a product briefing for this new colorway of the iPhone 14, coming this March 7, but there are no announcements yet as of this writing.\n\nRead Also: Apple iPhone 14, Android Phone Battery Boost Hack: How to Restrict Background Data/Refresh\n\nShould there be a new iPhone 14 color, it would be in time for the company as it's last year's midway release of the Alpine Green for the iPhone 13, a release that nobody anticipated from the company.\n\nWhile there are no enhancements to its internals, features, and the like, this gives a refresh to the smartphone that will further fit a person's wants and preferences for its external look.\n\nApple brought new and bold colors to its iPhone lineup since the release of the XR but only continued it for the base models of the iPhone. Back in 2019, Apple revealed the iPhone 11 to the world, along with its playful and bright color schemes for the base models of the device, all in all getting six colorways to choose from the lineup.\n\nThe iPhone 12 delivered also bold and exciting colors for the device, and this went on for Apple, putting them at a top spot for people showcasing their smartphones to the world, in different hues to express their selves.\n\nThis went on for the iPhone 13, but Apple delivered a new color for the public to enjoy halfway towards its release, with the Alpine Green debuting months later in 2022.\n\nThe current leak on the iPhone 14 is massive, but this only centers on the base versions of the smartphone lineup, and not exactly on its Pro variants. Still, this would be a great change if one wants the Yellow color scheme for their smartphone, and this may be what the iPhone 14 needs for its pop of excitement, like holding sunshine on one's hand.",

                    "title": "Apple iPhone SE 4 next year to feature BOE-supplied OLED panel: Check details here",
                    "body": "Apple will use OLED panels from Chinese display supplier BOE in its upcoming fourth-generation iPhone SE smartphone models, the media reported. Due to production problems, BOE missed the initial number of OLED panels intended for this year's iPhone 15 series, with Samsung and LG claiming the majority of orders, reports MacRumors.\n\nNow it is likely trying to make up for it by concentrating on making OLED panels for the budget-friendly iPhone SE 4. Around 20 million OLED screens are anticipated to be used in the iPhone SE 4 next year.\n\nLast month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the tech giant has restarted development of the iPhone SE 4 smartphone, which will feature a 6.1-inch OLED display and an in-house 5G baseband chip. Kuo also mentioned that the mass production of the iPhone SE 4 will go \"smoothly\" in the first half of next year.\n\nApple had already launched a 5G iPhone SE the last time, but the next one is likely to use the company's in-house G baseband chip. This chip is reportedly built using a 4nm process and supports only sub-6GHz. This could be the first iPhone model to use that chip, which has been in development for years, and Apple deciding to use it on an entry-level iPhone would mean a dry run for the chip before it makes its way to flagship iPhones.\n\nApple's premium-range iPhone models still use Qualcomm's modem chips for 5G. Previous reports have suggested Apple would begin using its own 5G modems in the coming years, but due to some complexity, Apple has refrained from replacing the Qualcomm modems with the in-house ones. Even if what Kuo has said holds any water, it still does not offer clarity as to whether or not the iPhone models in 2024 would come with Apple's own 5G modems. That is because the modems do not currently support mmWave and satellite communications -- two of the most advanced features of the iPhone.\n\nPublished Date: March 7, 2023 11:43 AM IST For the latest tech news across the world, latest PC and Mobile games, tips & tricks, top-notch gadget reviews of most exciting releases follow Techlusive India's Facebook, Twitter, subscribe our YouTube Channel.

The Cupertino giant is yet to delve into details about the purported next generation of iPhone SE but a new report suggests that the upcoming device will use an OLED (organic light emitting diode) display from China-based BOE (Beijing Oriental Electronics). The current iPhone SE models feature LG and Samsung displays with LCD screens. The iPhone SE 4 is tipped to make its debut next year. Apple has so far launched three generations of its budget iPhone SE model.\n\nAccording to a report by The Elec (in Korean), BOE will supply 6.1-inch OLED screens for the low-end iPhone SE (2022) successor, which is expected to be released next year. The Chinese manufacturer failed to deliver the initial batch of screens for the iPhone 15, and display units for the iPhone 15 units will be procured from LG and Samsung as per the report, which adds that OLED panel shipments for the iPhone SE 4 are estimated to be around 20 million next year.\n\nThe price of the OLED screen of the 6.1-inch iPhone SE 4 could be around $40 (roughly Rs. 3,200), according to the report. This is less than half of the LTPO OLED panel used in the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max which costs around $100 (roughly Rs. 8,100).\n\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently suggested that the new iPhone SE will be similar to the standard iPhone 14. It is also tipped to include Apple's 5G baseband chip manufactured using a 4nm process.\n\nApple announced the third iteration of its iPhone SE last year in March. The iPhone SE (2022) was launched at a starting price tag of Rs. 43,900 for the base 64GB model.\n\nThe iPhone SE (2022) is powered by Apple's A15 Bionic SoC and sports a 4.7-inch Retina HD display. It has a single 12-megapixel camera sensor at the back. For selfies and video chats, it has a 7-megapixel camera sensor at the front.",

                    "body": "The phone itself was predicted by an analyst to be a modified iPhone 14.\n\nApple announced the third iteration of its iPhone SE last year, and rumours about a fourth have already started to surface. These rumours paint a picture of the iPhone SE 4 seeing a 2024 release. Adding to that is the claim that these phones by the fruit company will be using OLED screens by a Chinese display maker, Beijing Oriental Electronics (BOE), rather than the usual suspects Samsung or LG.\n\nSouth Korean news outlet The Elec reports that BOE is expected to supply the 6.1-inch OLED displays that will be equipped on the iPhone SE 4. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously made the prediction that the more budget-friendly device will be a \"minor modification\" of the iPhone 14. Which is fitting in its own way, as the BOE previously supplied Apple with screens for last year's line of phones. This likely translates to lower costs for both companies in the production process for the iPhone SE 4.\n\nThe report also noted that BOE failed to deliver the initial batch of screens for the iPhone 15 that met Apple's demands. While the company did manage to sort things out, its displays will reportedly only be used for repairs that the phoned may need during its lifespan. On the other hand, display giants Samsung and LG will be the ones to provide the screens that will be attached to the new phones when they hit shelves.\n\nOn the subject of screens, Bloomberg reported earlier this year that Apple is working on being able to produce its own displays for its products. These will feature what is called microLEDs, and are expected to show up as early as 2024. Though the company is thought to be starting small first, literally, as it rolls out its own screens on smaller products like the high end Apple Watches, namely the Ultra variant.",

                    "body": "MacRumors also revealed that Apple's PR team is planning a product briefing with reporters this Tuesday, March 7.\n\nApple may launch its latest iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in a new yellow colour option this week. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman took to micro-blogging site Twitter and said \"a new iPhone 14 color is indeed imminent\".\n\n\"Nearly a year to the day after the announcement of the green iPhone 13, a new iPhone 14 color is indeed imminent,\" he wrote. A report from MacRumors also revealed that Apple's PR team is planning a product briefing with reporters this Tuesday, March 7, which could be related to the launch of a new iPhone colour.\n\nThe US-based tech giant may announce the new iPhone 14 colour option with a press release on the Apple Newsroom website, potentially alongside the introduction of new iPhone case and Apple Watch band colours for the spring, the report said.\n\nThe brand last offered a Yellow color option for the iPhone 11 in 2019 and the iPhone XR in 2018. It's unclear if Apple is planning a new colour for the iPhone 14 Pro models, but Yellow might be similar to the current Gold option for those devices.\n\nThe Cupertino-based company announced new Green colours for the iPhone 13 series on March 8 last year, so there is a chance the briefing is related to a new iPhone colour being announced. The US-based tech giant often adds new iPhone colours in the spring to boost sales midway through the product cycle.\n\nLast March, Apple introduced a new Green color for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, and a new Alpine Green colour for the iPhone 13 Pro models. In April 2021, Apple made the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini available in Purple.\n\nIn related news, according to 9to5Mac sources, Apple is also planning to release an updated version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M3 chip. The unannounced M3 chip will have an 8-core CPU like the M2 chip. The report doesn't indicate when the trio of MacBooks will be announced.",

                    "body": "Apple has had quite a busy start to the year, and it looks like during March they won't be stepping on the brakes. According to Mark Gurmanjournalist for Bloomberg and one of the most reliable sources when it comes to future Apple products, the company will introduce a new color for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus this week..\n\nInterestingly, this is not the first time we hear these rumors. Just a few days ago, a publication on Weibo, the Chinese social network, advanced that the iPhone 14 will be available in. yellow. However, because the person responsible for the information had no prior history of leaks, few paid attention to it.\n\nIt is worth mentioning, however, that this time the Pro variant would be left with no new features. The yellow color would be introduced, only, for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.\n\nMark Gurman is not the only one who gives validity to the information. MacRumors notes that, according to sources close to Apple's public relations team, the company will hold a private event on March 7 with members of the press to make the official announcement. Please note, the above information is not 100% confirmed, so it is best to take it with a grain of salt. In any case, any doubts will be resolved in a matter of hours.\n\nAn important point to highlight is that, in the past, Apple has already taken advantage of the mid-cycle of an iPhone generation to launch a new color. We should remember that, during March 2022, they introduced the iPhone 13 Pro in alpine green, and the iPhone 13 in green. A year earlier, the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini embraced the purple color.\n\n\ud83d\udc49You might appreciate Square launches support for Apple Tap to Pay\n\nThis strategy, evidently, allows them to boost sales of the terminal again. It is well known that the iPhone, in the last fiscal quarter, had rather disappointing numbers. As explained by Apple, the low sales of the smartphone were caused by an environment full of challenges. For example, they again faced several problems in the Asian production line.\n\nYellow iPhone 14, imagined by 'MacRumors'.\n\nTherefore, offering the iPhone 14 in yellow could generate interest among those people who, despite being willing to renew their terminal, are in no hurry to do so when a generation is just debuting on the market. Let's not forget that the iPhone 14 family has already been around for half a year, so enough time has passed for consumers to plan their purchase.\n\nLikewise, it's curious that in the midst of rumors about a new color for the iPhone 14, there is so much speculation about the successor generation. There is talk that the iPhone 15 will boast a completely revamped designembracing those rounded corners we saw a few years ago on the iPhone 5c.\n\nPerhaps the feature that generates the most morbidity, however, is the arrival, at long last, of the USB-C connector to the entire range. Apple will have to align to European regulations to avoid exemplary sanctions, and that means saying goodbye once and for all to the Lighning port. If those led by Tim Cook follow the schedule of previous years, the iPhone 15 will be unveiled sometime in September.",

That launch took place on March 8, last year.\n\nThis time around, the new hue (yellow in this case) might arrive a day earlier, as multiple sources have talked about a product briefing taking place with Apple's PR team on the matter tomorrow, on March 7. Now Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is confirming that a new iPhone 14 color is, in his words, \"imminent\".\n\nGurman has been reporting on Apple-related stuff for years, and is generally regarded to be among the most trustworthy sources in the scene, so while this obviously isn't official confirmation from Apple - at least not yet - it's probably the closest we'll get up until the moment when the company decides to issue a press release for the new color and make it available for purchase.\n\nAccording to other sources, the press release announcing the yellow variation of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will drop either tomorrow or the day after. So stick around, as it seems like we're getting a shiny new iPhone hue to look at very soon.",

It's not clear if Apple will be holding an event this year, but the rumors suggest this new model will release without an event.\n\nIt's not clear whether Apple will release a version of the new iPhone in both standard and Pro varieties or how dark or bright the hue will be. Apple has previously released three yellow iPhones -- the iPhone XR, iPhone 11, and the iPhone 5c -- all of which were bright. Apple has never released an iPhone Pro in yellow, though since that model generally has subtler shades, so it could be closer to a pale yellow.\n\nApple has several new products rumored to release over the coming months, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, Apple silicon-based Mac Pro, and its long-awaited Reality Pro headset. However, there aren't any rumors that any of those products will arrive alongside the new iPhone color.",

                    "body": "AppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\n\nRumors recently surfaced about a possible yellow iPhone 14 being announced soon, and leaker Mark Gurman corroborates this, calling a new color launch \"imminent.\"\n\nApple launched the green iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro on March 8, 2022 -- almost exactly one year ago. Since Apple tends to operate on a relatively clockwork schedule, this has led to speculation about another spring color update.\n\nAccurate leaker and Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman has said as much via a tweet. He states that nearly a year after the iPhone 13 color update, a new iPhone 14 color is imminent.\n\nThat isn't too specific, but given the source, it provides a lot more weight behind a Weibo post about an impending yellow iPhone launch. This is also corroborated by information obtained by MacRumors that suggests a press briefing would take place sometime this week.\n\nThere isn't any indication if Apple will reveal a new color for both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro. The company generally reserves brighter colors for its non-pro devices, and a muted yellow likely wouldn't differentiate enough from the existing gold option for the iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nApple tends to release a new color way for its existing iPhone lineup in the spring. This provides a sales boost during what has historically been a weaker quarter for iPhone.",

This comes after a sketchier leak posted to Weibo last week said a new color would be released sometime this year.\n\nLast week's rumor said the iPhone 14 will soon launch in a new yellow color option. Gurman doesn't address what color Apple is planning, but rather just that a \"new iPhone 14 color is indeed imminent.\"\n\nApple announced new green iPhone 13 and alpine green iPhone 13 Pro color options last year on March 8. In 2021, the special spring purple edition iPhone 12 was announced on April 20.\n\nLast year, Apple held a special event in early March to announce the Mac Studio, Studio Display, and more. This year, we're expecting March announcements to be press releases -- perhaps with shorter event-style keynote videos released simultaneously.\n\nThe last time Apple offered a yellow model was with the iPhone 11. At this point, it's unclear whether both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will get a new yellow option. It's possible only the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are updated since the iPhone 14 Pro is already available in gold.\n\nWhat do you think of the rumored iPhone 14 in yellow? Let us know down in the comments.",

It will use a 6.1-inch LTPS (low-temperature polycrystalline silicon) TFT (thin film transistor) display, which is easier to produce than the LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) panels on the Pro models.\n\nThe part is rumored to cost around $40, more than twice less than the $100 displays for the Pro models.",

                    "body": "The iPhone 15 Pro is expected to arrive later this year with significant changes to the exterior of Apple's flagship product, including redesigned buttons. Early reports from supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggest Apple is switching to haptic buttons on the new iPhones. Further details from 9to5Mac have added more fuel to the fire: the traditional volume buttons and mute switch are not long for this world.\n\nApple's had tremendous success moving from physical buttons and touchpads that click to solid-state ones that use vibrations to recreate the sensation of clicking, so whatever it does for the iPhone 15 Pro, there's little reason to be concerned. But the layout of the iPhone's buttons is downright sacred to some, and changing it shouldn't come without some advantage.\n\nAccording to 9to5Mac, the iPhone 15 Pros are moving from separate volume buttons to something more akin to a volume rocker, like Apple included on the first-generation iPhone and iPad. Because of the proposed placement of one or more Taptic Engines (Apple's method for creating haptic feedback), the singular button could generate separate and distinct \"clicks\" but would be a single surface.\n\nThe mute switch, meanwhile, will stop being a switch entirely and instead work as a smaller button that can be pressed \"harder\" (Apple might call this a \"force press\") to mute or unmute your iPhone. How well any of these buttons will hold up to accidental presses from a tight pair of pants, case, or running armband remains to be seen, but if the company's solid-state home buttons are any indication, they should be just as sensitive.\n\nApple's been a holdout; most flagship phones, like Samsung's Galaxy S23 Ultra, have wholly abandoned a standalone hardware switch for silencing your phone. Even OnePlus, long known for its alert slider, gave up the hardware switch on the OnePlus 10T, only to bring it back on the OnePlus 11 after users demanded it. Apple could be setting itself up for a similar knee-jerk reaction by changing how the volume button and mute switch work on the iPhone 15.\n\nBut change is also an opportunity to try something new. What if Apple leaned into the volume button and mute switch being different and actually added functionality? Asus' Zenfone 9 feels like a great phone to take inspiration from. On the Zenfone 9, Asus included a touch-sensitive fingerprint reader that also acts as a swipeable surface for pulling down the notification tray, reloading websites, and more. Apple could let the surface of the new unified volume button work in the same way as another method for interacting with iOS on the iPhone 15 Pro, much like the digital crown is for watchOS on Apple Watches.\n\nA jog dial-esque interaction would keep the screen free from your fingers and let you do more things on your iPhone one-handed, two big wins as iPhones get progressively larger. Or what if the the volume rocker can act as one big button, like for the camera app? These are all possible ideas, but one thing that might be a reason for concern: gloves. Haptic buttons, like the solid-state Touch ID button currently in the iPhone SE 3, do not work with gloves.\n\nWe won't know how these new buttons will work until later this year, but considering Apple seems interested in reinterpreting fundamental aspects of the iPhone's design, why not start with the controls we touch most often?",

                    "body": "March 6 replace under. This submit was first revealed on March 3, 2023.\n\nApple launched its iPhone 14 sequence final September, however there could also be a brand-new addition to the vary in a matter of days. If the rumors are true, it's probably that there will probably be a brand new shade added for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. And the colour? Yellow.\n\nMarch 6 replace. Whereas we wait till the potential announcement of a brand new iPhone 14, a brand new leak has appeared. Picked up by Joe Rossignol at MacRumors, it provides gasoline to the fireplace that one thing is coming, and shortly. A Twitter account, Majin Bu, has simply claimed to have proof of latest circumstances for the iPhone 14 Professional and iPhone 14 Professional Max.\n\nIn response to the leak, there will probably be two new leather-based case colours, Deep Violet and Golden Brown, so as to add to the prevailing shades.\n\nAs you'll learn under, there's no expectation of a brand new iPhone 14 Professional within the quick future, however the truth that new case colours are being touted is encouraging: Apple likes to launch all its Spring updates on the identical time. Often, these contain iPhone circumstances, Watch straps and a new-color iPhone. So, the sight of those circumstances, assuming the leak is real, means that new merchandise are coming quickly.\n\nAnd the leaker in query has a blended however first rate observe document in predicting the arrival of circumstances up to now, in order that's good.\n\nApple typically has different new-color updates for Spring, akin to luscious new Watch bands, as an example. Will these characteristic on the identical time? Maybe there'll be a sunshine yellow Watch band to go together with the cellphone.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAssuming the rumors and leaks tie in with one another, we might know extra within the subsequent couple of days. Apple's Spring releases are at all times price a glance, and they're particularly attractive for these individuals who wished to purchase a brand new iPhone again in September however weren't out of contract in time, as an example. An iPhone in a brand new shade has the extra standing of interesting to those that need the very newest, latest possibility.\n\nWhereas mid-season additions to the iPhone vary are nothing new, Apple has stored this iPhone beneath exceptionally tight wraps, so the most recent rumors have shocked many.\n\nA report in a Weibo submit that was picked up by the Japanese weblog Mac Otakara has recommended that subsequent week might see the debut of the brand new yellow iPhones.\n\nSo, how probably is that this rumor to be true? Effectively, it's exhausting to know if the Weibo account has any type of observe document, in order that's not a fantastic begin.\n\nAlternatively, the timing is fairly plausible. Final yr, on March 8, Apple introduced a brand new inexperienced model of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, plus alpine inexperienced for iPhone 13 Professional and iPhone 13 Professional Max. And MacRumors is reporting that it has been knowledgeable of a product briefing by Apple on Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd can there be a yellow Apple iPhone 14 Professional? My guess is not any. The Professional telephones are inclined to have extra muted colours, and who needs a muted yellow? The enjoyment of yellow is its vivid, gaudy brilliance. And yellow is maybe a bit near the gold that's at present within the iPhone 14 Professional assortment of colours.\n\nYellow is, alternatively, a staple of the iPhone vary. Together with iPhone 5c and iPhone XR, there was a yellow iPhone 11. Oh, and though Apple has by no means launched a yellow iPhone within the Spring earlier than, it's the quintessential shade for the season, absolutely, as darkish days give approach to the delights of extra sunshine.\n\nFact is, there's not a lot to go on right here, although the timing appears extremely credible.\n\nApple's mid-season shade addition has develop into one thing of a practice. Earlier than final yr's inexperienced and alpine inexperienced, a purple iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini had been added in 2021 -- although a contact later, in April. Why was it late? Effectively, the iPhone 12 sequence was introduced late as effectively, in October 2021, because of Covid disruption.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo, the prospect of a brand new iPhone being introduced subsequent Tuesday is intriguing. We might not know a lot now, however the excellent news is there's not lengthy to attend.",

                    "body": "It is hardly a secret that Apple is not paying much attention to its less-premium iPhones. Even this year's vanilla iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus (both of which command rather steep price tags) feel like a bit of a rip off.\n\nThat is until you take a look at the entry-level option in Apple's iPhone portfolio: the iPhone SE 3 (2022). Despite the latter being a capable device under the hood, one thing cannot be denied - these bezels are unacceptable in 2033, especially when you are paying upwards of $400 for a smartphone.\n\nLuckily, this will be the first thing Apple will be changing in 2024 with the iPhone SE 4. According to a report by The Elec, which was subsequently covered by MacRumors in a dedicated article, the Cupertino company will be using a 6.1-inch OLED display for its upcoming budget iPhone.\n\nThe panel will be supplied by China's BOE and will reportedly be identical to the one found on the vanilla iPhone 13 model. Given the fact that the iPhone SE 4 will use components from older devices, it is possible that it will retain a lower price point.\n\nHowever, in light of the fact that this will be the most significant upgrade to the lineup in almost a decade, a price hike is likely. It should be noted that the design of the iPhone SE 4 is not the only aspect of the device being brought in line with industry standards.\n\nThis will be the first budget iPhone to ditch the LCD display in favor of an OLED one. This, coupled with the more modern look, could tempt many users that are unwilling to splurge on Apple's ultra-premium iPhones.\n\nThe iPhone SE (2022) is still probably one of, if not the best cheap iPhone you can buy in 2023. But it is set to become so much better.",

Incidentally, a patent for this technology was discovered earlier this year. In theory, a large Taptic button will send a volume up/down command to iOS, depending on where you press it.\n\nThe same will apply to the mute switch, which has been a mainstay of iPhones since the inaugural model that Apple introduced in 2007. 9to5Mac does not mention Apple including a solid-state power button though, which would be an odd omission when pivoting away from physical parts. As it stands, it appears that Apple has reserved these changes for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, with the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus retaining physical buttons.",

                    "body": "March 6 update below. This post was first published on March 3, 2023.\n\nApple launched its iPhone 14 series last September, but there may be a brand-new addition to the range in a matter of days. If the rumors are true, it's likely that there will be a new color added for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. And the color? Yellow.\n\nMarch 6 update. While we wait until the possible announcement of a new iPhone 14, a new leak has appeared. Picked up by Joe Rossignol at MacRumors, it adds fuel to the fire that something is coming, and soon. A Twitter account, Majin Bu, has just claimed to have evidence of new cases for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nAccording to the leak, there will be two new leather case colors, Deep Violet and Golden Brown, to add to the existing shades.\n\nAs you'll read below, there's no expectation of a new iPhone 14 Pro in the immediate future, but the fact that new case colors are being touted is encouraging: Apple likes to release all its Spring updates at the same time. Usually, these involve iPhone cases, Watch straps and a new-color iPhone. So, the sight of these cases, assuming the leak is genuine, suggests that new products are coming soon.\n\nAnd the leaker in question has a mixed but decent track record in predicting the arrival of cases in the past, so that's good.\n\nApple often has other new-color updates for Spring, such as luscious new Watch bands, for instance. Will these feature at the same time? Perhaps there'll be a sunshine yellow Watch band to go with the phone.\n\nAssuming the rumors and leaks tie in with each other, we could know more in the next couple of days. Apple's Spring releases are always worth a look, and they are especially enticing for those people who wanted to buy a new iPhone back in September but weren't out of contract in time, for instance. An iPhone in a new color has the additional status of appealing to those who want the very latest, newest option.\n\nWhile mid-season additions to the iPhone range are nothing new, Apple has kept this iPhone under exceptionally tight wraps, so the latest rumors have surprised many.\n\nA report in a Weibo post that was picked up by the Japanese blog Mac Otakara has suggested that next week could see the debut of the new yellow iPhones.\n\nSo, how likely is this rumor to be true? Well, it's hard to know if the Weibo account has any kind of track record, so that's not a great start.\n\nOn the other hand, the timing is pretty believable. Last year, on March 8, Apple announced a new green version of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, plus alpine green for iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. And MacRumors is reporting that it has been informed of a product briefing by Apple on Tuesday.\n\nAnd will there be a yellow Apple iPhone 14 Pro? My guess is no. The Pro phones tend to have more muted colors, and who wants a muted yellow? The joy of yellow is its bright, gaudy brilliance. And yellow is perhaps a bit close to the gold that's currently in the iPhone 14 Pro collection of colors.\n\nYellow is, on the other hand, a staple of the iPhone range. Along with iPhone 5c and iPhone XR, there was a yellow iPhone 11. Oh, and although Apple has never launched a yellow iPhone in the Spring before, it's the quintessential color for the season, surely, as dark days give way to the delights of more sunshine.\n\nTruth is, there's not much to go on here, though the timing seems highly credible.\n\nApple's mid-season color addition has become something of a tradition. Before last year's green and alpine green, a purple iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini were added in 2021 -- though a touch later, in April. Why was it late? Well, the iPhone 12 series was announced late as well, in October 2021, thanks to Covid disruption.\n\nSo, the prospect of a new iPhone being announced next Tuesday is intriguing. We may not know much now, but the good news is there's not long to wait.",

If you click on a link in this story we may earn affiliate revenue.\n\nWe've just spotted a ridiculously cheap iPhone plan that's proving popular with shoppers.\n\nYou can pick up a refurbished Apple iPhone XS from O2 for \u00a317 per month and \u00a30 upfront.\n\nAt the time of writing, a caption on the Mobile Phones Direct website states that '55 [iPhone XS have been] sold in the last few days.'\n\nClearly, despite its six-year vintage, the iPhone XS is a handset that's still incredibly popular with buyers.\n\nThis is a refurbished model that's marked as 'as new', and O2 has doubled the data allowance from 5GB to 10GB.\n\nDon't forget that the iPhone X line marked the generation when Apple gave its smartphones a huge redesign - so the XS is still what you'd call a contemporary-looking iPhone.\n\nIt's got Face ID rather than Touch ID, the controversial sensor 'notch' that was introduced with the X, plus a large and bezel-free display.\n\nThe iPhone XS is all but identical to the iPhone X, but has a more powerful chipset inside.\n\nProduction ceased on this smartphone back in 2018, so the only way to get hold of it now is by going the refurbished route.\n\nAt a time when the cost of living crisis is turning many shoppers away from flashy high-end smartphones, this ultra-cheap O2 contract is a great budget option.\n\nIt's also a smart choice for kids who refuse to have any phone without an Apple logo.\n\nThis isn't the only great offer on a refurb iPhone we've seen lately - last week, we reported on a fantastic discount being offered by Amazon on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.\n\nWe regularly report on great-value phone contracts from the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google - head to our tech deals hub to see the latest offers.",

There's even a suggestion as to what names they will be given- 'Golden Brown' and 'Deep Violet'.\n\nIt's not unusual for Apple to introduce new color cases every now and then, and the Twitter user is known for accurate leaks, which include the iPhone 13 refreshed case colors, among others. The user said that the brown and violet-purple leather cases will be part of the iPhone 14 'spring collection', but did not offer any other details aside from the images.

                    "body": "BOE is expected to supply 6.1-inch OLED display panels for the rumored iPhone SE 4, reports The Elec.\n\nAccording to the industry on the 3rd, BOE is expected to supply 6.1-inch organic light emitting diode (OLED) for the low-end iPhone SE4, which is expected to be released next year. The iPhone SE series has so far only been released as a liquid crystal display (LCD) model, but next year's model is likely to be applied with OLED.\n\nThe Elec also notes that Samsung and LG Display are less interested in competing to supply panels for the iPhone SE 4 as its panel will cost less than half that of the panel used on iPhone Pro Max models.\n\nSince the OLED for iPhone SE4 is a panel for legacy models and a low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) thin film transistor (TFT) product with low technical difficulty, Samsung Display and LG Display are less interested in the model. The price of OLED for the 6.1-inch iPhone SE4 is currently estimated to be around $40. Compared to the price of OLED for the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max, which uses low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) thin film transistor (TFT), it costs well over $100, $40 is less than half. It is known that the price of LTPO method OLED is twice that of LTPS method OLED of the same size.\n\nLast month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo revealed that Apple had restarted development of a new iPhone SE 4 that will likely feature a 6.1-inch OLED display and Apple's long awaited in-house 5G modem. The baseband chip will reportedly be produced on a 4nm process and only support Sub-6GHz networks.\n\nPlease download the iClarified app or follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and RSS for more iPhone SE 4 updates.",

                    "body": "This iPhone 15 Pro Max design render is UNLIKE anything you have seen before\n\nWhen iPhone 14 launched back in 2022, many Apple fans were disheartened by the design as it looked exactly like iPhone 13. However, the upper-end models - iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max - were a little different as they had the new Dynamic Island, while the non-Pro models had the classic notch design. Now, the latest leak suggests that iPhone 15 series is set to change! Apple Track has shared the first video of the front display panels of the iPhone 15 in a tweet. It suggests the appearance of Dynamic Island on the non-Pro iPhone 15 models this year. Impressed? Nobody is exactly blowing their trumpets over it, but as things stand in the wake of the Covid contagion, that is a massive makeover. And the rest of the design? The jury is still out on whether that will change, or not.\n\nThis will bring a major change in the iPhone 15 display panel design from the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 series. Dynamic Island is basically an i-shaped cutout which features a selfie camera and Face-ID sensor. Moreover, you can check alerts and current activity in progress -- such as music that's playing, your timer, an AirDrop connection and directions from Maps -- in the Dynamic Island on the Home Screen or in any app.\n\nNot just that, several previous reports suggest that the entire iPhone 15 series will bring a USB-C charging port while ditching the current Lightning port. Moreover, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are tipped to get an upgrade of the A16 Bionic chipset, while the Pro models will be equipped with a new A17 Bionic chipset. What else?\n\nYou can expect a major camera upgrade as the non-Pro iPhone 15 models will bring three-stacked sensors with a 48MP wide lens for the first time. So far, the 48MP camera is exclusively for iPhone 14 Pro models, a previous leak by analyst Jeff Pu of Haitong Intl Tech Research suggested.\n\nApart from this, Apple Tracker has also revealed that new MacBook Air laptops are rumoured to launch between Spring and Summer. Moreover, Apple is also tipped to be working on a new iMax, which is expected to be equipped with the M3 chip and should be released sometime in the second half of 2023.",

                    "body": "The iPhone 14 Pro Max is -- without a doubt -- an incredible smartphone. It's easily one of the best phones you can buy in 2023, touting hardware and software that are nearly perfect on every level. It's the phone I've carried with me every day since it launched last October, but after living with it for about five months, I'm worried I made a big mistake in choosing it to be my primary iPhone.\n\nContents My biggest issue with the iPhone 14 Pro MaxOther big phones do it betterDowngrading to the regular iPhone 14 Pro\n\nThere's nothing wrong or bad about the iPhone 14 Pro Max. It's the most capable and technically impressive iPhone currently on the market. But even with that being the case, I can't use it anymore -- and I'm moving on to something else.\n\nMy biggest issue with the iPhone 14 Pro Max\n\nPrior to getting the iPhone 14 Pro Max, one of my biggest reservations was the phone's gargantuan size. At the time, Digital Trends' Andy Boxall talked about how the large footprint was one of the main things that stopped him from getting an iPhone 14 Pro Max in the first place. But unlike Andy, I threw caution to the wind and went the Pro Max route anyway. I said to myself: \"The size won't be a problem! I'll get used to it just fine!\" That's what I naively talked myself into believing anyway.\n\nRelated The best smartwatches and wearables of MWC 2023 The Motorola Rizr shows why rollable phones are still a terrible idea Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: the 7 biggest things I want to see\n\nBut as the weeks and months progressed, I gradually found neither of those things to be true.\n\nThere wasn't one single tipping point in which the iPhone 14 Pro Max's size became too much to handle, but rather a lot of little things I've had to deal with along the way. If I'm typing long messages on the keyboard, I have to rest the iPhone 14 Pro Max on a table or pillow. If I sit down with the phone in my front pocket, the top half pops out and jabs me in my waist.\n\nAnd any kind of one-handed use is guaranteed to be awkward. It's not impossible, but it always requires advanced hand gymnastics that are uncomfortable and put the iPhone 14 Pro Max in danger of being dropped. As much as I appreciate the added screen size and long battery life, I often feel like I'm begrudgingly putting up with the iPhone 14 Pro Max to get those things, rather than simply enjoying them.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max's size was far from a surprise going into it; I knew the phone was big and bulky. And while I prefer smaller phones, I don't mind using other large Android phones. I've used the Pixel 7 Pro, OnePlus 11, and Galaxy S23 Plus -- all big phones -- without their size being a nagging issue. So, what about the iPhone 14 Pro Max really did me in?\n\nFor one thing, it's markedly heavier than any of those other phones mentioned above. Compared to the 212-gram, 205g, and 196g weights of those three Android phones, respectively, the iPhone 14 Pro Max clocks in at a hefty 240g. And that's despite its height and width being within 3 millimeters of its Pixel, OnePlus, and Galaxy competition.\n\nIt's one thing to look at those numbers on a spec sheet online, but it's another thing entirely when you're actually lugging around a 240g smartphone with you on a daily basis.\n\nOther big phones do it better\n\nCombined with my growing frustration with the iPhone 14 Pro Max's awkward size, things really came to a head when I got the Galaxy S23 Ultra last month. The S23 Ultra really isn't smaller than the iPhone 14 Pro Max -- weighing a hefty 234g and measuring a couple of millimeters taller and wider. But I've found myself enjoying it more than the iPhone.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this is the in-hand feel. Along with being a few grams lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the Galaxy S23 Ultra has a rounded frame compared to the totally flat design of the iPhone. It's a subtle difference, but it's one that allows the S23 Ultra to feel more ergonomic and comfortable to hold. I never feel like I have a great grip on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, and when you add that with the sharp edges of its flat frame, the end result is a phone that's mighty tricky to wrangle -- especially compared side by side with the S23 Ultra.\n\nBut it's not just a weight and design thing. Samsung also does more with the Galaxy S23 Ultra's size than Apple does. Compared to the smaller S23 and S23 Plus, the S23 Ultra gives you a vastly superior camera system, a gigantic battery, faster charging, more storage, and even a built-in S Pen stylus.\n\nWhat am I getting with the iPhone 14 Pro Max that I couldn't get with the regular iPhone 14 Pro? A larger display and a bigger battery. But that's it. The camera, charging, storage, and other specs are identical. That creates a strong argument in favor of the smaller iPhone 14 Pro, while making it harder to justify why I'm still using the 14 Pro Max.\n\nDowngrading to the regular iPhone 14 Pro\n\nIt's because of those reasons that I switched from the iPhone 14 Pro Max to the iPhone 14 Pro a couple of weeks ago. And you know what? I'm really glad that I did. It's just as fast, the camera experience is identical, all of my apps work the same, and the Dynamic Island is still there ... for better or worse.\n\nThe best part? I get that same experience on a phone I can use without constantly thinking about how heavy or bulky it is. I can use the iPhone 14 Pro one-handed, throw it in a tight pocket with ease, and type without a pillow to prop it up on -- it's great.\n\nIt hasn't been a perfect experience, though. Battery life is noticeably worse than on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, and I'm regularly looking for a charger by late afternoon. It's a big sticking point, and why I still think the iPhone 14 Pro Max is the better iPhone for folks who can stomach the price and size.\n\nBut if you're like me and are hypersensitive toward the latter, I'd suggest opting for the regular iPhone 14 Pro if you're torn between the two. I know I'm glad I finally did, and it's the iPhone I'll keep rocking for the foreseeable future -- until it's time for the iPhone 15, that is.\n\nToday's tech news, curated and condensed for your inbox Subscribe Check your inbox!

                    "body": "The iPhone 15 series might be getting thinner display bezels and Dynamic Islands all around, if parts that recently leaked from China are an indicator.\n\nPurported videos of the iPhone 15 front glass panels were leaked on Bilibili and then by ShrimpApplePro on Twitter, with the latter stating that their source had confirmed the authenticity of the parts. The video seems to show off markedly thinner bezels for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, or about 0.5 mm less than the previous generation. While it doesn't seem the iPhone 15 base and Plus models will get the same treatment, the entire lineup could see a slight curve around the display edges, in alignment with the rumor that the back edges will also be rounded, a la current gen MacBook Pro 14 and 16.\n\nFrom the leak, it also seems like the Dynamic Island will be adopted by all four iPhone 15 models. Presently, the feature is locked to the iPhone 14 Pro only. What may be limited to the iPhone 15 Pro this time, however, is a move from a stainless steel chassis to a titanium one, plus a return of unified, single-piece volume rockers and mute button paired with dedicated haptic feedback for each.\n\nRegardless of whether these changes make it to production, it's interesting that Cupertino is drawing from older models for design inspiration, in the context of the curved display and unified buttons. Curved displays were used on the iPhone 11, while an older version of unified buttons were last seen on the iPhone 3G/GS.\n\nThe iPhone 15 is still months away, but it is expected to make the huge migration from a Lighting to USB-C ports, have upgraded A16 SoCs (base and Max models) and new A17 SoC (Pro models), and potentially, keep the same price as the current generation.",

                    "body": "The upcoming iPhone 15 Pro could do away with the previous two separate, physical buttons for volume control. That's according to an exclusive report covering the latest iPhone development rumors and renders.\n\nRumors are mounting that Apple will replace all of the iPhone 15 Pro's physical buttons with solid-state buttons, including a single, redesigned volume button on the side - instead of the two buttons used previously.\n\nBack in October 2022, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple was planning to switch from mechanical buttons to so-called solid-state buttons for the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max devices. So far, however, there have been no further details.\n\nNow CAD drawings and renderings for Apple smartphones have allegedly leaked. The images are now fueling rumors that the regular two-volume buttons will be replaced with a single long button. The online magazine 9to5Mac published an exclusive report and pictures. It says:\n\n\"Almost 100 percent certain that the iPhone 15 Pro has a LONG Unified Volume button instead of 2 separate ones. When creating our iPhone 15 Pro concept, we found that Apple uses 2 pins on each of the 2 volume buttons iPhone 15 Pro CAD shows only 2 pins on a longer volume button.\"\n\nThis would be indicative of the very first iPhones to come with a single rocker-style volume button.\n\nThis design change to the iPhone 15 Pro could give the devices greater water and dust resistance, as a solid-state button needs a much smaller hole in the frame to work. As usual, the new iPhone 15 family is not expected until September 2023. Until then, it will be exciting to see what the rumor mill and leaks bring to light, which will only then prove to be right or wrong. So far there have been rumors of a new design with curved titanium sides and an EU-compliant USB-C charging port.",

                    "title": "This New iPhone 14 Color Is Coming Soon",
                    "body": "Over the past few years, Apple has offered a \"mid-cycle\" refresh of its flagship iPhone lineup each spring, introducing a new colour option to help boost sales. There's no reason to believe this year will be an exception, and if the latest rumour is true, this year's spring colour may be a bright, lemony yellow.\n\nTechnically, the first time Apple released new spring colours was in 2017 with a special edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7. It followed that up in the spring of 2018 with a (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 8 that changed up the front white bezel on the prior model with a sleeker-looking black one.\n\nHowever, since these were special editions, most folks assumed they were exceptions to promote Apple's longstanding partnership with (RED). When the iPhone XR landed a few months later, it offered a rainbow of colour selections for the first time in years, and the (PRODUCT)RED model was among those. The iPhone 11 followed suit, and new spring colour surprises became a thing of the past -- or so we thought.\n\nEven though the iPhone 12 still came in an array of five colours -- including a (PRODUCT)RED edition -- six months later, the company surprised us by releasing a new purple finish for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini. Then, after already shaking up its colour palette in its 2021 lineup, it gave us another new colour in early 2022 with a green iPhone 13.\n\nIn retrospect, we probably should have seen it coming. The iPhone XR and iPhone 11 each came in six colours at launch; Black, White, Yellow, Coral, Blue, and (PRODUCT)RED for the iPhone XR, and Black, White, Yellow, Green, Purple, and (PRODUCT)RED for the iPhone 11.\n\nBy comparison, the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 both offered one less colour at launch -- Black, White, Green, Blue, and (PRODUCT)RED for the iPhone 12, and Midnight, Starlight, Pink, Blue, and (PRODUCT)RED for the iPhone 13 -- leaving room for a new colour to appear in the spring.\n\nThe same holds true for the iPhone 14, which is currently offered in Midnight, Starlight, Blue, Purple, and (PRODUCT)RED. So, it's a safe bet there's a sixth colour waiting in the wings. The only question is: which one?\n\nMultiple sources report that Apple has a product briefing planned for next week, although nobody is quite sure what the company plans to announce. However, the company has yet to send out press invites, so if this does occur on schedule, it would likely be a smaller \"boutique\" event for selected members of the press. It's also possible a more significant product event could be held later this month.\n\nLast year, Apple held a fairly significant event on March 8, where it unveiled the Mac Studio, the third-generation iPhone SE, and the green iPhone 13 and Alpine Green iPhone 13 Pro colours. This also marked the first time Apple had introduced a new colour mid-cycle for its higher-end flagship.\n\nSo, a March announcement for new colours would be right on track, and the consensus from folks who claim to be in the know is that it's going to be yellow this time around.\n\nThe first hint of this was shared by Mac Otakara from a post by Mr. Setsuna Digital on the Chinese social media site Weibo. While that source has no proven track record, the report was later independently corroborated by 9to5Mac.\n\nYellow seems like the most logical choice for a new colour since it's been out of circulation for a while. The 2018 iPhone XR and 2019 iPhone 11 both came in yellow, but it hasn't been seen on an iPhone since.\n\nWhile a new colour for the iPhone 14 (and iPhone 14 Plus) seems like a safe bet, it's less clear whether Apple plans to repeat last year's introduction of a new shade for the iPhone 14 Pro lineup.\n\nLast year, the standard Green and Pro Alpine Green options were in the same family, but it's harder to imagine a shade of yellow that would work for the iPhone 14 Pro without being too similar to the gold version that's already available. Perhaps Apple has perfected the \"Sunset Gold\" that was once rumoured for the iPhone 12 Pro, but it seems we'll have to wait and see.\n\n[The information provided in this article has NOT been confirmed by Apple and may be speculation.

                    "body": "After losing the first batch of OLED panels for the iPhone 15 series, BOE is reportedly the one providing the displays for the upcoming iPhone SE 4. For the first time, this low-entry model will have a 6.1-inch screen with OLED technology.\n\nAccording to the Korean version of The Elec, Samsung Display and LG Display aren't interested in providing the OLED panels for this iPhone since it will use \"components for legacy models.\" That said, Apple has reportedly been focusing on BOE, as it will help with the good relationship the company maintains with China as well as reinforce the importance of the market.\n\nSince the OLED for iPhone SE4 is a panel for legacy models and a low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) thin film transistor (TFT) product with low technical difficulty, Samsung Display and LG Display are less interested in this model. The price of OLED for the 6.1-inch iPhone SE4 is currently estimated to be around $40. Compared to the price of OLED for the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max using low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) thin film transistor (TFT), which is well over $100, $40 is less than half. It is known that the price of LTPO method OLED is twice that of LTPS method OLED of the same size.\n\nRumors about the upcoming iPhone SE 4 come majority by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. While he first said Apple had delayed the introduction of a new SE model, he later said Apple had canceled the production of the fourth generation.\n\nThen, last week, he said not only did Apple resume the development of this smartphone, but it would also bring an in-house 5G modem.\n\nIf his analysis turns out to be accurate, the iPhone SE 4 will be the first iPhone with the company's own 5G modem - a long-time plan to rely less on Qualcomm and better control the integration between hardware and software.\n\nBesides this change, Apple will finally ditch the \"classic\" design on the Home Button iPhone by adding Face ID and a bigger 6.1-inch OLED display.\n\nInterestingly enough, in 2024, Apple is also rumored to bring a design change to the iPhone 16 series, as the Pro models will likely feature an under-display Face ID. While it's unclear if the Dynamic Island will decrease, the fact is that Apple is finally moving to an all-screen design for all of its lineup.",

The left panel looks to be for the iPhone 15 Pro, according to the rumor. It displays Dynamic Island with regular display size and substantially fewer bezels than the iPhone 14 Pro. The iPhone 15 Pro versions may resemble the Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8 in appearance thanks to significantly slimmer bezels surrounding the display.\n\nSEE ALSO: After Blocking ChatGPT Update To Email, Apple Approves This AI-Driven App\n\nThe basic iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus bezels aren't expected to undergo any significant alterations, according to the report. All four iPhone 15 models will have bezels that are slightly curled around the edges, similar to the iPhone 11 series. The films suggest that the Dynamic Island feature, which is now only available on iPhone 14 Pro models, will be introduced to all four iPhone 15 models. According to a previously disclosed CAD model by 9to5Mac, the iPhone 15 Pro might contain a single sensitive volume controller, allowing users to vary volume levels based on where they touch the button.\n\nSEE ALSO: Apple iPhone 14 Canary Yellow Is On The Horizon; Here's All About It\n\nThe unified volume buttons, which would replace the present separate volume up and down buttons, could be a new feature of the iPhone 15 Pro versions, according to the report. According to rumors, the iPhone 15 Pro as well as iPhone 15 Pro Max would have upgraded RAM, a titanium frame, and solid-state buttons featuring sensory feedback.",

The Chinese supplier reportedly encountered \"technological problems\" while producing screens for Apple this year.\n\nCiting The Elec and Chosun Biz, DigiTimes writes that BOE does not have enough time to prove its ability to produce the required OLED panels for the iPhone 15 on a large scale.\n\nInitially, BOE was expected to supply LTPS OLED panels for use in two mid-range iPhone 15s, but the company experienced poor and inconsistent performance due to technology issues. Therefore, it is almost impossible for her to start mass production in June 2023.\n\nThe report adds that LG Display and Samsung Display will very likely be the sole suppliers of OLED panels for the iPhone 15. Samsung Display is expected to produce the majority of these panels. This is because the supplier has a higher production capacity compared to LG Display.\n\nApple is believed to have sought to bring in BOE to reduce its reliance on Samsung Display. BOE was expected to supply 6.1-inch panels for the upcoming iPhone.",

                    "title": "iPhone 15 Pro specs: A17 Bionic chip-backed smartphone likely to have increased demand",
                    "body": "The long-rumoured iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to boast major upgrades over the current iPhone 14 lineup.\n\nApple is expected to take the tech world by storm with its upcoming A17 Bionic chipset. Rumours suggest the A17 chip will bring improved battery life to the iPhone 15 series. On the downside, Apple will reportedly not focus on improving the processing power of its next-gen chipset.\n\nAlso, suppliers in the company's iPhone supply chain claim the A17 Bionic chipset will bring major specification upgrades to the iPhone 15 series. For instance, the upcoming chipset will be over 30 per cent more power efficient than the current A16 Bionic chipset and deliver some unspecified performance upgrades.\n\nThe A17 Bionic chipset reportedly uses a 3nm process to deliver a higher transistor density. As a result, the newfangled chipset will provide better performance while consuming less power. GizmoChina claims Apple has got its hands on the entire first production run of the new N3 process semiconductors from TSMC.\n\nAs a result, Apple will be the only tech behemoth to use a 3nm process this year. Other chipmakers, including MediaTek and Qualcomm, aren't likely to develop 3nm chips. Per reports, Qualcomm wants to \"wait and see,\" while MediaTek isn't developing the said chips due to high production costs.\n\nThe word on the street is that the A17 Bionic chip will power up only the iPhone 15 Pro models, meaning only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will pack the upcoming chipset under the hood. Some suppliers believe there will be increased demand for the handsets since they boast significant upgrades.\n\nPast leaks suggest the iPhone 15 Pro series will house a periscope camera and a new Sony camera sensor. In addition, the higher-end iPhone 15 series models are expected to have solid-state volume and power buttons. Some reports even indicate the devices will undergo a noticeable design overhaul as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models will pack the A16 Bionic chipset. The entire iPhone 15 lineup could support USB-C connectivity. Moreover, Apple could bring the Dynamic Island feature to the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus.\n\nApple has the edge over its rival after acquiring the entire first production run of the N3 process semiconductors from TSMC. The upcoming A17 Bionic chip will be more power efficient and perform better, which are likely to appeal to consumers. It is unclear how Apple's rivals, such as Samsung, will react to the company's advantage over them.\n\nMeanwhile, a Weibo post by the Japanese blog MacOtakara has revealed that Apple is gearing up to unveil a new colour option for the current-gen iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The yellow colour option will probably be released by the end of March.\n\nApple has a reputation for adding new colour variants in the middle of the product cycle to boost sales and gain media attention. To recall, the company released a purple colour option for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini in April 2021. Likewise, it introduced a new Green colour for the iPhone 13 lineup last year.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models are currently available in Product Red, Starlight (White/Silver), Midnight (Black), Purple, and Blue colour options. On the other hand, the iPhone 14 Pro models are available in Space Black, Gold, Silver, and Deep Purple shades. It is unclear whether the purported yellow colour option will also be available for the Pro models.",

                    "body": "You could get a new iPhone 14, but a reconditioned iPhone 13 could be just as good, and cheaper too.\n\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\n\nThe focus of most smartphone buyers is on the latest models, but a refurbished iPhone can be a better choice for many who seek out an upgraded device.\n\nApple and other smartphone producers consistently push for consumers to upgrade to the latest releases, with large numbers doing so every couple of years. With frequent updates, consumers get the latest features, while phone makers earn a hefty chunk of change in return.\n\nFor the wealthy and others who can afford it, upgrades to brand-new hardware make sense, especially if they want to stay on the edge of the technological curve.\n\nPeople who don't necessarily have the same level of resources can't necessarily do the same without impacting the quality of another area of their life.\n\nThere is another route available, in the form of the refurbished iPhone market. Instead of the latest model, you can save a bit of money and pick up an older model.\n\nIn Australia, potential iPhone owners can pick up a refurbished model from PhoneBot, with a wide choice in models, colors, and grades.\n\nHowever, there are still those who wonder \"should I buy a refurbished iPhone?\" It's a serious concern for people unfamiliar with refurbished hardware, but with a little explanation, they can become a great purchase option for the right person.\n\nThe first thing in determining is it worth buying a refurbished iPhone is what a refurbished device actually is. The short answer is that it's a reconditioned used handset.\n\nThe word \"used\" has bad connotations, since that usually means a device that may have gone through a lot before reaching your hands. To some, that could mean a heavily used, massively scratched, and potentially damaged piece of kit.\n\nSince they're pre-used devices, device shoppers could still wonder are refurbished iPhones worth buying. The reconditioning is the key element that makes these devices great.\n\nInstead of being an iPhone sold or traded in by a customer and resold straight away, refurbished iPhones undergo a reconditioning process by the purchasing company.\n\nDepending on the vendor, this can include a clean and inspection of the iPhone, as well as repairs to the casing and other components. For components that go through a lot of use, such as batteries, they could also be replaced entirely.\n\nIn many cases, the refurbished iPhone will be practically as good as new.\n\nYou'll also find that some vendors provide some level of warranty or support for the device, much like you would for brand new hardware. Buying a used iPhone\n\ndoesn't have that sort of protection, making it one of the good reasons to buy a refurbished iPhone.\n\nOn considering is it OK to buy a refurbished iPhone, you need to look at the positives and the negatives. There are a few advantages buying a refurbished iPhone can bring to the table, rather than going down the usual upgrade route.\n\nFor a start, consider the cost of buying a new iPhone. The latest models start from $799 for the base iPhone 14, $999 for the iPhone 14 Pro, with pricing going as high as $1,599.\n\nOf course, there are options to lessen the pain of buying new, such as installment plans and other agreements with carriers. But in the end, you will end up paying the full price of the device.\n\nBy their nature, refurbished devices are cheaper than brand new, since they aren't unused handsets. However, the refurbishment does make them as close to being new as possible.\n\nOf course, there are pros and cons of buying refurbished iPhones, and pricing can well be one of those negatives. The cost of a refurbished iPhone will typically be between that of a used iPhone and a new unit.\n\nHowever, it is to be expected that a refurbished model will be more expensive than a used device. Since it's undergone an inspection, has been reconditioned, and fixed to be as close to new as possible, this work has to be incorporated into the price you pay.\n\nEven so, it is still a much cheaper option than brand-new hardware.\n\nThe whole point of refurbishment is to take something used and make it near-new again.\n\nIt removes all questions that may be lingering about a used iPhone's past since it will be worked on by professionals. Anything that could be a dealbreaker for a used device purchase is not an issue.\n\nThat you can get a smartphone without fear of receiving a heavily scratched and worn device is a big selling point for the refurbished market.\n\nHowever, if you're prepared to accept more wear and tear, you can get a refurbished iPhone for a lower price.\n\nRefurbished devices are often sold in grades, with higher ratings being as close to \"as new\" as possible, and typically are the more expensive option. Lower grades are available which can include scratches and chips to the finish, which can reduce the price.\n\nThese lower-tier devices still go through the same processing as higher-tier variants, so they are checked to be working normally. They're just further away from the pristine new device appearance.\n\nApple is an environmentally conscious company, with sustainability being a big deal when it comes to manufacturing a smartphone. However, while it is making the best efforts to cut down on its impact to the environment, actually producing an iPhone in the first place is a problem.\n\nA December report by Counterpoint Research found that approximately 80% of a smartphone's carbon footprint stems from manufacturing it. Acquiring the raw materials, creating the components, assembling the iPhone, and all of the shipments that happen to get the device into a consumer's hands can all add up to a lot of carbon usage.\n\nSince the refurbished iPhone already exists and doesn't need to be actively manufactured, that cuts out a large amount of the device's overall carbon footprint. Buying refurbished has a minimal impact, compared to brand-new hardware purchases.\n\nThen there's the minimizing of e-waste, as a refurbished iPhone isn't another device heading to landfill.\n\nIs it good to buy a refurbished iPhone? Environmentally speaking, it certainly is.\n\nIt is highly likely that those looking at getting an iPhone at a cheaper price are also coming from a much older model than other upgraders. An iPhone can easily last for years beyond the typical two-year period between upgrades for most users.\n\nThat means some owners are keen to keep using their smartphone for a lot longer to get their money's worth, delaying the upgrade.\n\nThis same contingent may not necessarily have the same urgency to use the latest features as more frequent upgraders.\n\nThis is probably one of the biggest reasons why refurbished phones are the smart choice: no one said you have to upgrade your smartphones to the latest model.\n\nIf you look at the difference between the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, the main changes consist of Emergency SOS via Satellite, Crash Detection, an improved computational photography system, Action Mode for video, an extra GPU core, and an extra hour of battery life.\n\nBarely any of the items on that list could be considered must-have items for people looking to upgrade over a longer timeframe. Indeed, if shown that there's not much generational change between the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, the cheaper iPhone 13 may be the better purchase overall.\n\nEven turning to the Pro lineup, there are bigger improvements, but not everyone wants the cutting-edge tech if they're focusing on saving money. It would be nice to have a 48-megapixel camera sensor as in the iPhone 14 Pro, but the 12-megapixel ones in the iPhone 13 range will do the job for most users anyway.\n\nAdd in that the second-hand cost of the iPhone 13 will be lower than the iPhone 14, it can look like an exceptional buy when looking at refurbished models.\n\nAnyone wondering if refurbished iPhones are good to buy should now be aware that they're a pretty good purchase.\n\nThey are a cost-effective way of getting an iPhone without necessarily dealing with the expense of brand-new items.\n\nIt also sidesteps the inherent issues of the used iPhone market, since you're getting a smartphone that has been checked and worked on to make it as good as possible.\n\nDoing your bit for the environment by cutting down on e-waste and cutting out the carbon footprint of manufacturing is a big bonus too in some circles.\n\nSure, you could still get a brand-new iPhone if you need bleeding-edge specifications and bragging rights for having the latest and best hardware. But if you want to save some money and still have something that can handle a typical user's needs, refurbished is the way to go.\n\nBased in Melbourne, PhoneBot is a refurbished device specialist serving customers across Australia.

                    "body": "Apple is expected to launch its next-gen iPhone 15 series smartphones in the second half of 2023. The rumour mill has already started churning out several speculations about the next iPhone lineup. A tipster named Shrimp Apple Pro took to Twitter to share a post which includes a video showing three glass panels. These panels are likely to be the ones that are expected to be used on the iPhone 15 series. Two out of the three panels in the video appear to be the same size. Rumours suggest that the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pro smartphone will both carry 6.1-inch displays. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 Plus and the iPhone 15 Pro Max (reportedly Ultra) are likely to sport 6.7-inch panels. This means the upcoming iPhone 15 lineup models will arrive with two different-sized panels. However, these panels might have different quality levels.\n\niPhone 15 display panels: What do they look like\n\nAs per the leaked Twitter video, all of the displays seem to have a cutout for the Dynamic Island feature. All four models of the iPhone 15 lineup are expected to support this feature that Apple introduced with the latest iPhone 14 series. The shape-shifting \"notification\" feature is currently available only on Pro the models of the iPhone 14 lineup which are -- iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. The leaked iPhone 15 series panels also feature curved bezels at the corners.\n\nThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are also expected to get the 48MP TrueDepth camera unit found on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. It will replace the 12MP sensors that are currently used on the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus models.\n\nAlong with that, the iPhone 15 non-Pro units are also rumoured to come powered by the A16 Bionic chipset, which currently powers the iPhone 14 Pro series models. The tipster claims that also mentioned having confirmed the authenticity of the displays with other sources.\n\nApple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for the TrueDepth camera\n\nAccording to a report by The Elec, Apple is planning to move the TrueDepth Camera for Face ID from under the display for the iPhone 16 lineup, which is expected to be revealed in 2024. With this change, the iPhone 16 series may ditch the hole-punch cutout reserved for the front-facing FaceTime camera. This will be a major change for the Dynamic Island feature which is expected to get an upgrade in the next two years.\n\niPhone 15 Pro series: Other expected specs\n\nThe Pro and the rumoured Ultra models in the upcoming iPhone 15 series are expected to be powered by the A17 Bionic chipset. This chip is using TSMC's 3nm process node. The high-end iPhones are expected to be one of the first smartphones to come out with 3nm chipsets. Apart from this, the iPhone 15 Ultra can feature a titanium body and a periscope lens that is expected to deliver 10x optical zoom. The iPhone 15 series is expected to be announced in September and released in the same month.",

                    "body": "According to a new report, the iPhone 15 Pro series may make a ring/silent switch a thing of the past. It's not as bad as it sounds, though, as you'll still be able to do the same thing, but in a different way.\n\nBased on a report from 9to5Mac, the ring/silent switch may be replaced with a button. Yes, you read it right. Apple may be moving away from a physical switch, which kinds of makes sense as it's also ditching physical buttons. More on that soon.\n\nThe source mentioned a \"pressing type\" mute in the report, which will allegedly be included on both the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. We did not get an explanation for it, though, so we don't know how will it work, exactly.\n\nOn top of that, we also don't know how will Apple indicate the status. It could do that via software only, but that button will lose some of its charm that way. We'll have to wait and see.\n\nThat's not all, though. The same report also mentions the phone's volume rocker buttons. As many of you know thus far, Apple is expected to implement solid-state buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro series, that goes for both power/lock and volume rocker buttons.\n\nBased on this report, Apple will go from separate up and down buttons for the volume rocker, to a single button. The fact it's moving to a solid-state setup probably has something to do with it, though it could still leave them separate. This is a design choice.\n\nNeedless to say, all this will take some getting used to for Apple users. Apple very rarely makes such changes to its products. The overall design won't change that much, other than what we talked about.\n\nAll iPhone 15 models will include a Dynamic Island setup, though, and all of them will feature Type-C ports at the bottom. The Lightning port will become a thing of the past.",

                    "body": "Apple launched Green iPhone 13 and Alpine Green iPhone 13 Pro in March last year and Purple iPhone 12 Mini and 12 in April 2021.\n\nYellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will soon go official if reports are to be believed. According to Weibo user Setsuna Digital, Apple is set to launch the new colourway this Spring. And if reports from MacRumors are to be believed, Apple's PR team is planning a product briefing in the coming days. Connecting the dots, we can safely assume that we might soon see the new yellow colourways in iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. Here's all you need to know about this new development.\n\nThe report from Setsuna Digital should be taken with a pinch of salt, as we can't be sure of their track record. However, MacRumors has reported that the Apple PR team is planning to host a product briefing next week, which could see the launch of the yellow iPhones. Moreover, folks over at 9to5Mac have also independently confirmed from sources that the Cupertino giant is indeed gearing up to launch the base lineup - iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in Yellow paint job.\n\nIn the past, Apple has only launched iPhone 11, iPhone XR, and iPhone 5C in a Yellow colourway, and iPhone 14 and 14 Plus could be the second time the brand launches this vibrant paint job. However, Apple is known for offering limited or special edition colours of popular iPhone models to boost sales. It launched the iPhone 13 in green, the 13 Pro in Alpine Green in 2022, and the iPhone 12 Mini and 12 in purple the year before.\n\nUnlike Android devices, Apple launches its new iPhone upgrades at its Fall event in September, once a year. Therefore, the company launches new colourways mid-cycle to pique the interest of iPhone fans and boost sales until new iPhones come around.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have a 6.1- and 6.7-inch OLED display with 60Hz refresh rates. They are powered by the A15 Bionic chip and come in up to 512GB storage. In the camera department, both iPhones are equipped with a dual 12MP camera setup on the back and a 12MP selfie camera on the front. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus can last over 20 hours on a single full charge. They support only 20W fast charging, Qi, and Magsafe wireless charging. Both devices boot iOS 16 out of the box and offer support for Face ID.\n\nWould you pick up the yellow colourway or stick to the original colour options instead?

                    "title": "4 iPhone 15 design changes that are bigger than you think for the iPhone's future",
                    "body": "The iPhone 15 series coming out this September will look a lot like the iPhone 14, especially if you're standing several feet away. But the iPhone 15 will feature the biggest redesign since the iPhone 12 series, which brought back the iPhone 4 look and feel. We saw plenty of iPhone 15 leaks already detailing the same changes. The iPhone 15 design reportedly includes Dynamic Island notches for all models, smaller bezels, solid-state buttons, and USB-C connectivity.\n\nThese 4 design updates might seem trivial, but they're much bigger than you think for the future of the iPhone.\n\nWe saw several reports claiming that the iPhone 15 series will feature a uniform design across the four models. The iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max (Ultra) will all get the same Dynamic Island notch. That's great news for buyers looking to purchase one of the more affordable models this year.\n\nWe already explained why the iPhone 14/14 Plus design is impacting sales. Compared to the Pro and Pro Max models, the phones look like old devices. Not to mention that Dynamic Island functionality has turned heads from the moment Apple unveiled it.\n\nFast-forward to early March, and leaker ShrimpApplePro picked up a video from TikTok that shows the purported front glass panel of various iPhone 15 models.\n\nThe glass panels indicate that multiple models will get the Dynamic Island notch design. And the thinner bezels.\n\nWhy is this such a big deal for the future of Apple's iPhone? Apple is moving towards a future where the iPhone will have a perfect all-screen design. The shrinking of the notch via the Dynamic Island is a step towards that future. Apple will soon place Face ID components under the screen, then do the same with the front-facing camera.\n\nOnce that happens, however, Apple will also need to imagine a different design detail to give the iPhone a recognizable identity.\n\nThe glass panel leak above aligns with other iPhone 15 rumors concerning the bezels. Apple's upcoming iPhone should feature 2.5D front and rear glass. That puzzling 2.5D descriptor is familiar because we've used it for other devices, Apple included. It means the glass will bend, but only slightly, around the edges.\n\nTherefore, the iPhone design is moving from flat edges and glass on the iPhone 12, 13, and 14 to slight curvatures for iPhone 15 models.\n\nThe bezel thickness reduction is important here and could result from using curved glass.\n\nThis is important for the iPhone designs of the future for two reasons. First, it gets us close to an iPhone that maximizes the real estate surface of the front side that can be turned into the display area.\n\nSecondly, if Apple wants to wrap the display around the edges for standard or foldable iPhones, it must start curving it at some point. Apple will only do it when and if glass becomes durable enough to survive accidental drops on the side.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will not feature physical buttons you can press. That's what all rumors say, and we've seen CAD design leaks seemingly confirming the feature.\n\nThe buttons will resemble the touchpad on Apple's MacBooks, which doesn't move. It gives you the sensation of movement, but it's all thanks to Taptic Engine/Force Touch.\n\nWhy is this so critical for the iPhone? Again, we have two answers. First, this helps Apple gets closer to the all-screen iPhone. The handset should also lack buttons and ports, which turn the device into a waterproof smartphone. The removal of SIM slots, which started with the iPhone 14 series, is also part of the same plan.\n\nSecondly, the use of solid-state buttons helps Apple deploy a wraparound display. In such a case, the edges could turn into virtual buttons powered by Taptic Engines.\n\nIt's very likely that affordable (non-Pro) iPhones will get solid-state buttons in the future.\n\nThe USB-C port coming to all iPhone 15 models might be a bigger deal than the Dynamic Island notch, slim bezels, or solid-state buttons. It's a feature that buyers have demanded for years, one that the EU mandates from all phones. Apple has to comply, and while the iPhone 15 series could still feature Lightning ports, it looks like Apple isn't waiting for the iPhone 16 for the switch.\n\nThe USB-C port is amazing news for gadget owners. One cable is enough to recharge all devices. Also, you get faster data transfer speeds, although the feature might be limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models.\n\nBut in the future, Apple's all-screen, portless, buttonless iPhone will recharge wirelessly. Until we get there, USB-C will set new standards for convenience, data transfers, and charging speeds. Yes, USB-C might nudge Apple towards increasing charging rates beyond the nearly 30W speed it unofficially supports now. That means battery tech that will maintain battery health for years.\n\nMake no mistake, a portless iPhone will need decent wireless charging speeds beyond what's possible with MagSafe now. And the same battery health argument applies. The adoption of USB-C will go hand in hand with tech advancements in the battery field that Apple will hopefully announce soon.\n\nThere's another reason why USB-C on iPhone 15 is so exciting, and that concerns wired data transfers. Thunderbolt speeds will do wonders for wired backups and large chunks of data transfers. And it will force Apple to hasten the development of a wireless alternative that the portless iPhone will need. A wireless alternative that goes beyond AirDrop tech regarding both speed and reliability.\n\nBecause Apple won't make the switch to a portless iPhone unless the device can match the capabilities of USB-C iPhones.",

This year, it looks like the iPhone 14 will be getting a very seasonal yellow color option, according to a report by Mac Otakara.\n\nAccording to the Japanese blog, the regular iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will get the new yellow finish, while it's currently unclear which new finish the iPhone 14 Pro series could get, if it gets one at all.\n\nBoth 9to5Mac and MacRumors, two of the most credible tech publications on the web today, have reported that their sources say Apple is hosting briefings for journalists this week to show them the new color option. Usually, briefings for new products and new product launches happen in the same week, so if these meetings are indeed taking place, you can expect an announcement of some kind in just a few days.\n\nIn addition, new images suggest Apple will be adding two new colors to its lineup of leather cases for the iPhone 14 series: Deep Violet and Golden Brown. Both were available for previous iPhones, but for some reason never made it to the iPhone 14 line.\n\nOne more thing: while there haven't been any leaks or reports, it's likely Apple will also release new Apple Watch bands alongside the yellow iPhone 14 and new case options. Expect to see a lot of bright, pastel-like band colors in both silicon and nylon flavors, if history is any indication.",

                    "title": "iPhone 14 Pro vs. Galaxy S23 Ultra: Do I Regret Switching to Apple?",
                    "body": "Five months ago, I went from being a die-hard Samsung Galaxy fan to a sellout iPhone owner. Since then, I've fully adapted to the world of Apple and have been basking in the perks of features like AirDrop and iMessage (mostly to the delight of my iFriends, who were sick of my green texts).\n\nLoad Error\n\nBut I still have a soft spot for Galaxy phones, and when Samsung unveiled the S23 lineup in February, I was eager to see how the top-of-the-line S23 Ultra would compare to my iPhone 14 Pro. So I got my hands on one and began using the phones side by side to compare everything from the cameras to battery life to overall design -- and to see whether I'd have any regrets about switching to the \"dark side.\" Here's what I found.\n\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra's display vs. Apple's Super Retina screen\n\nFirst things first: I have an iPhone 14 Pro, and not a Pro Max, so the Ultra's massive screen definitely stands out in comparison. I never feel like I need a bigger screen than what I get on my 14 Pro, but it definitely doesn't hurt to have that larger display when I'm watching a YouTube video or streaming a show -- or spending too much time on TikTok.\n\nThe trade-off to having that larger screen is trying to fit it in my pocket and having to carry something a bit bulkier. Still, it's a pretty sleek phone for all that real estate.\n\nThe display quality on both phones is stellar, and I don't see much of a quality difference between the two. Right out of the box, the S23 Ultra has a nice bright display, which you can achieve on the iPhone by turning off True Tone (a feature that adjusts the color and intensity of your display depending on your environment). If the brightness on the Ultra is too much, you can inversely mimic the effects of True Tone by going into Display settings and either toggling on Eye comfort shield or going to Screen mode and selecting Natural. You can also play with the White balance scale. Images on the iPhone look slightly sharper, but colors pop a bit more on the S23 Ultra. Overall, though, there's really not much of a difference between the phones.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by CNET The keyboard on the Galaxy S23 Ultra (right) places numbers above letters, so you don't have to hop between the two. John Kim/CNET\n\nThere's one aspect to having an iPhone that I haven't quite made peace with yet, and it's the keyboard. I'm glad Apple added Slide to Type with iOS 13 a few years ago, followed by haptic feedback on the keyboard with iOS 16 (finally), because those are features I loved on Android. But I still get frustrated that I have to switch between numbers and letters when I'm typing on the iPhone. Meanwhile, on the Galaxy, the numbers sit just above the letters, so you can select them more quickly, the way you would on a laptop keyboard. You can download different keyboards on the iPhone like Gboard, but it's not the same. I'll admit that's a minor complaint, but I do think the user experience would benefit from Apple taking a page from Android's book -- you know, like they've done many times before. Moving on....\n\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra's battery life is next level \u00a9 Provided by CNET The battery that keeps going. James Martin/CNET\n\nI've had my iPhone for a few months now and thankfully haven't seen any noticeable drops in battery life yet. My phone still lasts a full day of heavy use, but I always need to charge at the end of the day.\n\nThe Ultra's battery is next level. I can go a full day of use and still have some juice left over. That's not surprising, given the S23 Ultra has a 5,000-mAh battery. Apple doesn't share battery capacity for its phones, but says the 14 Pro has up to 23 hours of video playback. An iFixit teardown found the iPhone 14 Pro has a 3,200-mAh battery.\n\nEven though the Ultra has a bigger battery, Apple is actually able to crank out more efficiency from its batteries thanks to iOS and its own A-series chips. Meanwhile, Android has to work with a variety of devices running different processors, so it becomes more important to have that bigger battery.\n\nSpecs and logistics aside, I'm amazed by the Ultra's battery life, as was CNET's mobile reporter Lisa Eadicicco when she reviewed the Ultra.\n\nThe S23 Ultra's 200-megapixel camera\n\nCamera quality is the most important aspect of any phone for me. I take a lot of pictures and videos for work and social media, including for my very niche tea account on Instagram. The camera on the Galaxy phones kept me in the Samsung family for a decade, so I was eager to compare the S23 Ultra's cameras to the iPhone 14 Pro's.\n\nWhat I noticed right away is how much more saturated photos on the Ultra are. In most cases, that saturation adds a nice color boost to images and makes them stand out more. Pictures of my colorful teacups look even more vibrant on the Ultra. Sometimes, that saturation can be a bit overwhelming and makes photos look unnatural, as if there's a filter on them. But other times, it makes colors and subjects stand out, in a good way.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by CNET The Galaxy S23 Ultra's 200-megapixel sensor brings out details and color in this decorative teacup. Abrar Al-Heeti/CNET\n\nThe 200-megapixel sensor on the Ultra punches up color and detail even more. A picture I took of a decorative teacup emphasizes the intricate floral design and gold trim and another image of a Klay Thompson mural shows vivid blues and yellows.\n\nNot all moments are made for a 200-megapixel sensor, though. In another image taken outdoors, the sensor removed a few too many highlights, so it was harder to see detail and make sense of what's going on.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the softness and brightness of photos on the Ultra. Shadows on the iPhone are often a bit too harsh and give some images a darker overtone. An image of the sky on the Ultra will look nice and bright, while on the iPhone, there might be distracting shadows under clouds. The Ultra's softness and brightness also make for more flattering selfies. You can adjust the iPhone's camera settings and play around with things like contrast, tone and color temperature, and even mimic photography styles on the Galaxy (and vice versa), but I do wish the iPhone just automatically adjusted for things like shadows a little better.\n\nThe camera feature that surprised me most was Portrait mode. I think of Portrait mode on the iPhone as the gold standard. The subject is usually in perfect focus, the background is smoothly blurred and the colors are more natural looking. But I noticed there's something the Ultra did better than my iPhone. I took a picture of my friend while she had sunglasses on top of her head, and the iPhone struggled to keep the bridge and sides of the glasses in focus, while the Ultra didn't. It's that small detail that shows how far Portrait mode has come on Galaxy phones. I still prefer the look of iPhone portraits because of the lower saturation, and you can catch a bit more detail in the background, which is nice.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by CNET The picture on the left was taken with Portrait mode on the iPhone 14 Pro, while the one on the right was taken with the Galaxy S23 Ultra. If you look closely, you'll nice the iPhone blurs the bridge and sides of the glasses, while the Ultra doesn't. Abrar Al-Heeti/CNET Does the Galaxy S23 Ultra beat the iPhone at video?\n\nGiven the popularity of TikTok and Instagram Reels right now, video is a huge focus for both Apple and Samsung -- and also important for folks like me who take a lot of videos. Since switching to the iPhone, I've seen an uptick in the quality of my videos. The colors are more natural and the images sharper. Cinematic mode makes subjects pop and lends a more professional look to my content. Samsung has its own Cinematic mode equivalent, called Portrait video. It also does a great job of blurring the background, but objects and people look a little less defined than they do on iPhone.\n\nOne area where the Ultra is a clear winner is with video stabilization. Even walking down the stairs, the footage is incredibly smooth, as if you're using a gimbal. With the iPhone, you can still sense each step being taken, and there's a lot more movement.\n\nThe S23 Ultra's design vs. iPhone 14 Pro\n\nLet's be honest: the iPhone's camera bumps are ridiculous. The Ultra is a breath of fresh air because the cameras don't stick out as much, so it wobbles less when you set it down.\n\nThe S Pen on the Ultra is a fun extra, though I never found myself reaching for it. There's not much I want to write by hand, and I can just tap the screen for pretty much all functions. Still, I'm glad the legacy of the retired Galaxy Note series lives on.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by CNET The S Pen returns on the Galaxy S23 Ultra. James Martin/CNET\n\nThe in-screen fingerprint reader was a favorite feature of mine on my Galaxy phones, and it's nice to have that option again while using the Ultra. I missed it when I first switched to the iPhone, but Face ID is solid enough that I quickly got over it. Unlocking both phones has been seamless.\n\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra's price is the same as the iPhone\n\nThe S23 Ultra is $1,200 for 256 GB of storage and is priced similarly to the iPhone 14 Pro Max with the same amount of storage. The smaller iPhone 14 Pro is $1,100 for 256GB. Whether you're a Galaxy fan or an iPhone lover, $1,200 is a lot. But in this case, you get what you pay for.\n\nGalaxy S23 Ultra vs. iPhone 14 Pro final thoughts \u00a9 Provided by CNET Those camera bumps on the iPhone 14 Pro feel a little excessive. John Kim/CNET\n\nIt's been fun to revisit a world I've abandoned and compare the iPhone I have now to the one I could've had if I'd stayed in the Galaxy family. While there are aspects to the S23 Ultra that I appreciate, like brighter and more colorful images, better video stabilization and incredible battery life, there are advantages to having an iPhone that go beyond specs that'll likely keep me in the Apple ecosystem for a while. Features like Airdrop and iMessage have made the user experience more seamless. And I don't know if I could give up the iPhone's video quality for anything else.\n\nStill, I know that if I want to take a picture that makes people's jaws drop, I'll likely reach for the S23 Ultra. Then I'll wait for the look of shock when I tell them it wasn't taken with an iPhone.\n\nCheck out the video above to see more of my experience trying out these two phones, along with some side-by-side examples of photos and videos taken on each.\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "Rumors believe Apple could release a new yellow iPhone 14 option this week. If this turns out to be accurate, the company could also be readying new cases to the current iPhone lineup. According to Twitter user Majin Bu, who has a good record on iPhone case leaks, Apple is readying at least two different leather cases for the spring.\n\nThe color options are Deep Violet and Golden Brown. These would be for the iPhone 14 Pro models and integrate the existing color options, including Forest Green, Ink, Midnight, Orange, and Umber.\n\nAlongside new iPhone color options in the spring, Apple usually updates the colors of its Apple Watch bands and iPhone silicone and leather cases. While Majin Bu only leaked two colors, it doesn't mean these will be the only options available a few weeks from now.\n\nApple usually brings new case options during the official release of new iPhone and Apple Watch models, and six months later, the company adds a few more colors to match the current season.\n\nWhat's different this time is that Apple might not hold a spring event, as it has been doing for the last few years. In 2022, the company introduced the new MacBook Air, a 5G iPhone SE, the Mac Studio, the Studio Display, new cases for the iPhone 13, including new color options, and new Apple Watch bands.\n\nFor 2023, Apple could announce in this spring event the long-rumored Mac Pro with its own silicon, a new 15-inch MacBook Air, this new iPhone color option, the Mixed-Reality headset, and these new iPhone 14 cases.\n\nApple usually releases new products on Friday, so the company could prepare to unveil the yellow iPhone 14 and these cases in the next few days. BGR will keep reporting on these rumors and let you know if they turn out to be true.",

                    "body": "We've reported several rumours that the iPhone 15 Pro will be significantly slimmer than the current iPhone 14 range. And while the official reveal of the next generation of Apple's best phone is still months away, leaks are already leaking. The latest one, shared on Chinese websites and then posted to Twitter (opens in new tab), show videos of what appears to be the front glass for the Pro and presumably the Pro Max too.\n\nThe videos indicate that the thinner bezels are for the Pro model only; the glass for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus appears to be the same as the current models' glass. But the panels do suggest that rumours of the Dynamic Island making its way from the Pros to all iPhones were correct: the glass here has cutouts for that very thing.\n\nApple appears to be continuing its policy of putting clear blue water between the iPhone Pro / Pro Max and the other models in the range. We've previously heard rumours of a titanium frame for the iPhone 15 Pro, and other reports have suggested more RAM too.\n\nThat extra RAM is more important for the Pro and Pro Max due to its significantly higher resolution camera setup and more powerful image processing, both of which require more memory for smooth performance.\n\nIt's a safe bet that the iPhone 15 will get USB-C this time around, but again there may be a difference between the Pro and the non-Pro versions: the latter are rumoured to be stuck with Lightning speeds, with only the Pro and Pro Max getting the full-fat USB-C data transfer experience. Again, that makes sense for the bigger photos and videos those phones produce.\n\nAnd of course it's another way for Apple to try and tempt you to buy its more expensive, and more profitable, models. In addition to a spec bump this year, we're expecting the Pro to get a price hike too.",

                    "title": "iPhone 14 Pro vs. Galaxy S23 Ultra: Do I Regret Switching to Apple?",
                    "body": "Expertise Abrar has spent her career at CNET breaking down the latest trends on TikTok, Twitter and Instagram, while also reporting on diversity and inclusion initiatives in Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Credentials Named a Tech Media Trailblazer by the Consumer Technology Association in 2019, a winner of SPJ NorCal's Excellence in Journalism Awards in 2022 and has twice been a finalist in the LA Press Club's National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Awards.\n\nBut I still have a soft spot for Galaxy phones, and when Samsung unveiled the S23 lineup in February, I was eager to see how the top-of-the-line S23 Ultra would compare to my iPhone 14 Pro. So I got my hands on one and began using the phones side by side to compare everything from the cameras to battery life to overall design -- and to see whether I'd have any regrets about switching to the \"dark side.\" Here's what I found.\n\nFirst things first: I have an iPhone 14 Pro, and not a Pro Max, so the Ultra's massive screen definitely stands out in comparison. I never feel like I need a bigger screen than what I get on my 14 Pro, but it definitely doesn't hurt to have that larger display when I'm watching a YouTube video or streaming a show -- or spending too much time on TikTok.\n\nThe trade-off to having that larger screen is trying to fit it in my pocket and having to carry something a bit bulkier. Still, it's a pretty sleek phone for all that real estate.\n\nThe display quality on both phones is stellar, and I don't see much of a quality difference between the two. Right out of the box, the S23 Ultra has a nice bright display, which you can achieve on the iPhone by turning off True Tone (a feature that adjusts the color and intensity of your display depending on your environment). If the brightness on the Ultra is too much, you can inversely mimic the effects of True Tone by going into Display settings and either toggling on Eye comfort shield or going to Screen mode and selecting Natural. You can also play with the White balance scale. Images on the iPhone look slightly sharper, but colors pop a bit more on the S23 Ultra. Overall, though, there's really not much of a difference between the phones.\n\nThere's one aspect to having an iPhone that I haven't quite made peace with yet, and it's the keyboard. I'm glad Apple added Slide to Type with iOS 13 a few years ago, followed by haptic feedback on the keyboard with iOS 16 (finally), because those are features I loved on Android. But I still get frustrated that I have to switch between numbers and letters when I'm typing on the iPhone. Meanwhile, on the Galaxy, the numbers sit just above the letters, so you can select them more quickly, the way you would on a laptop keyboard. You can download different keyboards on the iPhone like Gboard, but it's not the same. I'll admit that's a minor complaint, but I do think the user experience would benefit from Apple taking a page from Android's book -- you know, like they've done many times before. Moving on....\n\nI've had my iPhone for a few months now and thankfully haven't seen any noticeable drops in battery life yet. My phone still lasts a full day of heavy use, but I always need to charge at the end of the day.\n\nThe Ultra's battery is next level. I can go a full day of use and still have some juice left over. That's not surprising, given the S23 Ultra has a 5,000-mAh battery. Apple doesn't share battery capacity for its phones, but says the 14 Pro has up to 23 hours of video playback. An iFixit teardown found the iPhone 14 Pro has a 3,200-mAh battery.\n\nEven though the Ultra has a bigger battery, Apple is actually able to crank out more efficiency from its batteries thanks to iOS and its own A-series chips. Meanwhile, Android has to work with a variety of devices running different processors, so it becomes more important to have that bigger battery.\n\nSpecs and logistics aside, I'm amazed by the Ultra's battery life, as was CNET's mobile reporter Lisa Eadicicco when she reviewed the Ultra.\n\nCamera quality is the most important aspect of any phone for me. I take a lot of pictures and videos for work and social media, including for my very niche tea account on Instagram. The camera on the Galaxy phones kept me in the Samsung family for a decade, so I was eager to compare the S23 Ultra's cameras to the iPhone 14 Pro's.\n\nWhat I noticed right away is how much more saturated photos on the Ultra are. In most cases, that saturation adds a nice color boost to images and makes them stand out more. Pictures of my colorful teacups look even more vibrant on the Ultra. Sometimes, that saturation can be a bit overwhelming and makes photos look unnatural, as if there's a filter on them. But other times, it makes colors and subjects stand out, in a good way.\n\nThe 200-megapixel sensor on the Ultra punches up color and detail even more. A picture I took of a decorative teacup emphasizes the intricate floral design and gold trim and another image of a Klay Thompson mural shows vivid blues and yellows.\n\nNot all moments are made for a 200-megapixel sensor, though. In another image taken outdoors, the sensor removed a few too many highlights, so it was harder to see detail and make sense of what's going on.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the softness and brightness of photos on the Ultra. Shadows on the iPhone are often a bit too harsh and give some images a darker overtone. An image of the sky on the Ultra will look nice and bright, while on the iPhone, there might be distracting shadows under clouds. The Ultra's softness and brightness also make for more flattering selfies. You can adjust the iPhone's camera settings and play around with things like contrast, tone and color temperature, and even mimic photography styles on the Galaxy (and vice versa), but I do wish the iPhone just automatically adjusted for things like shadows a little better.\n\nThe camera feature that surprised me most was Portrait mode. I think of Portrait mode on the iPhone as the gold standard. The subject is usually in perfect focus, the background is smoothly blurred and the colors are more natural looking. But I noticed there's something the Ultra did better than my iPhone. I took a picture of my friend while she had sunglasses on top of her head, and the iPhone struggled to keep the bridge and sides of the glasses in focus, while the Ultra didn't. It's that small detail that shows how far Portrait mode has come on Galaxy phones. I still prefer the look of iPhone portraits because of the lower saturation, and you can catch a bit more detail in the background, which is nice.\n\nGiven the popularity of TikTok and Instagram Reels right now, video is a huge focus for both Apple and Samsung -- and also important for folks like me who take a lot of videos. Since switching to the iPhone, I've seen an uptick in the quality of my videos. The colors are more natural and the images sharper. Cinematic mode makes subjects pop and lends a more professional look to my content. Samsung has its own Cinematic mode equivalent, called Portrait video. It also does a great job of blurring the background, but objects and people look a little less defined than they do on iPhone.\n\nOne area where the Ultra is a clear winner is with video stabilization. Even walking down the stairs, the footage is incredibly smooth, as if you're using a gimbal. With the iPhone, you can still sense each step being taken, and there's a lot more movement.\n\nLet's be honest: the iPhone's camera bumps are ridiculous. The Ultra is a breath of fresh air because the cameras don't stick out as much, so it wobbles less when you set it down.\n\nThe S Pen on the Ultra is a fun extra, though I never found myself reaching for it. There's not much I want to write by hand, and I can just tap the screen for pretty much all functions. Still, I'm glad the legacy of the retired Galaxy Note series lives on.\n\nThe in-screen fingerprint reader was a favorite feature of mine on my Galaxy phones, and it's nice to have that option again while using the Ultra. I missed it when I first switched to the iPhone, but Face ID is solid enough that I quickly got over it. Unlocking both phones has been seamless.\n\nThe S23 Ultra is $1,200 for 256 GB of storage and is priced similarly to the iPhone 14 Pro Max with the same amount of storage. The smaller iPhone 14 Pro is $1,100 for 256GB. Whether you're a Galaxy fan or an iPhone lover, $1,200 is a lot. But in this case, you get what you pay for.\n\nIt's been fun to revisit a world I've abandoned and compare the iPhone I have now to the one I could've had if I'd stayed in the Galaxy family. While there are aspects to the S23 Ultra that I appreciate, like brighter and more colorful images, better video stabilization and incredible battery life, there are advantages to having an iPhone that go beyond specs that'll likely keep me in the Apple ecosystem for a while. Features like Airdrop and iMessage have made the user experience more seamless. And I don't know if I could give up the iPhone's video quality for anything else.\n\nStill, I know that if I want to take a picture that makes people's jaws drop, I'll likely reach for the S23 Ultra. Then I'll wait for the look of shock when I tell them it wasn't taken with an iPhone.\n\nCheck out the video above to see more of my experience trying out these two phones, along with some side-by-side examples of photos and videos taken on each.",

                    "body": "Gen Zs might be pushing Apple toward the level of dominance that it has in the US.\n\nThe generation - anyone born after 1996 - apparently has an increased preference for iPhones, causing the adoption of Android phones to shrink substantially.\n\nThe new data - revealed in a report by The Financial Times - shows that Generation Z makes up 34% of all iPhone owners in the US and only 10% of US Samsung users, notes PetaPixel.\n\nAdditionally, market research firm Counterpoint, Apple increased its overall US market share of actual phone usage from 35% in 2019 to more than 50% in 2022.\n\nBeyond the US, iPhone preferences among Gen Z are growing.\n\n83% of Apple users under the age of 25 in Europe say they plan to keep using an iPhone, while Android users are less than half that percentage.\n\nIn fact, Gen Z is going all in with Apple devices, with users more likely to purchase other products like AirPods, Apple Watches, and Macs over any other alternatives.\n\nResearch by market intelligence firm Canalys shows that for every 100 iPhones Apple sells around the world, it also sells 26 iPads, 17 Apple Watches, and 35 pairs of AirPods.\n\nFor Samsung, every 100 smartphone sales lead to fewer than 11 tablets, six smartwatches, and six pairs of wireless earbuds being sold.\n\niPhone's design, AirDrop feature for sharing photos, and its camera are the main selling factors, while the general attitude among GenZs is that iPhones are inherently \"cooler\" than their Android counterparts:\n\nThe current high-end iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphones both have similar camera components and take high-resolution photos. However, some Generation Z users prefer the color expression of the photos on an iPhone and believe that Apple offers a better camera for everyday settings.\n\nIf your teen is asking for an iPhone, and you feel you have to oblige or risk them suffering some kind of social slaughter, there are options.\n\nAs South Africa's largest independent Apple retailer, Digicape offers an outstanding selection of the latest Apple products\n\nYou can buy an iPhone 11 from Digicape for as little as R10 799. Forking out for the latest model, like an iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Pro, will start from R19 999.\n\nMaking the switch from Android to iPhone is also made 10x easier, thanks to Apple's Move to iOS app.\n\nAll you'll need is a Wi-Fi network and access to both phones and access to the Google Play Store on your Android device. From there, each step is really simply laid out by Apple Support.\n\nGo on, join the \"bright side\" - Digicape will be waiting to assist with all your Apple-related queries once you've decided to take the plunge.",

                    "body": "We've been hearing, for a while now, that all iPhone 15 models will include a Dynamic Island setup. Well, now we can visualize it, kind of. The iPhone 15 series glass panels have been shared online by a well-known tipster, ShrimpApplePro.\n\nHe shared them via his Twitter, as he posted a short video of them. He says that he was able to confirm the authenticity of this with his source, so... there you have it. You can check out the video below this paragraph.\n\nYou will notice that there are only three panels shown here. Two of them are the same size and smaller than the third one, so those are probably the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro panels. The third one is a bit larger, so it's either for the iPhone 15 Plus or iPhone 15 Pro Max, though we'd guess the latter.\n\nWhy? Well, because of the bezels. They're quite thin, as they are on the utmost-level panel, which most likely belongs to the iPhone 15 Pro. The front glass on the right has thicker bezels, so that is probably one for the vanilla iPhone 15.\n\nAs a reminder, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro are tipped to include 6.1-inch displays. The iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro Max, on the flip side, will feature 6.7-inch panels.\n\nAll of these phones are expected to launch in September this year. The 'Pro' models are rumored to include solid-state buttons, while all devices will not only have a Dynamic Island setup, but Type-C ports as well.\n\nThey will become the first iPhones to utilize a Type-C setup. Apple may place some limitations on that port, though, and allow only certified accessories to take full advantage of it.

                    "body": "AppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\n\nDisplay producer BOE may still end up producing OLED screens for Apple's latest models, with it apparently set to supply the panels for the fourth-generation iPhone SE.\n\nChinese manufacturer BOE has a history of making iPhone display panels, but also having a troubled relationship with Apple concerning the quality of its components. Though it has reportedly failed to be added to the supply chain for a rumored OLED iPad, it could still be picked to provide panels for another device.\n\nThe supplier is now claimed to be concentrating its efforts on creating OLED panels for the next generation of the iPhone SE, according to supply chain sources of TheElec.\n\nIt is believed that the low-cost nature of the iPhone SE, using component designs from legacy models, could play into BOE's favor. Typical iPhone suppliers Samsung Display and LG Display won't be interested in producing the low-cost components, giving BOE an entrypoint.\n\nCurrent estimates for the 6.1-inch OLED panel for the iPhone SE 4 put its cost at around $40, with the use of a low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) thin film transistor (TFT) design thought to be of a low technical difficulty to produce. This also makes it a component that BOE could have more chance of producing at a level acceptable to Apple's high standards.\n\nThe $40 price is also less than half the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panel cost for the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is thought to be in excess of $100 per unit.\n\nSamsung Display's involvement in eight iPhone models, including the four iPhone 15 models, will also mean that it will have less incentive to create the iPhone SE 4 panels. Meanwhile, it is assumed LG Display will focus on LTPO panels, not LTPS.\n\nThe Elec has a reasonable track record for reporting on movements within Apple's supply chain. It is far less accurate when it discusses what Apple's plans are for the parts in question.",

                    "body": "Display producer BOE may still end up producing OLED screens for Apple's latest models, with it apparently set to supply the panels for the fourth-generation iPhone SE.\n\nChinese manufacturer BOE has a history of making iPhone display panels, but also having a troubled relationship with Apple concerning the quality of its components. Though it has reportedly failed to be added to the supply chain for a rumored OLED iPad, it could still be picked to provide panels for another device.\n\nThe supplier is now claimed to be concentrating its efforts on creating OLED panels for the next generation of the iPhone SE, according to supply chain sources of TheElec.\n\nIt is believed that the low-cost nature of the iPhone SE, using component designs from legacy models, could play into BOE's favor. Typical iPhone suppliers Samsung Display and LG Display won't be interested in producing the low-cost components, giving BOE an entrypoint.\n\nCurrent estimates for the 6.1-inch OLED panel for the iPhone SE 4 put its cost at around $40, with the use of a low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) thin film transistor (TFT) design thought to be of a low technical difficulty to produce. This also makes it a component that BOE could have more chance of producing at a level acceptable to Apple's high standards.\n\nThe $40 price is also less than half the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panel cost for the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is thought to be in excess of $100 per unit.\n\nSamsung Display's involvement in eight iPhone models, including the four iPhone 15 models, will also mean that it will have less incentive to create the iPhone SE 4 panels. Meanwhile, it is assumed LG Display will focus on LTPO panels, not LTPS.\n\nThe Elec has a reasonable track record for reporting on movements within Apple's supply chain. It is far less accurate when it discusses what Apple's plans are for the parts in question.\n\nRead on AppleInsider",

                    "title": "iPhone 14 Pro vs. Galaxy S23 Ultra: Camera, Battery, Display Comparison - Video",
                    "body": "Speaker 1: I wanna see how my iPhone 14 Pro compares to the Samsung Galaxy S 23 Ultra. A few months ago I went from being a diehard Galaxy owner to a sellout iPhone owner, but when Samsung announced the Galaxy S 23 Ultra, I knew I had to get my hands on it and try out everything from the camera to the battery life and see how the design of it compares to my iPhone. So let's see if I have any regrets about switching [00:00:30] over to the dark side. Speaker 1: Now, I would love to say that I'm the kind of person who wakes up at Dawn, gets her morning coffee and then reads the news. But in reality, I wake up, reach for my phone and then scroll through TikTok for 20 minutes. So that's where the display comes in. Now I love the display on the S 23 Ultra. It's bright and it's vibrant and the colors really pop on the iPhone. I do like the sharpness of the images [00:01:00] and the best comparison, the best way that I can get the iPhone to match up to what the S 23 Ultra offers is when I turn off true tone on the iPhone. So that true tone is really kind of what kind of matches your environment. So it's not super bright in your face, but I kind of like that brightness. But I like that you have the option on the iPhone to kind of turn that on and off. Speaker 1: And even on, on the S 23 Ultra, you can play with like the blue light settings and kind of tone down that brightness if you need. So when it comes to brightness and vibrancy, I do like that on the S 23 Ultra a little bit more, [00:01:30] it makes those videos pop a little bit more. As I'm scrolling through TikTok and Instagram, one of the things I really miss on Galaxy phones is the keyboard, because when you're typing on there, you have the numbers and the letters all in one spot. So you don't have to jump between like the numbers and the letters like you do on the iPhone. It sounds like a really small thing, but honestly it's something, it's like a learning curve for me to have to be like, all right, gotta type a number now I gotta type the time, let me go hit that number button and then type it in. Speaker 1: So it's, it's been really nice to have that all in [00:02:00] one place. Again, now I have the iPhone 14 pro and not the Pro Max, so I'm not gonna compare screen size. Obviously that would be comparing apples to oranges. But you know, one of the downsides to having such a massive screen here is that you have to figure out how to fit it in your pocket. Having the iPhone 14 pro, it fits a lot better in my hand and then also a lot better in my pocket, which is really nice. So if you want that nice big display, which is great for videos, you're gonna pay the price of having to figure out where to put it. It [00:02:30] fits well in jacket pockets and in my purse and in my backpack obviously, but I do kind of worry when I just put it in like my pants pocket that it might fall out. Speaker 1: So that's the one downside to having that larger display. Now the battery is also a really big deal to me because I hate carrying an external charger. They're heavy, they're annoying, very convenient, but very annoying. So I, I really wanna make sure I have a film that will last me throughout the day when I'm taking pictures and videos and again scrolling through TikTok. So I have had this iPhone [00:03:00] 14 pro for probably about five months now. And obviously when you get a new phone, the battery is, you know, top performance at that point and as you use it, the battery wears down. But I don't feel like I've seen, you know, a huge degradation in the battery on my iPhone 14 pro over these few months. But as 23 Ultra, this battery blows my mind. Honestly, I can spend a full day of taking pictures and videos and scrolling through social media and I will still have juice left over at the end of the day. Speaker 1: Again, this is not surprising considering [00:03:30] this is Samsung's top the line phone. It has a 5,000 million amp power battery. Apple doesn't share its battery capacity for the iPhone 14 Pro or any of its phones really, but it says that it has up to 23 hours of video playback and I fix it, which did a tear down of the iPhone 14 Pro says it has eight 30 200 million power battery. So obviously different capacities there, but the iPhone will still last me a full day of use. This is just going to take you a little bit further and I've, I've really been, my mind [00:04:00] has been blown by this to be honest. Speaker 1: Now the most important thing to me because I am a millennial who takes way too many pictures and is a little too obsessed with social media, is the camera, I've always sworn by the quality of the Galaxy cameras. I love that they really bring out the color in photos and they're very vibrant. And honestly, I have fooled many an iPhone user into thinking that my really nice pictures were taken with my iPhone [00:04:30] when in reality they were taken with a Galaxy phone. So we need to dispel the rumor that iPhones are the best at everything. So I do love that on the Galaxy S 23 ultra colors are a lot more saturated and vibrant and in most cases that works. Like I took some pictures of TEACs and it, they really like brought out the color of the design and the flowers really pop and outdoors. Speaker 1: I honestly think it really shines in nature because it really just brings out the colors of plants. Um, and [00:05:00] the sky always looks so much more beautiful and blue on the iPhone. It is a bit more toned down. But I do think that there are a lot of pictures that look a lot more natural on the iPhone. So sometimes the saturation on the galaxy is a bit too much and it looks a little unrealistic. But on the iPhone, you know, you do get that more natural look at the expense of having sometimes harsher shadows. Like there's a picture I took of the sky where the clouds are a little bit too contrasted with with the sky and, and I like the look better on [00:05:30] the Galaxy S 23 Ultra. The one thing that I will give iPhone is it really knows how to take the best portrait mode photos, in my opinion. Speaker 1: I took a portrait photo of my friend using the S 23 Ultra and then the iPhone 14 probe. And I noticed that on the iPhone there were parts, so she had sunglasses at the top of her head and there were some parts of the sunglasses that were blurred. So the bridge of the nose was blurred and the side of the glasses were blurred and it's really hard to pick out those details, especially when they're tiny. But then I looked at [00:06:00] the picture that was taken on the ultra and every part of the sunglasses was in focus. And I was kind of surprised by that because Apple was a very early pioneer of portrait mode and I kind of expected to have him have that figured out. I was kind of surprised that the Galaxy actually won over in that case, again, that picture was a little bit more saturated than I would've liked. Speaker 1: I did like the colors more on the iPhone, but the detail is what made the ultra win. In that case, I take a lot of photos and videos, not just for work, but [00:06:30] also for my personal social media accounts, including my very niche tea account. Follow al, he tea t get it, it's like T. And so I wanna make sure I have a camera that makes my content pop. And one of the things that I had to play with on the S 23 Ultra is that new 200 megapixel sensor. So I took a picture of a teacup that has gold trim around it. I took a regular 12 megapixel photo and then I took the 200 megapixel photo and I really loved [00:07:00] the amount of detail that popped with a 200 megapixel sensor. You can see like every little bit of that gold trim, the colors are more vibrant, it automatically kind of blurs out the background a little bit more. Speaker 1: So you're focused on what you need to be focused on. So in that case, I did like the photo that was taken with the 200 megapixel sensor more, but there are some instances where I actually preferred just the regular 12 megapixel. It depends on the lighting. So I was outdoors and I took a picture from Twin Peaks in San Francisco and I took a regular 12 megapixel [00:07:30] photo and then the 200 megapixel. And what that did is it kind of eliminated a little too many highlights. So I look at the grass, it's a little bit darker, you're missing some of that contrast and that detail. And even in the background, some of those highlights are gone, so you're missing some of the detail there too. So in that case, I would've gone with the 12 megapixel option. Of course, all these photos are customizable, you can play around with the settings, but I am just the everyday user. Speaker 1: I just wanna be able to take that picture, push a couple buttons and be ready to go. We have to talk about the ridiculous [00:08:00] 10 x zoom on the ultra. This is something that I had to play with up at Twin Peaks in San Francisco. And what I did is I took a regular one x three X and then 10 x Zoom. And from all the way back there I could zoom in on Salesforce tower and then even see the ferry building out in, you know, in the way distance. But even when I punched in really close, I didn't lose that Christmas or that clarity in the photo, which was really, really cool. The iPhone has three x Zoom, that's pretty good too, but [00:08:30] I, I really was very impressed with that 10 x zoom. And that's something that these phones are, are known for. And I get y Speaker 1: I miss taking selfies on the Galaxy phones because they just smooth over your face. You just look nice. Those shadows are gone on the iPhone. It has been an adjustment for me to take selfies on there. Again, they don't look bad, but I do wish there were, you know, those shadows were a bit toned down. I do wish it just kind of smoothed things over on their own too. [00:09:00] But yeah, I, I've really enjoyed taking selfies on the galaxy. Nighttime photography is another thing that I have always loved on the Galaxy phones, but it looks like iPhone has really stepped it up too. So I took some side by side photos at night and I actually really like the darkness of the sky on the iPhone. It does come at the cost of kind of muting the colors around it a little bit more on the galaxy. Speaker 1: This building has a bit more color and brightness to it, but the sky isn't as deep black [00:09:30] as it is on the iPhone. I still prefer the photos on the galaxy at night, but I've been really impressed with how much iPhone has stepped it up. One thing that both companies have really been focused on is that cinema quality video. It's not really surprising that companies are focused on video right now. I mean, you think about how big TikTok and Instagram reels are right now, so it makes sense. And personally for my own TikTok and Instagram account, I have really enjoyed taking videos on my iPhone. I do think the videos look [00:10:00] a lot better. They, especially with cinematic mode, that's something that I've really loved. Just the way it blurs out the background makes that subject stand out and it's not overly saturated or or unnaturally colored. Speaker 1: So I do think iPhone takes the prize when it comes to video and I've been really happy with that side of things. I mentioned cinematic mode on the iPhone, on the Galaxy, it's called Portrait Video and this basically has the same effect. So the subject stands out and then the background is a bit more blurred. And you can take that more kind of cinematic style video. [00:10:30] What absolutely blew me away on the galaxy is video stabilization. So we took some videos of walking down the stairs and on the iPhone you can still kind of tell that you're taking some steps and the camera's shaking a little bit on the galaxy. It looks like you're using a gimbal. It is so smooth, you can't really see all those little shaky movements. This isn't really anything new. I had a Galaxy S nine a few years ago and I was in a helicopter taking videos and I was worried that everything would be incredibly shaky and just not look good, but [00:11:00] it was very smooth when I checked the footage later. So it's cool to see that Samsung has had this figured out for a while and just to see how smooth that entire walking and stepping motion was on the galaxy. Speaker 1: I have loved the experience of having an iPhone. I think the design is great, but I was kind of taken aback by how much I loved the design of the S 23 Ultra as well. One of the things that I really appreciate is that even though you have all [00:11:30] these cameras, when you set it on a table, they don't stick out as much, so it doesn't wobble, I think. I think these iPhone cameras are doing a little too much. I think they're sticking out too much. So when you set it on a table, it definitely wobbles even with my case, cuz a lot of the cases kind of stick out to protect the cameras too. And it just wobbles the downside again, to having a larger screen is not just having that bigger space to have to fit into pockets, but also it's kind of thick. Speaker 1: It's a bit thicker and chunkier than I would like to carry all the time. This is even without [00:12:00] a case. So once you put a case on it, it's going to become even more bulky. So I like that the iPhone fits better into my hands and also just fits better wherever I need to put it. And is a little bit, a little bit easier to handle. The S 23 Ultra also has that really nice S pen. To be honest. I think it's more of a nice to have versus a need to have. I never really find myself reaching for it because A, I don't really ever feel compelled to write anything by hand, especially not on a phone. And then b, I can just tap things [00:12:30] with my fingers. It's what I'm used to. I don't necessarily need that stylist, but I do think that it's really nice that the legacy of the Note can live on in the S 23 Ultra and I hope they continue to add that S pen cause I know that there are people who are really big fans of it and would be really sad if that went away. Speaker 1: One feature that I think has significantly improved on the Galaxy phones is face recognition. So on my old Galaxy phones, I used to have a really hard time unlocking them if I was wearing glasses or in a dark room, but I've had much better luck on this guy. [00:13:00] It's been much better at recognizing me with glasses without glasses in bright light not. And so I'm pleasantly surprised by that. The other really nice thing is that there is a fingerprint sensor in the screen. So if you don't wanna deal with face recognition, you can do that. And also the fingerprint sensor is actually a more secure way to unlock your phone. So it's nice to have that option. I did miss having that fingerprint reader when I got the iPhone, but I kind of quickly got over it because face ID is really, really solid and I do think [00:13:30] it is a little bit more of a seamless process and I, I think face ID really has that figured out. Speaker 1: If price is your determining factor for which phone to get, you are going to pay a little bit more for the S 23 Ultra, which is to be expected because this is Samsung's top of the line phone. So you're gonna pay $1,200 for 256 gigabytes of storage on the S 23 Ultra and then on the iPhone 14 Pro you're going to pay $1,100 for the same amount of storage. I do wanna note that the S 23 Ultra is the same price [00:14:00] as iPhones top of the line. iPhone 14 Pro Max. So that's the bigger version of my phone. Speaker 1: Overall, it has been really fun to revisit a world that I've abandoned and see what kind of phone I might have had if I hadn't switched teams and switched over to the iPhone. At the end of the day, I think there are aspects to having an iPhone that go beyond things like battery life that will keep me in the Apple ecosystem for a long time. [00:14:30] And those are things like iMessage and airdrop that have really made that user experience more seamless. It's been a lot easier to communicate with my friends. It's been a lot easier to send things to my MacBook, so I think I'm going to stay team Apple for a while. And also the iPhone suits my needs. The battery life is perfect for me. The camera's really great, even if there are some slight trade offs, like less flattering selfies or some really harsh shadows in some pictures. Speaker 1: I think overall it really does fit what I need and I don't really have any regrets just yet. [00:15:00] But at the same time, I do find myself wishing that I could just kind of keep this handy for when I wanna take a picture that really makes people's jaws drop and then blow their minds that it was not taken with an iPhone. Now after a full day of testing out these phones, it's time to end my day the way I started it by scrolling through TikTok. But which phone will I reach for? Let us know in the comments which phone you're more impressed with and which specs are most important to you.

                    "body": "The new report shows front glass designs of the upcoming series\n\nApple is expected to launch the iPhone 15 series later this year. The lineup will most likely include four models -- the base iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. This time, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to sport the 'Ultra' moniker. There have been multiple leaks and reports surrounding the upcoming devices. One such recent leak has suggested details around the display on the base iPhone 15 and the Pro models. A tipster has posted a video, showcasing purported front glass panels of the soon-to-be-released iPhone models.\n\nTipster ShrimpApplePro tweeted a video showing a set of front glass panels that will reportedly be used on the upcoming iPhone series, set to be released later this year. The tipster claimed the leak's authenticity had been verified from a source.\n\nThe video shows three glass panels that correspond to our expectations for the iPhone 15 lineup. The iPhone 15 Pro seems to be in the leftmost panel in the video. It has the same display size and Dynamic Island as the iPhone 14 Pro, but with significantly thinner bezels.\n\nThe middle glass is the biggest of the three, suggesting it could be the front glass of the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It features the identical Dynamic Island at the top, and the larger display area highlights the thinner bezels even more. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max display will most probably appear more immersive than that of any iPhone screens released to date.\n\nThe final panel shown in the video is distinguished by a noticeably thicker bezel, which is also seen in the base iPhone 14 series. The panel, likely to be the one on the base iPhone 15, also includes the Dynamic Island. The feature on non-Pro models will be an upgrade from its predecessors. The Phone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus feature a traditional notch housing the front camera and sensors.\n\nThe tipster had also earlier suggested that the upcoming iPhone models would only support USB Type-C accessories accredited by Apple's Made for iPhone (MFi) programme. They asserted that Apple could restrict charging speed and other performance characteristics of unsupported cables. According to the source in the report, iPhone manufacturer Foxconn has begun mass production of accessories such as EarPods and cables.",

                    "body": "Apple plans to launch its next low-cost model, the iPhone SE 4, next year, with the company reportedly relying on Chinese supplier BOE to fulfill the display shipments responsibility. For the first time, the company is expected to switch to OLED technology for this model, and according to estimates, Apple will be spending quite an amount on just the panels; $80 million.\n\nBOE will take the responsibility of supplying iPhone SE 4 OLED screens because it was not able to do the same with the iPhone 15, according to The Elec. With Samsung and LG seemingly preoccupied with providing Apple with panels for its flagship iPhone family slated to launch later this year, BOE has been tasked with the iPhone SE 4. This version is said to feature a 6.1-inch OLED, meaning that it will share the same diagonal screen size as the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14.\n\nWhile Apple can re-use some of the older, unsold inventory, the report states that BOE will provide approximately 20 million OLED units for the iPhone SE 4. Assuming Apple manages to sell all of these, that will be quite a large number added to its overall tally, with its success opening up several opportunities for the company in developing markets.\n\nWith each iPhone SE 4 panel being the LTPS variant, it is less costly to manufacture, with the report mentioning a $40 price per display. With 20 million units expected to be shipped next year, we are looking at an $80 million bill for Apple in display shipments alone, so that is quite a large sum of money. Then again, if the affordable iPhone is sold at the same $429 price as the iPhone SE 3, that alone amounts to $8.58 billion in sales, and that too for the base version.\n\nSure, the amount is nothing compared to the billions that Apple may make when the iPhone 16 series launches next year, but the iPhone SE 4 was never positioned as a device that would sell in droves. Instead, anyone who wishes to experience iOS or to gravitate towards Apple's product range slowly will go for this one. Since customers will be treated to a newer design and obvious upgrades, it is more than possible that it will do well in multiple markets.",

Until now, several rumors have claimed way too much about the upcoming iPhone series by Apple. A previous rumor indicated that iPhone 15 could be the first smartphone to feature Wi-Fi 6E. In addition to this, a prototype image of the iPhone 15 also surfaced on the internet. Recently, some fresh pieces of information shed some light on the front glass panels of the forthcoming smartphones.\n\nAccording to sources, the front glass panels of iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and Pro Max will feature Dynamic Island. It will pill-shaped cutout. The cutout will entertain the selfie camera and FaceID sensors. Reportedly, the Pro models of the iPhone 15 series will feature slim bezels in contrast to the regular iPhone 15. Where it is anticipated that the iPhone 15 will use the same panels as provided with the 14Pro series.\n\nThese recent pieces of information are based on Chinese blogs. According to these sources, the panels for the Pro models will accompany a new 2.5D arc edge processing. It will have an increased curvature. Such an advancement in the display screen suggests that it could be somewhat difficult to place a screen protector on the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Some speculations suggest that the length and width of the frame borders are reduced by about 0.5mm.",

                    "body": "If that wasn't enough sources for this claim, another SAP tweet (opens in new tab) shows one of the display glasses embedded in a 3D-printed dummy, to give a better impression of what the final product could look like. The dummy only features the display, without buttons, ports or cameras, since it's seemingly designed to show off the screen for third-party companies looking to design screen protectors.\n\nSAP clarifies that the Dynamic Island, visible on all the glass panels, will be offered on all four models in the iPhone 15 family rather than just the more expensive models as it is with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nThis replaces the familiar iPhone notch with two cutouts in the display, joined together on-screen by a black pill-shaped interface that shows currently in-progress activities.\n\nOne big change from previous iPhones is the introduction of a slightly curved bezel, starting about halfway into the black border of the display. That'll match the supposedly curved rear glass of the iPhone 15. But it won't be nearly as curved as a proper curved-edge display such as the one you'd find on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.\n\nDespite this alleged change, the bezel will still apparently be thicker on the non-Pro models, as SAP points out for the display on the right of the pack in the image at the top of this page.\n\nAs with the past few years of iPhones, there will be small or large versions of the basic and Pro models. But unlike previous years, there will be a slight difference between the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro's display sizes, as the former will use a slightly larger 6.2-inch basic model according to recent renders. The iPhone 15 Pro will be 6.1 inches across like the iPhone 14 Pro, while the iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro Max will be 6.7 inches like their predecessors.\n\nWe've still got about half a year to go until Apple actually shows off the newest iPhones, but thanks to the leak-o-sphere, we've got plenty of other alleged details in advance. You can read our iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro hubs for the full rundown.",

However, with reports of Apple's PR team planning a product briefing soon, it's possible that the yellow iPhone 14 could be unveiled at that event. This would follow a similar timeline to the release of the green iPhone 13 models, which were announced in March 2022.",
