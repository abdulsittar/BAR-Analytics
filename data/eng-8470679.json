                    "body": "A deliberate attack on a Russian aircraft in neutral airspace would be an open declaration of war against a nuclear power. This was announced by Russian Ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov.\n\n\"Some lawmakers' calls go far beyond common sense,\" he said, commenting on US Senator Lindsey Graham's (from South Carolina) threats to shoot down Russian planes approaching US aircraft in international airspace.\n\nEarlier, the Russian Defense Ministry published a statement stating that there was no impact between the two aircraft (MQ-9 and Su-27) and that the Reaper drone maneuvered abruptly, losing control and crashing.\n\nThe ministry added that the US drone was flying without transponders and entered airspace that the Russian government had designated as restricted following the start of their special military operations.\n\n\"The Russian aircraft did not use onboard weapons, did not come into contact with the unmanned aerial vehicle, and returned safely to their home airfield,\" the ministry explained.\n\nAccording to Ambassador Antonov, not the Russian pilots but US politicians are inciting the start of an apocalyptic conflict. We do not seek a conflict with nuclear power. We continue to maintain contacts, including through the Ministry of Defense, to prevent unintentional collisions. I would like American politicians to have the same attitude towards relations with Russia,\" the ambassador emphasized.\n\nUkraine became the world's third largest arms importer after Qatar and India in 2022, because of Russia's full-scale invasion last year, according to a recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe SIPRI report compares weapons sales globally between 2013-17 and 2018-22. It shows that Ukraine imported a few major arms from 1991 until the end of 2021.\n\nHowever, \"as a result of military aid from the USA and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) and the 14th biggest for 2018-22,\" the report by SIPRI stated.\n\nThe report noted that the deliveries to Ukraine were mainly second-hand items from existing stocks, including 228 artillery pieces, an estimated 5000 guided artillery rockets from the US, 280 tanks from Poland, and over 7000 anti-tank missiles from the UK.\n\nSome newly produced arms were also delivered to Ukraine, such as air defense systems from Germany, Poland, the UK, and the US. In most cases, one country's supply of these arms was financed by other countries or the European Union (EU) through its European Peace Facility.\n\nFor instance, by the end of 2022, the EU had allocated \u20ac3.1 billion for military equipment for Ukraine, according to SIPRI.\n\nOverall, Ukraine accounted for 2 percent of global arms imports in the five years ending in 2022, as per the estimates by experts at SIPRI.\n\nIt is also essential to bear in mind that the supply of arms to Ukraine from the West has evolved significantly since the start of the conflict in February last year. While initially, the West was reluctant to fulfill Kyiv's requests for main battle tanks (MBTs), Ukraine is now slated to receive various Western-made MBTs like the British Challenger-2s, German-made Leopard-2 tanks, and US-made M1A2 Abrams.\n\nThe Challenger-2s and Leopard-2s are expected to be delivered to Ukraine by the end of March. So, the scope of the military aid to Ukraine and the value thereof is only poised to increase going ahead.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed Kyiv up the world's top arms importers and nearly doubled the arms imports into Europe in 2022. However, a considerable portion of those imports was destined for the war-torn nation.\n\nUkraine alone was the destination for 31 percent of arms shipments to Europe and eight percent of global deliveries in total, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nHowever, the rise in arms imports was, in large part, also driven by an increase in spending by European states, including Poland and Norway, because of the rising threat posed by the Russian aggression in Ukraine, and the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, according to SIPRI.\n\n\"The invasion has caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have a further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nHowever, there was already a surge in arms imports by European countries against the backdrop of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the war in Ukraine only accelerated this trend.\n\nWezeman further said that European countries have either \"already ordered or are planning to\" order weapons ranging from \"submarines to combat aircraft, from drones to anti-tank missiles, from rifles to radars.\"\n\n\"Everything is being looked at because the idea is to strengthen military capacity through the whole spectrum of available military technology,\" he continued.\n\nOver the past five years, the world's top five exporters of arms remained the US at 40 percent of the global arms exports, followed by Russia at 16 percent, then France and China at 11 and 5 percent, respectively, and Germany at 4 percent.\n\nTogether, these countries account for a third of all global exports.\n\nHowever, there has been a sharp decline in the volume of Russian arms exports, particularly in the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, according to SIPRI, which suggests that these export volumes are only likely to decrease as several states decide to move away from Russian arms.\n\nFor instance, India, the largest buyer of Russian arms in 2013-17, imported 37 percent less from Russia between 2018-22.\n\nAlso, multilateral sanctions by the West on Russia, including various trade restrictions and the pressure from the US and its allies on countries not to purchase Russian-made arms, have impaired Moscow's efforts to export arms.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to exacerbate this trend. The conflict will constrain Russia's ability to export arms, as it will probably prioritize the production of arms for its military over those intended for export.",

                    "body": "So dependent has India been on foreign-made weapons that despite a mega push for home-made military equipment under the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliance) initiative, the country still topped the charts when it came to weapons import, unable to shake off a nearly three-decade-old legacy.\n\nAccording to the latest report by reputed think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), released on Monday, India retained the top weapons importer tag with an 11 per cent share of total global arms imports in 2018-22.\n\nThis, despite the fact that Indian imports fell 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 which was attributed to \"India's slow and complex arms procurement process, efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms that are designed and produced domestically.\"\n\nThe latest finding indicates that India has been unable to shake off its discomfiting position since 1993.\n\nThe SIPRI states that the Indian demand for arms is largely driven by \"tensions with Pakistan and China\".\n\nBut certain trends are clearly notable.\n\nBuys from Russia -- historically India's biggest weapons supplier -- fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent from 2013-17 to 2018-22. This has been attributed to \"strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production, and constraints on Russia's arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nOn the other hand, India's military trade with France is booming. It rose 44 per cent in 2018-22 from the 2013-17 period, cornering 11 per cent of the total Indian imports.\n\nIndia was the recipient of 30 per cent of French arms exports -- by far the largest recipient of French arms in 2018-22.\n\nSays the report: \"India's arms imports from France, which included 62 combat aircraft and 4 submarines, increased by 489 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22.\" In the process, France edged out the US to become the second largest supplier to India for the 2018-22 period.\n\nIn India's tense neigbourhood, China accounted for 5.2 per cent of total global arms exports in 2018-22 even as its arms exports decreased by 23 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. But 54 per cent of Chinese weapons had one buyer -- Pakistan.\n\nDespite prevailing economic chaos, Pakistan continued to buy arms and its arms imports grew 14 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 accounting for 3.7 per cent of the global total. About 77 per cent of Pakistani military buys were from one country -- China.\n\nIndian strategists often talk about the threat of a two-front war with a historically belligerent Pakistan on one side and a tumultuous relationship with China on the other.\n\nWhile an uneasy ceasefire with Pakistan has been holding for some time, an ongoing border row with China is showing few signs of being resolved.",

                    "body": "The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published data on global arms transfers on Monday that found India remains the world's largest importer of weapons, reaching a five-year high of 11 percent of all global imports.\n\nSIPRI also crowned India the world's top arms importer in 2022, even after a steep decline over the preceding decade. It lost the title to Saudi Arabia for a few years after the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen began.\n\nImports are trending down because India is trying to become more self-sufficient. The Indian government maintains a separate budget for buying indigenously produced military hardware and has a long list of systems it wishes to begin producing on its own.\n\n\"The Indian military is large and will continue to import weapons and systems for some more years. The decline in India's arms imports is a significant achievement. Imports will drop further as indigenization efforts succeed,\" retired Indian Air Marshal Anil Chopra told the Hindustan Times when the SIPRI report was released.\n\nThe Hindustan Times quoted Indian Chief of Defense Staff Gen. Anil Chauhan warning in early March that India has taken only \"some baby steps toward self-reliance in the last two or three years,\" but remains too dependent on outside suppliers. He predicted the Russia-Ukraine conflict would spur the Indian defense establishment to become more enthusiastic about indigenization.\n\nThe Times of India (TOI) noted on Tuesday that \"a record 75% of the defense capital procurement budget\" was set aside for Indian vendors in 2023-2024. According to the defense ministry, India's procurements from foreign sources have already declined from 46 percent of the defense budget in 2018 to 36.7 percent in 2022.\n\nTOI criticized the government for not devising \"concrete long-term plans to systematically build military capabilities, with proper inter-service prioritization.\" Instead, India has essentially been insisting it would spend less on foreign arms without a cogent plan for stepping up its own production, leaving it short of vital systems for jet fighters, submarines, helicopters, and missiles.\n\nTOI also noted some of the decline in imports tracked by SIPRI was attributed to \"India's slow and complex arms procurement process,\" which was not really something to be proud of.\n\nIndia has long obtained much of its hardware from Russia, but Russian exports are down sharply since it invaded Ukraine a year ago. India is increasing purchases from the United States and France, which actually displaced the U.S. as India's second-largest supplier last year.\n\nSIPRI found French defense companies picking up business worldwide as Russian exports declined to almost every customer except China and Egypt, which both dramatically increased their Russian purchases.\n\nSIPRI said India's rival Pakistan increased arms imports by 14 percent despite a dire economy, with most of the new purchases coming from China.",

                    "body": "France was the second-largest supplier with a 29% share, surpassing the US at 11%. Despite an 11% decline in its total weapons imports, India is still the world's largest arms importer, as per the study conducted by SIPRI.\n\nTo increase domestic production and diversify import sources, Delhi intends to diversify its import portfolio. India's efforts to find new suppliers and promote domestic manufacturing are thought to be the primary reasons for the decrease in Russian imports, according to experts.\n\nAccording to the SIPRI, Russia's status as India's top arms supplier is being \"challenged by strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production,\" and \"constraints on Russia's arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe report discusses the increase in France's defence exports to India between 2013-17 and 2018-22, which saw a rise of 489%.\n\nFrance is now ranked third in the list of global arms exporters, behind the US and Russia but ahead of China and Germany. India's orders to France included approximately 62 combat aircraft and four submarines. The decrease in Russia's share of the Indian arms market coincides with pressure on India to take a tougher stance on the ongoing Ukraine war.\n\nThe relationship between India and Russia has been longstanding, and Moscow has been a reliable ally of India for decades.\n\nThe two countries share a close defence relationship, with the Indian Army equipped with Russian-made tanks and rifles, and the Indian Air Force using Sukhoi fighter jets and Mi-17 helicopters.",

                    "body": "On Monday, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published its latest report of global arms sales, which shows that European states' imports of major arms over the five years between 2018 and 2022 increased by 47 percent compared with that of the 2013-2017 period, while the global arms transfers decreased by 5.1 percent.\n\nDuring the stated period, arms imports in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and the Middle East fell by 40 percent, 21 percent, 7.5 percent and 8.8 percent respectively.\n\nIn the meantime, European North Atlantic Treaty Organization states increased their arms imports by 65 percent mainly due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe report also said that the U.S. dominance of the global arms trade increased, as its share of global arms exports surged from 33 percent to 40 percent while Russia's share fell from 22 percent to 16 percent.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea, Japan and Australia's arms imports soared 61 percent, 171 percent and 23 percent respectively, with the U.S. as the main supplier to the three countries. In the Middle East, the largest arms supplier is also the U.S., providing 54 percent of the region's arms imports.\n\nAs a result of military aid from the U.S. and many European states following the crisis in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.",

                    "body": "The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has released data showing that NATO members US and France were responsible for more than half of all heavy weapons supplied worldwide in the period between 2018 and 2022. The data was released by SIPRI on Monday, March 13.\n\nAs per the data, major European countries, mostly NATO members, increased their arms imports by 47%, in a period when the rest of the world, particularly the countries of the Global South, witnessed a significant decline (5.1%).\n\nEast Asia and Oceania were the only other regions, apart from Europe, that registered an overall increase in arms imports by 21% and 25%, respectively, in the 2018-22 period. Within these regions, Japan registered the sharpest increase in arms imports (171%), followed by South Korea (61%), and Australia (23%). All three countries are major US allies.\n\nChina, the largest country in the East Asian region and the world's second largest economy as well, witnessed an increase in arms imports in the said period, however, of just 4%.\n\nMost countries in Africa (-40%), Latin America (-21%), and the Middle East (-8.8%) registered a significant decline in arms imports in the 2018-22 period, in comparison to 2013-17.\n\nCounted together, Asia and Oceania remained the largest importer of heavy weapons in the world, with a share of over 41%. However, because some sub-regions (such as South-East Asia) registered a sharp decline (-42%), the overall region also registered a slight decline in arms import by 7.5% over the same period.\n\nThe latest SIPRI data shows that West Asia, which still has some of the largest importers of weapons in the world, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, registering a significant decline in weapons imports by close to 9% in 2018-22 period.\n\nAmong the major arms importers, India retains its position of being the largest buyer of heavy arms (11% of all global imports) in the world in the period 2018-22. Saudi Arabia (9.6%) was the second and Qatar (6.4%) was the third-largest.\n\nAccording to the SIPRI data, major NATO countries, the US (40%), France (11%), Germany (4.2%), Italy (3.8%), the UK (3.2%) and Spain (2.6%) amounted to nearly two-third of all arms exports in the world in the 2018-22 period.\n\nRussia, which still retains the second position in global arms exports, has seen a massive decline in its share in global exports recently, with its share falling from 22% to just 16%.\n\nThe decline in Russian arms exports is mostly due to the sanctions imposed by the US and its European allies following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. Fresh rounds of sanctions, intimidation by the US and NATO, and the beginning of the war in Ukraine last year may further decrease the Russian share in global arms export, a SIPRI press release notes.\n\nThe US share in global arms exports increased from 33% to 40% in the same period, and its ally France, the third-largest exporter of weapons, was also a significant beneficiary, with its share increasing from roughly 7.1% to 11%.\n\nMost fresh weapons supplies are done to regions where there is an active conflict, such as the Middle East (Yemen war), or regions where the US and the west have been involved in diplomatic or economic conflicts. This includes East Asia, where there has been an increasing emphasis on the so-called \"threat from China.\"\n\nSIPRI data shows that there is a growing race to arm countries in East Asia and Oceania by the US and its allies. In most cases, they are the only suppliers of weapons to Japan, South Korea, and Australia.\n\nSIPRI also notes that 80% of all arms sold to the Middle East region come from the US (54%) and other NATO countries such as France (12%) and Italy (8.4%).\n\nfrom https://scheerpost.com/2023/03/15/us-and-nato-allies-were-responsible-for-nearly-65-of-global-arms-exports-in-2018-22/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=us-and-nato-allies-were-responsible-for-nearly-65-of-global-arms-exports-in-2018-22",

This raises the question: 'what has come out of India's desire to achieve self-sufficiency in production of defence equipment'? The answer lies in understanding the multiple issues that are related to the subject, such as India's threats from neighbours like China and Pakistan, the historical legacy of arms imports from Russia and the diplomatic pressures on India from the arms lobbies in the US. But before we look at these factors, we would also need to admit that India's inability to develop a robust defence-industrial base can be attributed to the Ministry of Defence still patronising the DRDO, defence PSUs, and ordnance factories and limiting the role of private sector involvement.",

                    "title": "German arms industry seeks clarity on Ukraine weapons orders",
                    "body": "FILE - German soldiers stand with guns and bazookas at the army base Field Marshal Rommel Barracks in Augustdorf, Germany, Wednesday, March 30, 2022. Germany's defense industry says it stands ready to supply Ukraine with much-needed arms and ammunition, but needs clarity about what the country requires before investing in further production capacity.\n\nBERLIN (AP) -- Germany's defense industry says it stands ready to ramp up its output, including the kinds of arms and ammunition needed by Ukraine, but needs clarity about what governments want before investing in further production capacity.\n\nUkraine became the world's third largest importer of arms in 2022 after Russia's invasion triggered a big flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe, according to Swedish think tank SIPRI.\n\nSome of those arms were transferred from Western military stocks to Ukraine, while in other cases Kyiv has purchased equipment with its own money or funds provided by allies. But there are concerns particularly over the rate at which Ukraine is using ammunition, straining the capacity of Western defense companies to keep both the Ukrainian military and their own resupplied.\n\n\"What's important for us as an industry is to get predictability,\" the head of Germany's arms manufacturing association said in an interview this week with The Associated Press.\n\n\"That means we have to be clearly told which products are needed within which time,\" said Hans Christoph Atzpodien, managing director of the Federation of German Security and Defense Industries.\n\n\"And we are prepared,\" he added. \"The industry is much more flexible than it is given credit for.\"\n\nThe association's members, which include major arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall, can further boost production, such as by reactivating mothballed facilities and machines, and hiring more staff, he said.\n\n\"Of course we also need a firm basis in the form of orders, so that the investments can be carried out,\" said Atzpodien, adding that proposals to bundle purchases at the European rather than the national level could help -- provided this doesn't slow down the procurement process.\n\nLikewise, German arms manufacturers are keen to see European countries harmonize their export rules to avoid being disadvantaged compared with competitors in some neighboring countries, he said.\n\nAfter initially hesitating to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, Germany has become one of Kyiv's biggest arms suppliers. The shift has already seen Berlin provide Ukraine with dozens of self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Iris-T missile systems, howitzers and millions of rounds of ammunition, but left some Germans deeply uneasy about the possibility of being dragged into a conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nStill, Atzpodien said the final decision on where German-made arms can go should remain a matter for the government.\n\n\"As companies we agree that German weapons must never fall into the wrong hands,\" he said.\n\nThe German government declined to comment Monday on reports that Rheinmetall is in talks with Ukraine about building a tank factory in the country. The company's Leopard 2 tanks are urgently sought by Ukraine, which was recently promised several dozen from Western stocks, but officials wouldn't say whether this requires government approval.\n\nGermany's own arms procurement has come under scrutiny after Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged last year to increase defense spending to NATO's target of 2% of GDP and create a 100-billion-euro ($107 billion) special fund.\n\nOn Tuesday, parliament's commissioner for the military lamented the slow pace of Germany's drive to modernize its armed forces. She noted that none of the 100 billion-euro special fund was actually spent last year, though some major orders were placed.\n\n\"It is also important to quickly replace equipment that was given to Ukraine\" and to speed up maintenance of existing equipment, Eva Hoegl said as she presented her annual report.\n\n\"The Bundeswehr has too little of everything, and even less since Feb. 24 (2022),\" she said. \"We have too few tanks to be able to train sufficiently, to exercise ... boats and ships are lacking, aircraft are lacking.\"\n\nAlong with the cash coming its way because of the war in Ukraine -- Germany's defense minister is also seeking to raise his budget by 10 billion euros a year -- the German arms industry is hoping the conflict will mark a turning point in the way military spending is classified in Europe.\n\nSome banks and investors in the European Union won't do business with the defense sector because of concerns that it is engaged in unsustainable activity that does more harm than good in the long run, much like fossil fuel producers.\n\nRussia's attack on Ukraine had shown the value of military security, said Atzpodien.\n\n\"Our demand is that products we deliver to the German military or other NATO armed forces, for example, are recognized in such a way by the EU that they support sustainability,\" he said. \"A signal like that would be important so that actors on the financial markets can adjust to it accordingly.\"\n\nGerman arms manufacturers have already come up with a slogan to push their case, he added: \"Security is the key to sustainability.\"\n\nGeir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",

                    "title": "German arms industry seeks clarity on Ukraine weapons orders",
                    "body": "BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's defense industry says it stands ready to ramp up its output, including the kinds of arms and ammunition needed by Ukraine, but needs clarity about what governments want before investing in further production capacity.\n\nUkraine became the world's third largest importer of arms in 2022 after Russia's invasion triggered a big flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe, according to Swedish think tank SIPRI.\n\nSome of those arms were transferred from Western military stocks to Ukraine, while in other cases Kyiv has purchased equipment with its own money or funds provided by allies. But there are concerns particularly over the rate at which Ukraine is using ammunition, straining the capacity of Western defense companies to keep both the Ukrainian military and their own resupplied.\n\n\"What's important for us as an industry is to get predictability,\" the head of Germany's arms manufacturing association said in an interview this week with The Associated Press.\n\n\"That means we have to be clearly told which products are needed within which time,\" said Hans Christoph Atzpodien, managing director of the Federation of German Security and Defense Industries.\n\n\"And we are prepared,\" he added. \"The industry is much more flexible than it is given credit for.\"\n\nThe association's members, which include major arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall, can further boost production, such as by reactivating mothballed facilities and machines, and hiring more staff, he said.\n\n\"Of course we also need a firm basis in the form of orders, so that the investments can be carried out,\" said Atzpodien, adding that proposals to bundle purchases at the European rather than the national level could help -- provided this doesn't slow down the procurement process.\n\nLikewise, German arms manufacturers are keen to see European countries harmonize their export rules to avoid being disadvantaged compared with competitors in some neighboring countries, he said.\n\nAfter initially hesitating to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, Germany has become one of Kyiv's biggest arms suppliers. The shift has already seen Berlin provide Ukraine with dozens of self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Iris-T missile systems, howitzers and millions of rounds of ammunition, but left some Germans deeply uneasy about the possibility of being dragged into a conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nStill, Atzpodien said the final decision on where German-made arms can go should remain a matter for the government.\n\n\"As companies we agree that German weapons must never fall into the wrong hands,\" he said.\n\nThe German government declined to comment Monday on reports that Rheinmetall is in talks with Ukraine about building a tank factory in the country. The company's Leopard 2 tanks are urgently sought by Ukraine, which was recently promised several dozen from Western stocks, but officials wouldn't say whether this requires government approval.\n\nGermany's own arms procurement has come under scrutiny after Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged last year to increase defense spending to NATO's target of 2% of GDP and create a 100-billion-euro ($107 billion) special fund.\n\nOn Tuesday, parliament's commissioner for the military lamented the slow pace of Germany's drive to modernize its armed forces. She noted that none of the 100 billion-euro special fund was actually spent last year, though some major orders were placed.\n\n\"It is also important to quickly replace equipment that was given to Ukraine\" and to speed up maintenance of existing equipment, Eva Hoegl said as she presented her annual report.\n\n\"The Bundeswehr has too little of everything, and even less since Feb. 24 (2022),\" she said. \"We have too few tanks to be able to train sufficiently, to exercise ... boats and ships are lacking, aircraft are lacking.\"\n\nAlong with the cash coming its way because of the war in Ukraine -- Germany's defense minister is also seeking to raise his budget by 10 billion euros a year -- the German arms industry is hoping the conflict will mark a turning point in the way military spending is classified in Europe.\n\nSome banks and investors in the European Union won't do business with the defense sector because of concerns that it is engaged in unsustainable activity that does more harm than good in the long run, much like fossil fuel producers.\n\nRussia's attack on Ukraine had shown the value of military security, said Atzpodien.\n\n\"Our demand is that products we deliver to the German military or other NATO armed forces, for example, are recognized in such a way by the EU that they support sustainability,\" he said. \"A signal like that would be important so that actors on the financial markets can adjust to it accordingly.\"\n\nGerman arms manufacturers have already come up with a slogan to push their case, he added: \"Security is the key to sustainability.\"\n\nGeir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.\n\nSubscribe Get Unlimited Access $3 for 3 Months Subscribe Now\n\nSupport local journalism reporting on your community\n\n* New Subscribers Only\n\n* Digital Subscription Only\n\nAfter the initial selected subscription period your subscription rate will auto renew at $12.00 per month.",

                    "body": "BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's defense industry says it stands ready to ramp up its output, including the kinds of arms and ammunition needed by Ukraine, but needs clarity about what governments want before investing in further production capacity.\n\nUkraine became the world's third largest importer of arms in 2022 after Russia's invasion triggered a big flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe, according to Swedish think tank SIPRI.\n\nSome of those arms were transferred from Western military stocks to Ukraine, while in other cases Kyiv has purchased equipment with its own money or funds provided by allies. But there are concerns particularly over the rate at which Ukraine is using ammunition, straining the capacity of Western defense companies to keep both the Ukrainian military and their own resupplied.\n\n\"What's important for us as an industry is to get predictability,\" the head of Germany's arms manufacturing association said in an interview this week with The Associated Press.\n\n\"That means we have to be clearly told which products are needed within which time,\" said Hans Christoph Atzpodien, managing director of the Federation of German Security and Defense Industries.\n\n\"And we are prepared,\" he added. \"The industry is much more flexible than it is given credit for.\"\n\nThe association's members, which include major arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall, can further boost production, such as by reactivating mothballed facilities and machines, and hiring more staff, he said.\n\n\"Of course we also need a firm basis in the form of orders, so that the investments can be carried out,\" said Atzpodien, adding that proposals to bundle purchases at the European rather than the national level could help -- provided this doesn't slow down the procurement process.\n\nLikewise, German arms manufacturers are keen to see European countries harmonize their export rules to avoid being disadvantaged compared with competitors in some neighboring countries, he said.\n\nAfter initially hesitating to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, Germany has become one of Kyiv's biggest arms suppliers. The shift has already seen Berlin provide Ukraine with dozens of self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Iris-T missile systems, howitzers and millions of rounds of ammunition, but left some Germans deeply uneasy about the possibility of being dragged into a conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nStill, Atzpodien said the final decision on where German-made arms can go should remain a matter for the government.\n\n\"As companies we agree that German weapons must never fall into the wrong hands,\" he said.\n\nThe German government declined to comment Monday on reports that Rheinmetall is in talks with Ukraine about building a tank factory in the country. The company's Leopard 2 tanks are urgently sought by Ukraine, which was recently promised several dozen from Western stocks, but officials wouldn't say whether this requires government approval.\n\nGermany's own arms procurement has come under scrutiny after Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged last year to increase defense spending to NATO's target of 2% of GDP and create a 100-billion-euro ($107 billion) special fund.\n\nOn Tuesday, parliament's commissioner for the military lamented the slow pace of Germany's drive to modernize its armed forces. She noted that none of the 100 billion-euro special fund was actually spent last year, though some major orders were placed.\n\n\"It is also important to quickly replace equipment that was given to Ukraine\" and to speed up maintenance of existing equipment, Eva Hoegl said as she presented her annual report.\n\n\"The Bundeswehr has too little of everything, and even less since Feb. 24 (2022),\" she said. \"We have too few tanks to be able to train sufficiently, to exercise ... boats and ships are lacking, aircraft are lacking.\"\n\nAlong with the cash coming its way because of the war in Ukraine -- Germany's defense minister is also seeking to raise his budget by 10 billion euros a year -- the German arms industry is hoping the conflict will mark a turning point in the way military spending is classified in Europe.\n\nSome banks and investors in the European Union won't do business with the defense sector because of concerns that it is engaged in unsustainable activity that does more harm than good in the long run, much like fossil fuel producers.\n\nRussia's attack on Ukraine had shown the value of military security, said Atzpodien.\n\n\"Our demand is that products we deliver to the German military or other NATO armed forces, for example, are recognized in such a way by the EU that they support sustainability,\" he said. \"A signal like that would be important so that actors on the financial markets can adjust to it accordingly.\"\n\nGerman arms manufacturers have already come up with a slogan to push their case, he added: \"Security is the key to sustainability.\"\n\n___\n\nGeir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",

                    "title": "German arms industry seeks clarity on Ukraine weapons orders",
                    "body": "Ukraine became the world's third largest importer of arms in 2022 after Russia's invasion triggered a big flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe, according to Swedish think tank SIPRI.\n\nSome of those arms were transferred from Western military stocks to Ukraine, while in other cases Kyiv has purchased equipment with its own money or funds provided by allies. But there are concerns particularly over the rate at which Ukraine is using ammunition, straining the capacity of Western defense companies to keep both the Ukrainian military and their own resupplied.\n\n\"What's important for us as an industry is to get predictability,\" the head of Germany's arms manufacturing association said in an interview this week with The Associated Press.\n\n\"That means we have to be clearly told which products are needed within which time,\" said Hans Christoph Atzpodien, managing director of the Federation of German Security and Defense Industries.\n\n\"And we are prepared,\" he added. \"The industry is much more flexible than it is given credit for.\"\n\nThe association's members, which include major arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall, can further boost production, such as by reactivating mothballed facilities and machines, and hiring more staff, he said.\n\n\"Of course we also need a firm basis in the form of orders, so that the investments can be carried out,\" said Atzpodien, adding that proposals to bundle purchases at the European rather than the national level could help -- provided this doesn't slow down the procurement process.\n\nLikewise, German arms manufacturers are keen to see European countries harmonize their export rules to avoid being disadvantaged compared with competitors in some neighboring countries, he said.\n\nAfter initially hesitating to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, Germany has become one of Kyiv's biggest arms suppliers. The shift has already seen Berlin provide Ukraine with dozens of self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Iris-T missile systems, howitzers and millions of rounds of ammunition, but left some Germans deeply uneasy about the possibility of being dragged into a conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nStill, Atzpodien said the final decision on where German-made arms can go should remain a matter for the government.\n\n\"As companies we agree that German weapons must never fall into the wrong hands,\" he said.\n\nThe German government declined to comment Monday on reports that Rheinmetall is in talks with Ukraine about building a tank factory in the country. The company's Leopard 2 tanks are urgently sought by Ukraine, which was recently promised several dozen from Western stocks, but officials wouldn't say whether this requires government approval.\n\nGermany's own arms procurement has come under scrutiny after Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged last year to increase defense spending to NATO's target of 2% of GDP and create a 100-billion-euro ($107 billion) special fund.\n\nOn Tuesday, parliament's commissioner for the military lamented the slow pace of Germany's drive to modernize its armed forces. She noted that none of the 100 billion-euro special fund was actually spent last year, though some major orders were placed.\n\n\"It is also important to quickly replace equipment that was given to Ukraine\" and to speed up maintenance of existing equipment, Eva Hoegl said as she presented her annual report.\n\n\"The Bundeswehr has too little of everything, and even less since Feb. 24 (2022),\" she said. \"We have too few tanks to be able to train sufficiently, to exercise ... boats and ships are lacking, aircraft are lacking.\"\n\nAlong with the cash coming its way because of the war in Ukraine -- Germany's defense minister is also seeking to raise his budget by 10 billion euros a year -- the German arms industry is hoping the conflict will mark a turning point in the way military spending is classified in Europe.\n\nSome banks and investors in the European Union won't do business with the defense sector because of concerns that it is engaged in unsustainable activity that does more harm than good in the long run, much like fossil fuel producers.\n\nRussia's attack on Ukraine had shown the value of military security, said Atzpodien.\n\n\"Our demand is that products we deliver to the German military or other NATO armed forces, for example, are recognized in such a way by the EU that they support sustainability,\" he said. \"A signal like that would be important so that actors on the financial markets can adjust to it accordingly.\"\n\nGerman arms manufacturers have already come up with a slogan to push their case, he added: \"Security is the key to sustainability.\"\n\nGeir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",

                    "title": "German arms industry seeks clarity on Ukraine weapons orders",
                    "body": "Ukraine became the world's third largest importer of arms in 2022 after Russia's invasion triggered a big flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe, according to Swedish think tank SIPRI.\n\nSome of those arms were transferred from Western military stocks to Ukraine, while in other cases Kyiv has purchased equipment with its own money or funds provided by allies. But there are concerns particularly over the rate at which Ukraine is using ammunition, straining the capacity of Western defense companies to keep both the Ukrainian military and their own resupplied.\n\n\"What's important for us as an industry is to get predictability,\" the head of Germany's arms manufacturing association said in an interview this week with The Associated Press.\n\n\"That means we have to be clearly told which products are needed within which time,\" said Hans Christoph Atzpodien, managing director of the Federation of German Security and Defense Industries.\n\n\"And we are prepared,\" he added. \"The industry is much more flexible than it is given credit for.\"\n\nThe association's members, which include major arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall, can further boost production, such as by reactivating mothballed facilities and machines, and hiring more staff, he said.\n\n\"Of course we also need a firm basis in the form of orders, so that the investments can be carried out,\" said Atzpodien, adding that proposals to bundle purchases at the European rather than the national level could help -- provided this doesn't slow down the procurement process.\n\nLikewise, German arms manufacturers are keen to see European countries harmonize their export rules to avoid being disadvantaged compared with competitors in some neighboring countries, he said.\n\nAfter initially hesitating to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, Germany has become one of Kyiv's biggest arms suppliers. The shift has already seen Berlin provide Ukraine with dozens of self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Iris-T missile systems, howitzers and millions of rounds of ammunition, but left some Germans deeply uneasy about the possibility of being dragged into a conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nStill, Atzpodien said the final decision on where German-made arms can go should remain a matter for the government.\n\n\"As companies we agree that German weapons must never fall into the wrong hands,\" he said.\n\nThe German government declined to comment Monday on reports that Rheinmetall is in talks with Ukraine about building a tank factory in the country. The company's Leopard 2 tanks are urgently sought by Ukraine, which was recently promised several dozen from Western stocks, but officials wouldn't say whether this requires government approval.\n\nGermany's own arms procurement has come under scrutiny after Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged last year to increase defense spending to NATO's target of 2% of GDP and create a 100-billion-euro ($107 billion) special fund.\n\nOn Tuesday, parliament's commissioner for the military lamented the slow pace of Germany's drive to modernize its armed forces. She noted that none of the 100 billion-euro special fund was actually spent last year, though some major orders were placed.\n\n\"It is also important to quickly replace equipment that was given to Ukraine\" and to speed up maintenance of existing equipment, Eva Hoegl said as she presented her annual report.\n\n\"The Bundeswehr has too little of everything, and even less since Feb. 24 (2022),\" she said. \"We have too few tanks to be able to train sufficiently, to exercise ... boats and ships are lacking, aircraft are lacking.\"\n\nAlong with the cash coming its way because of the war in Ukraine -- Germany's defense minister is also seeking to raise his budget by 10 billion euros a year -- the German arms industry is hoping the conflict will mark a turning point in the way military spending is classified in Europe.\n\nSome banks and investors in the European Union won't do business with the defense sector because of concerns that it is engaged in unsustainable activity that does more harm than good in the long run, much like fossil fuel producers.\n\nRussia's attack on Ukraine had shown the value of military security, said Atzpodien.\n\n\"Our demand is that products we deliver to the German military or other NATO armed forces, for example, are recognized in such a way by the EU that they support sustainability,\" he said. \"A signal like that would be important so that actors on the financial markets can adjust to it accordingly.\"\n\nGerman arms manufacturers have already come up with a slogan to push their case, he added: \"Security is the key to sustainability.\"\n\nGeir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",

                    "title": "German arms industry seeks clarity on Ukraine weapons orders",
                    "body": "BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's defense industry says it stands ready to ramp up its output, including the kinds of arms and ammunition needed by Ukraine, but needs clarity about what governments want before investing in further production capacity.\n\nUkraine became the world's third largest importer of arms in 2022 after Russia's invasion triggered a big flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe, according to Swedish think tank SIPRI.\n\nSome of those arms were transferred from Western military stocks to Ukraine, while in other cases Kyiv has purchased equipment with its own money or funds provided by allies. But there are concerns particularly over the rate at which Ukraine is using ammunition, straining the capacity of Western defense companies to keep both the Ukrainian military and their own resupplied.\n\n\"What's important for us as an industry is to get predictability,\" the head of Germany's arms manufacturing association said in an interview this week with The Associated Press.\n\n\"That means we have to be clearly told which products are needed within which time,\" said Hans Christoph Atzpodien, managing director of the Federation of German Security and Defense Industries.\n\n\"And we are prepared,\" he added. \"The industry is much more flexible than it is given credit for.\"\n\nThe association's members, which include major arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall, can further boost production, such as by reactivating mothballed facilities and machines, and hiring more staff, he said.\n\n\"Of course we also need a firm basis in the form of orders, so that the investments can be carried out,\" said Atzpodien, adding that proposals to bundle purchases at the European rather than the national level could help -- provided this doesn't slow down the procurement process.\n\nLikewise, German arms manufacturers are keen to see European countries harmonize their export rules to avoid being disadvantaged compared with competitors in some neighboring countries, he said.\n\nAfter initially hesitating to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, Germany has become one of Kyiv's biggest arms suppliers. The shift has already seen Berlin provide Ukraine with dozens of self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Iris-T missile systems, howitzers and millions of rounds of ammunition, but left some Germans deeply uneasy about the possibility of being dragged into a conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nStill, Atzpodien said the final decision on where German-made arms can go should remain a matter for the government.\n\n\"As companies we agree that German weapons must never fall into the wrong hands,\" he said.\n\nThe German government declined to comment Monday on reports that Rheinmetall is in talks with Ukraine about building a tank factory in the country. The company's Leopard 2 tanks are urgently sought by Ukraine, which was recently promised several dozen from Western stocks, but officials wouldn't say whether this requires government approval.\n\nGermany's own arms procurement has come under scrutiny after Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged last year to increase defense spending to NATO's target of 2% of GDP and create a 100-billion-euro ($107 billion) special fund.\n\nOn Tuesday, parliament's commissioner for the military lamented the slow pace of Germany's drive to modernize its armed forces. She noted that none of the 100 billion-euro special fund was actually spent last year, though some major orders were placed.\n\n\"It is also important to quickly replace equipment that was given to Ukraine\" and to speed up maintenance of existing equipment, Eva Hoegl said as she presented her annual report.\n\n\"The Bundeswehr has too little of everything, and even less since Feb. 24 (2022),\" she said. \"We have too few tanks to be able to train sufficiently, to exercise ... boats and ships are lacking, aircraft are lacking.\"\n\nAlong with the cash coming its way because of the war in Ukraine -- Germany's defense minister is also seeking to raise his budget by 10 billion euros a year -- the German arms industry is hoping the conflict will mark a turning point in the way military spending is classified in Europe.\n\nSome banks and investors in the European Union won't do business with the defense sector because of concerns that it is engaged in unsustainable activity that does more harm than good in the long run, much like fossil fuel producers.\n\nRussia's attack on Ukraine had shown the value of military security, said Atzpodien.\n\n\"Our demand is that products we deliver to the German military or other NATO armed forces, for example, are recognized in such a way by the EU that they support sustainability,\" he said. \"A signal like that would be important so that actors on the financial markets can adjust to it accordingly.\"\n\nGerman arms manufacturers have already come up with a slogan to push their case, he added: \"Security is the key to sustainability.\"\n\n___\n\nGeir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",

But there are concerns particularly over the rate at which Ukraine is using ammunition, straining the capacity of Western defense companies to keep both the Ukrainian military and their own resupplied.",

                    "title": "IntelBrief: Ukraine War Erodes Russian Arms Sales",
                    "body": "Some of Moscow's arms customers are weighing their need for Russian weapons against the potential for U.S. and European sanctions for cooperation with the Russian defense industry.\n\nSales of sophisticated conventional weapons have long been a key pillar of the Russian economy as well as a mainstay of its image as a global superpower. Russia was the world's third-largest arms exporter in 2021 following the United States and France, falling from its number-two spot the prior year, according to a database by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Russia's conditions for agreeing to arms sales are far less stringent than those of the United States or the European countries, a factor that has historically attracted a wide range of buyers among authoritarian states with generally poor human rights records. China, Egypt, Algeria and India are the top foreign customers of Russian weapons.\n\nHowever, Russia's share of the global arms market fell from 24% during the four-year period of 2012-2016 to less than 20% during the 2017-2021 period. India - not only one of Russia's largest arms customers, but also the number-one major arms importer in the world - began reducing its reliance on Russian weaponry long before the Ukraine invasion, decreasing its imports by 47% since the 2012-2016 period. China has developed a large indigenous arms industry whose sophistication sometimes exceeds that of Russia, particularly when it comes to advanced combat aircraft. Yet while China may boast a more diverse weapons supply today, it still increased its Russian arms imports by 60% between 2012-2016 and 2017-2021.\n\nAs for India, as relations and strategic interest alignment between New Delhi and the West have improved in recent years, the country has increasingly turned towards the United States and France to help equip its armed forces. Another significant customer of Russian arms, Vietnam, has been diversifying its arms providers and expanding its domestic production of weaponry (such as grenade launchers, anti-tank weapons, and small arms) while reducing imports of Russian arms by 71 percent since the 2012-2016 period. While Iran is emerging as a significant defense partner for Moscow, it is believed to be trading its armed drones and ballistic missiles for Russia's Su-35 combat aircraft and other equipment, an arrangement that will not yield Moscow cash proceeds.\n\nIn addition to the longer-term trends working against Russian arms exports, there is little dispute that the invasion of Ukraine has caused some customers to downsize their defense cooperation with Moscow. While arms sales brought Russia $14.16 billion in revenue in 2021, according to the head of the government's Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, the head of Russia's arms export agency projected its 2022 revenues would decrease to $10.8 billion. Nine months after the Ukraine invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the country's yearly arms export stood at $8 billion. Some of this decline can almost certainly be attributed to the exigencies of the war effort: while Putin expected a quick victory in Ukraine, the prolonged conflict has seen the country allocate much of its weapons production capacity merely to sustaining its forces in Ukraine, leaving far less available for export.\n\nAside from production capacity constraints, some world leaders are hesitant to place new weapons orders from Moscow in solidarity with the United States and European countries' opposition to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Others, such as India, continue to engage Moscow in part to satisfy their need for steady weapons supplies. Yet no leader or defense official can easily ignore the poor performance of the Russian military in Ukraine when considering a new arms purchase. In particular, a significant money-earner for Moscow's defense industry is combat aircraft, and Russia has failed to gain air superiority over Ukraine. British intelligence estimated that Russia had lost over a quarter of its Ka-52 helicopters less than a year into the war, undermining the system's reputation. Russia's most modern tank fleet has also proven highly vulnerable to Western-supplied portable anti-tank weaponry.\n\nComments by defense strategists in India suggest that New Delhi's defense establishment has begun to question whether Russian weaponry can meet the country's requirements to defend itself against adversaries like China and Pakistan. Still, neither India nor other major buyers such as Algeria and Vietnam are in a position to immediately shift to alternate suppliers, and will likely continue to submit orders for new weapons from Moscow for years to come. Some global defense experts have defended the quality of Russian-made arms, arguing that their failures in Ukraine are due more to the poor training, command and control, and morale of the Russian forces.\n\nBeyond the political and operational risks of continued defense cooperation with Moscow, some arms buyers are deterred by the potential for U.S. and Western economic retaliation. Since well before the Ukraine invasion, the United States has proved willing to impose sanctions on countries that buy Russian arms it deems a potential threat to U.S. national security. A provision of the 2017 Countering America' Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) imposes sanctions on any entity that \" engages in a significant transaction with a person that is part of, or operates for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors of\" the Russian government.\n\nIn December 2020, the United States sanctions its NATO ally T\u00fcrkiye after the institution responsible for managing the Turkish arms supply procured the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system. These sanctions included a ban on all U.S. export licenses and authorizations to the institution and an asset freeze and visa restrictions on its officers. Separately, the United States also suspended T\u00fcrkiye's participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Aside from imposing actual sanctions, U.S officials have cited CAATSA to warn officials in the Persian Gulf states - all of which are U.S. partners - not to proceed with purchases of sophisticated Russian weaponry, particularly the S-400. The threat of U.S. sanctions has, according to many defense experts, hindered the ability of the Kremlin to win at least some new arms contracts. In the context of the Ukraine war, governments already inclined to reduce their Russia arms buys can use CAATSA and other U.S. sanctions authorities to justify a decision not to proceed with new weapons orders.",

                    "body": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in countries increasing their arms imports due to running tensions with Moscow. A report by a Sweden-based think tank found that Kyiv has become the world's third-largest arms importer.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute published a report on Monday that found that European countries increased their arms imports by 47 percent in a five-year period from 2018 to 2022. The report added that the larger increase in arms imports came from NATO member countries, increasing their imports of major weapons by 65 percent in the same timeframe.\n\nDespite the increases in Europe, global arms imports declined by 5.1 percent. The United States, South Korea, and France were the biggest suppliers to NATO countries in Europe in the past five years. Poland, Germany, the US, and the United Kingdom are the biggest suppliers of major arms to Ukraine following Russia's invasion last year.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said SIPRI Arms Transfers Program senior researcher Pieter D. Wezeman. \"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms faster.\"\n\nMany of the arms that are being supplied to Ukraine are second-hand items from existing stockpiles, according to the report. This includes around 228 artillery pieces and around 5,000 guided artillery rockets from the United States, 280 tanks from Poland, and over 7,000 anti-tank missiles from the United Kingdom. The report also said the war also had a limited impact on the total volume of arms in the past five years.\n\nMeanwhile, the fighting continues at the key city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, and the British defense ministry said Russian forces are experiencing a worsening shortage of artillery ammunition. The situation, according to the ministry, has worsened to the extent that several Russian forces on the front lines have resorted to rationing their shells. The ministry said that this might likely be the reason why Russia has not been able to succeed in its operational offensives in the region.\n\nThe ministry said that Moscow appears to be turning to using old ammunition that has previously been declared unfit for use on the battlefield.",

                    "body": "Click here to get Khmer Times Breaking News direct into your Telegram\n\nArms imports into Europe almost doubled in 2022, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said on Monday.\n\nWith a 93 per cent jump compared with 2021, imports also increased because of accelerating military spending by European states, including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Mr Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at Sipri, told AFP.\n\nUkraine was until 2022 a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 per cent of arms transfers to Europe and 8 per cent of world deliveries overall, according to Sipri's data.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than sixtyfold in 2022, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the United States; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, Sipri said.\n\n'Whole spectrum'\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to put a dollar value to it as many contracts are opaque, the global arms trade totals more than $100 billion a year, and Sipri said in 2022 that total military expenditure had exceeded US$2 trillion for the first time.\n\nEstimated military expenditure for 2022 by will be released by Sipri in April.\n\nThe surge in imports to Ukraine accelerated an already rising trend, as European states had already begun re-arming in the light of rising tension with Moscow following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nEuropean states have either \"already ordered or are planning to\" order weapons ranging from \"submarines to combat aircraft, from drones to anti-tank missiles, from rifles to radars\", Mr Wezeman said.\n\n\"Everything is being looked at, because the idea is to strengthen military capacity through the whole spectrum of available military technology.\"\n\nSipri prefers to analyse trends over half-decades as a few contracts can tilt yearly figures.\n\nOver the last five years (2018 to 2022), European imports have increased by 47 per cent compared with the previous five years, while world transfers have declined by 5 per cent, it said.\n\nImports dropping elsewhere\n\nUnlike Europe, all other continents have seen a decline in imports over the last five years.\n\nThere was a marked drop in Africa (minus 40 per cent) and in North and South America (minus 20 per cent), and declines as well in Asia (minus 7 per cent) and the Middle East (minus 9 per cent).\n\nIn another major shift, the Middle East became the leading destination for arms exports over the past year, accounting for 32 per cent of the world total.\n\nIt jumped ahead of Asia-Oceania, which was in first place for years but fell to second in 2022 with 30 per cent of the total, and with Europe closing in with 27 per cent.\n\nChina is continuing to spend heavily on its military but is increasingly producing its weapons locally, which leads to reduced exports to Asia, Sipri said.\n\nThe main destinations for arms transfers were Qatar (10 per cent of the world total), India (9 per cent) and Ukraine (8 per cent), followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (7 per cent each), and Pakistan (5 per cent).\n\nThe world's top five exporters over the past five years remained the United States (40 per cent); Russia (16 per cent); France (11 per cent); China (5 per cent); and Germany (4 per cent).\n\nTogether, they account for three-quarters of all world exports. However, while the US and French shares have increased significantly, those of the other three have declined. AFP",

                    "body": "India remained the world's top arms importer, but its imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, according to a Stockholm-based defence think tank.\n\nThe decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs, a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report said on Monday (13).\n\nIt said the five largest arms importers in the world during 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China. The five largest arms exporters were the US, Russia, France, China and Germany.\n\nThe imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth-largest arms importer during 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier, the report said.\n\nIt said France's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and most of these exports were to countries in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East.\n\nThe report said India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports during 2018-22 and France displaced the US as the second-largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India for example,\" said Pieter D Wezeman, a senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\n\"This seems likely to continue as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,\" he said.\n\nThe report compared two five-year periods and noted that Russian arms supplies to India are declining. It said the US' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent, while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Wezeman.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,\" he added.",

                    "body": "Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper praises the project and reacts to President Xi and Zelenskyy's plan to speak.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday will travel to Ethiopia and then Niger later in the week as the Biden administration looks to bolster relations with African partners to counter top adversaries like China and Russia from expanding ties on the continent.\n\nThe Biden administration has been working to revitalize relations with nations across Africa as one of its top geopolitical objectives and Blinken will not be the only diplomat hitting the continent this week.\n\nUnder Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights Uzra Zeya will travel to The Gambia and Senegal, while Lee Satterfield, Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs, will hit South Africa this week.\n\nSOUTH AFRICA DRILLS WITH RUSSIA, CHINA COULD SIGNIFY FAILED WASHINGTON EFFORTS TO SOLIDIFY AFRICAN ALLIES\n\n\"You'll be seeing this as the year of travel of U.S. officials to Africa,\" Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Molly Phee told reporters last week. \"We've already seen the First Lady and the Treasury Secretary as well as Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield on the continent, and I expect to see many more leaders of the administration visiting to deepen and expand our partnerships.\"\n\nThe trips come as news continues to immerge on both China's and Russia's growing ties with nations in Africa as they face increasing opposition from the West.\n\nA report released earlier this month showed that not only are China and Russia expending more when it comes to trade, infrastructure development, and natural resources across the continent, but in arms sales as well.\n\nTogether Russia and China make up nearly half of all arms sales to Sub Sahara Africa with a combined total of 46 percent of the region's arms deals over the last decade.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2021, Russia contributed 24 percent to arms exports to Sub Sahara Africa, while China provided 22 percent of the region's arms - far outstripping the U.S.'s five percent, according to data released by the Atlantic Council earlier this month.\n\nWhile's Russia has long held a reputation as a top arms dealer to the continent, largely providing light arms and ammunitions, China has more recently ramped up its involvement in the arms sector.\n\nThroughout the entirety of the 90s, China provided roughly $220 million in arms to Sub Sahara Africa, but by the early 2000s that number began to ramp up and by 2010 they provided $205 million worth of arms to the region in that year alone.\n\nIn 2013 alone China exported $423 million worth of arms to the region - a time frame that coincided with the launch of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nOver a 10-year period beginning 2010, China would contribute more than $2 billion in arms sales to Sub Sahara Africa by 2021.\n\n\"It's a lucrative business to be in. There are 54 countries which all have individual armies and they have a variety of security needs,\" Cameron Hudson, a senior associate in the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) told Fox News Digital. \"It's a large market, it's a growing market.\"\n\nRUSSIAN WAGNER GROUP GAINS GLOBAL NOTORIETY FROM AFRICA TO UKRAINE, BUT DIVISION BREWS AT HOME\n\nHudson explained that more limited arms sales to countries across Africa from the U.S. and its allied nations boils down to defensive standards and democratic values the West adheres to.\n\n\"What separates these two countries from for example the U.S. or European countries is that they will actively sell into armed conflict. They will actively sell to governments that have spotty human rights records,\" he said. \"Our arms sales to African countries are in the context of a much broader security assistance program.\"\n\nHudson explained that the U.S. tends to look at security assistance to Sub Sahara Africa in the lens of a broader security package, that often include elements outside of arms sales.\n\n\"Russia and China tend to conduct arms sales as a profit-making exercise,\" he added.\n\nHudson explained that Russia's and China's lax attitude when it comes to who they sell arms to is concerning in the fact that it could \"extend ongoing conflicts or create new tensions\" - a geopolitical quagmire Russia has already been accused of propagating.\n\nRussia's mercenary Wagner Group has dispersed some 10,000 soldiers for hire throughout Africa where they have been accused of destabilizing governments, local elections and causing general turmoil in pursuit of Russian interests in resource-rich nations.\n\nThe notorious group, which the Kremlin still alleges no official connections despite known arms support from its defense ministry, have also been accused of human rights abuses and war crimes in places like Mali - an issue Blinken will likely address during his trip to Niger.\n\n\"Niger is a country that is surrounded by states that have been overthrown by military coup d'etats,\" Hudson explained, referring to Mali, Chad and Libya- all of which now have seen the Wagner group insert itself within their borders over the last year or so.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThough Niger remains a democracy and a partner nation to the U.S., Hudson explained it is a \"very weak democracy\" vulnerable to Russian aggression.\n\n\"Here is a country that is at risk of seeing its democratic light extinguished and is at risk on all sides by Russian incursion,\" he continued. \"Blinken is going there to really help lift them up, shine a light on the democratic process and to kind of keep Russia at bay.\n\n\"I'll be interested to see how aggressively Blinken does that when he's there,\" Hudson added.",

                    "body": "\"The impacts of the global arms trade aren't just about the volume of weapons delivered,\" said one expert, citing \"a few examples of how U.S. arms deliveries can make the world a more dangerous place.\"\n\nA Sweden-based research institute published a report Monday showing that the United States accounted for 40% of the world's weapons exports in the years 2018-22, selling armaments to more than 100 countries while increasing its dominance of the global arms trade.\n\nThe report -- entitled Trends in International Arms Transfers, 2022 -- was published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and listed the United States, Russia, France, China, and Germany as the world's top five arms exporters from 2018-22. The five nations accounted for 76% of worldwide weapons exports during that period.\n\nThe five biggest arms importers over those five years were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia, and China.\n\nThe United States saw a 14% increase in arms exports over the previous five-year period analyzed by SIPRI. U.S. arms were delivered to 103 nations from 2018-22, with 41% going to the Middle East.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher at the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program, said in a statement. \"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: Arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Russia's invasion of Ukraine early last year \"had only a limited impact on the total volume of arms transfers in 2018-22, but Ukraine did become a major importer of arms in 2022.\"\n\nUkraine was the 14th-largest arms importer from 2018-22 and the third-biggest last year.\n\nWiliam Hartung, a senior research fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, wrote Monday that \"the impacts of the global arms trade aren't just about the volume of weapons delivered. The question is how those weapons are likely to be used, and the extent to which they promote stability versus fueling conflict or propping up repressive regimes with abysmal human rights records.\"\n\n\"On this score the United States has much room for improvement,\" he continued. \"Transfers to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for use at the peak of their brutal war in Yemen, and sales to major human rights violators from the Philippines, Egypt, and Nigeria are a few examples of how U.S. arms deliveries can make the world a more dangerous place.\"\n\n\"There are a number of promising steps that Congress can take -- as articulated by a new coalition, the Arms Sales Accountability Project -- that would mandate closer scrutiny of U.S. sales,\" Hartung asserted.\n\n\"There is also some useful language in the Biden administration's new arms transfer policy directive, that, if implemented, would significantly rein in the most egregious sales,\" he added. \"Only time will tell if U.S. policy can be moved towards one based on arms sales restraint rather than arms sales promotion.\"",

In the Middle East, the largest arms supplier is also the US, providing 54 per cent of the region's arms imports.\n\nAs a result of military aid from the US and many European states following the Ukraine crisis in February 2022, Ukraine became the third biggest importer of major arms during 2022.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme, in a press statement.\n\nHeadquartered in Stockholm, SIPRI's research covers international conflicts, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

                    "body": "With a 93 percent jump compared to the year before, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nUkraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 percent of arms transfers to Europe and eight percent of world deliveries overall, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to put a dollar-value as many contracts are opaque, the global arms trade totals above $100 billion a year, and SIPRI said last year that total military expenditures had exceeded $2 trillion for the first time.\n\nEstimated military expenditures for 2022 by SIPRI will be released in April.\n\nThe surge in imports to Ukraine accelerated an already rising trend, as European states had already begun re-arming in the light of rising tension with Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nEuropean states have either \"already ordered or are planning to\" weapons ranging from \"submarines to combat aircraft, from drones to anti-tank missiles, from rifles to radars\", Wezeman said.\n\n\"Everything is being looked at, because the idea is to strengthen military capacity through the whole spectrum of available military technology.\"\n\nSIPRI prefers analysing trends over half-decades as a few contracts can tilt yearly figures.\n\nOver the last five years (2018-2022), European imports have increased by 47 percent compared to the previous five years, while world transfers have declined by five percent, it said.\n\nUnlike Europe, all other continents have seen a decline in imports over the last five years.\n\nThere was a marked drop in Africa (-40 percent) and in North and South America (-20 percent), and declines as well in Asia (-7 percent) and the Middle East (-9 percent).\n\nIn another major shift, the Middle East became the leading destination for arms exports over the past year, accounting for 32 percent of the world total.\n\nIt jumped ahead of Asia-Oceania, which was in first place for years but fell to second in 2022, with 30 percent of the total and with Europe closing in with 27 percent.\n\nChina is continuing to spend heavily on its military but is increasingly producing its weapons locally, which leads to reduced exports to Asia, SIPRI said.\n\nThe main destinations for arms transfers were Qatar (10 percent of the world total), India (9 percent) and Ukraine (8 percent), followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (7 percent each) and Pakistan (5 percent).\n\nThe world's top five exporters over the past five years remained the United States (40 percent); Russia (16 percent); France (11 percent); China (5 percent); and Germany (4 percent).\n\nTogether they account for three quarters of all world exports.",

                    "body": "Three of the top ten countries that imported weapons in the Middle East from 2018-2022 included Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt, CNN Arabic reported.\n\nThe top five countries for arms importers included India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China, which accounted for 36 percent of the total global arms imports.\n\nThe \"Trends in International Arms Transfers 2022\" report, published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, stated that arms imports by countries in the Middle East decreased by 8.8 percent between 2018 and 2022 compared to between 2013-2017.\n\nThe report included 167 countries classified as major arms importers between 2018 and 2022.\n\nThe US seized 54 percent of arms imports from the Middle East, followed by France at 12 percent Russia at 8.6 percent and Italy at 8.4 percent.\n\nEgypt's economy has struggled since the 2011 ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak. The country's net foreign reserves stood at $17.52 billion at the end of May, less than half the $36 billion it had before the 2011 uprising.\n\nEgypt was world's fourth-biggest weapons importer in 2016, spending almost US$2.3 billion, in 2015 the consulting company IHS Inc. said in its Global Defence Trade Report.\n\nBefore 2013, the country spent $1 billion or less annually, but \"there's been this ramp-up,\" according to Ben Moores, a senior defense analyst at IHS Aerospace, Defence & Security, who wrote the report.\n\nIHS research indicates the higher spending is being underwritten by Egyptian allies France and Gulf Arab states, Moores added in the report published in 2016.\n\nUnder President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt has purchased weapons from both France and the United States, despite a temporary block on arms exports from the US. The French imports include Rafale fighter jets and the FREMM-class frigate.\n\nContributions from the United States include F-16 fighter jets and M1A1 Abrams tanks, a staple of the Egyptian miltary for several years. Egypt has also made weapons deals with Russia and Germany, part of an overall policy of diversifying the sources of military and security support.",

France ranks third in the list of global arms exporters - behind the US and Russia, but ahead of China and Germany.\n\nDelhi's orders to France included around 62 combat aircraft and four submarines, Sipri said.\n\nThe fall in Russia's share coincides with calls for Delhi to take tougher a stand on the Ukraine war.\n\nMoscow has been a time tested ally of India and the two countries have shared a close defence relationship for decades - the Indian Army is equipped with Russian-made tanks and rifles, while its air force uses Sukhoi fighter jets and Mi-17 helicopters.\n\nDelhi has not explicitly condemned the Ukraine war but has talked about the importance of \"the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states\".\n\nThe atmosphere was tense at a recent G20 meeting when top diplomats from opposing sides met in Delhi.",

                    "body": "India has emerged as the world's largest importer of arms for the five-year period 2018-22; (Representative image: ANI)\n\nNotwithstanding the measures taken by the Narendra Modi government to reduce military dependence on foreign platforms, India has again emerged as the world's largest importer of arms, for the five-year period 2018-22. A silver lining, though, is the 11 per cent drop in arms imports from the previous five-year span of 2013-17.\n\nAccording to the latest report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the drop in imports can be attributed to several factors, including India's slow and complex arms procurement process, the efforts to diversify arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms designed and produced domestically.\n\nThe Indian government has taken multiple initiatives in line with its 'Vocal for Local' push for the indigenous defence sector, including earmarking 75 per cent of this year's defence capital procurement budget for buying weapons and systems from local manufacturers, along with issuing, over the past 30 months, four 'positive indigenisation lists', effectively barring the import of 411 military items.\n\n\"India's tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its arms imports,\" SIPRI said in its report. Arms imports by Pakistan increased by 14 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and accounted for 3.7 per cent of the global total. China met over three quarters (77 per cent) of Pakistan's arms import needs in 2018-22.\n\nThe \u00ef\u00ac\u0081ve biggest arms importers in 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China. The \u00ef\u00ac\u0081ve biggest arms exporters during the period were the United States, Russia, France, China and Germany.\n\nWith 11 per cent share in the total global arms imports, India was the biggest importer of major arms in 2018-22, a position it has held from 1993 to 2022. Russia was the largest supplier of arms to India in both 2013-17 and 2018-22, but its share in total Indian arms imports fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent in this period.\n\n\"Russia's position as India's main arms supplier is under pressure due to strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production and, since 2022, the constraints on Russia's arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine,\" the SIPRI report said, while adding that India's arms imports from France, which included 62 combat aircraft and four submarines, had jumped by 489 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. France, thus, displaced the US to become the second largest arms supplier to India in 2018-22.\n\nIt is notable that two-thirds of the Indian military inventory is of Russian origin. However, US weapons and military platforms have gradually gained space in the last one decade. Close to two-thirds of Russian arms exports in 2018-22 went to three countries: India (31 per cent), China (23 per cent) and Egypt (9.3 per cent).\n\nIndia was also the largest recipient of Russian arms in 2013-17, but Russian exports to India decreased by 37 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. In contrast, Russia's exports to China (+39 per cent) and Egypt (+44 per cent) increased within the same time frame, the report said, while noting that Russia made no deliveries to Egypt in 2021-22 and the volume of deliveries to China in 2020-22 was much lower than in 2018-19. \"It is likely that order volumes from these two states will reduce in the coming years,\" the report stated.",

                    "body": "By Dipu Rai: Despite a decline in the last five years, India continues to be the world's top arms importer. However, according to an analysis by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), European countries have been aggressively importing arms in recent years.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of the report:\n\nIndia and Saudi Arabia are among the top arms importers.\n\nThe United States and four other countries account for over three-quarters of all arms exports.\n\nImports of major arms by European nations rose by 47 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, while the global volume of arms transfers fell 5.1 per cent in the same period.\n\nTwenty-nine countries supplied arms to Ukraine in 2022. The US has emerged as a major arms supplier to Ukraine, accounting for 35 per cent of total arms imports.\n\nSIPRI's analysis attributed India's demand for arms imports to its ongoing tensions with Pakistan and China. \"India's tensions with Pakistan and China primarily drive its demand for arms imports. With an 11 per cent share of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-22, a position it held from 1993-2022\", the report has observed.\n\nRussia was India's largest arms supplier, but its market share dropped around 19 percentage points from 2013-17 to 2018-22.\n\nDeclining imports in recent years\n\nThe report says India remained the world's top arms importer between 2018-22, although its arms imports declined by 11% compared to 2013-17. The decline in Indian arms imports was due to the sluggish pace of the procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers, and a shift towards domestically produced arms.\n\nIndia is the largest arms export market for Russia, France, and Israel.\n\nDip in global arms trade even as Europe has gone for aggressive acquisition\n\nThe global volume of international arms transfers fell by 5.1 per cent. In contrast, Ukraine did become a major importer of arms in 2022. Imports of significant arms by European countries rose by 47 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war may have played a big role.\n\nAlso Read | The firearms trap\n\nSince its independence in 1991, Ukraine imported very little till 2021. However, this changed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, as the United States and many European states began to send large quantities of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nOf the 29 countries that supplied arms to Ukraine in 2022, the US remained the leading supplier, accounting for 35 per cent of the total Ukrainian arms imports.\n\nThe report notes that ongoing geopolitical tensions have driven demand for arms imports. Though a big player in global trade, India has begun to produce defence equipment indigenously, and the process has accelerated in the last few years.",

The report comes at a time when India is redoubling its efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in defence manufacturing.\n\nAccording to data published by the think tank that measures weapons imports over five-year periods, India had the highest share of global arms imports in the last five years at 11 per cent, followed by Saudi Arabia (9.6 per cent), Qatar (6.4 per cent), Australia (4.7 per cent) and China (4.7 per cent).\n\nThe latest report confirms the findings of last year's Sipri report. According to 2022, India's imports fell 21 per cent between 2012-16 and 2017-21, but the country remained the world's largest arms importer. According to the new report, the reasons for the decline in India's imports include efforts to replace imports with domestic products and a complex procurement process.\n\nOver the last four to five years, India has taken a slew of steps to increase its defence self-reliance. These include establishing a separate budget for purchasing locally manufactured military hardware, increasing foreign direct investment from 49 per cent to 74 per cent and notifying hundreds of weapons and systems that cannot be imported and will be indigenous over the next five to six years.\n\nIn this year's defence budget, approximately 1 lakh crore was set aside for domestic procurement, compared to 84,598 crore, 70,221 crore and 51,000 crore in the previous three years.\n\n\"The Indian military is large and will continue to import weapons and systems for some more years. The reduction in India's arms imports is an important achievement. \"As indigenisation efforts succeed, imports will fall even further,\" said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general of the Centre for Air Power Studies.\n\nThe ranking system is dynamic because it is determined by how orders are placed in a given year. For example, according to the 2019 SIPRI report, India is no longer the world's largest importer of weapons, a position it has held for decades, with Saudi Arabia leading the global share of arms imports between 2014 and 2018. Saudi Arabia accounted for 12 per cent of global arms imports during that time period, with India coming in second with a 9.5 per cent share.\n\nAccording to new SIPRI data, the United States has been the world's leading military exporter over the last five years, accounting for 40 per cent of global exports, followed by Russia (16 per cent), France (11 per cent), China (5.2 per cent), and Germany (4.2 per cent). Between 2013-17 and 2018-22, US arms exports increased by 14 per cent, while Russian exports decreased by 31 per cent. Russia's imports into India dropped by 37 per cent.\n\n\"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports. This is because Russia will prioritise supplying its armed forces, while demand from other countries will remain low due to trade sanctions against Russia and increasing pressure from the United States and its allies not to buy Russian arms,\" said Siemon T Wezeman, a senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nOn 3 March, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan stated that one of the most important lessons for India from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict is self-reliance in defence manufacturing and that the three services will have to be the driving force for the campaign to succeed.\n\n\"We cannot be reliant on foreign military supplies. In the last two to three years, we have taken some baby steps towards self-sufficiency. The government has launched a slew of initiatives to boost it. I believe that the three services will have to be the driving force for this campaign to succeed,\" Chauhan said at the Raisina Dialogue.\n\nAccording to Sipri, Ukraine was the third-largest importer of major arms in 2022 and the 14th-largest in 2018-22.\n\nFrance's arms exports increased 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, with India receiving 30 per cent of its exports over the last five years, according to the report, adding that France had surpassed the United States as India's second-largest supplier of arms after Russia.\n\n\"As Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, France is gaining a larger share of the global arms market,\" Wezeman said.",

                    "body": "New Delhi: India has remained the world's top importer of arms for the past five years despite having two adversarial neighbours in China and Pakistan. According to new data published by the Swedish-based Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, India was the greatest arms importer between 2018 and 2022, accounting for 11% of all imports (SIPRI). Moreover, Russia, France and Israel were the main exporters of weapons and allied equipment to India, the annual report of the prestigious Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said on Monday. The second biggest importer is Saudi Arabia.\n\nIndia is still the world's largest importer of military equipment, despite an 11% decline in arms purchases between 2013-17 and 2018-22. The SIPRI report is released at a time when India has intensified its efforts to become self-reliant in the defence manufacturing sector. According to data from the think tank that tracks weapons imports over five-year periods, India's percentage of the world's imports was the greatest in the past five years at 11%, followed by Saudi Arabia (9.6%), Qatar (6.4%), Australia (4.7%), and China (4.7%).\n\nAround \u20b91 lakh crore was set aside for domestic procurement in this year's defence budget, compared to \u20b984,598 crore, \u20b970,221 crore and \u20b951,000 crore in the three previous years.\n\nThroughout the time periods 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, Russia was India's top supplier of weapons, although its proportion of the country's overall weapon imports dropped from 64% to 45%. \"Russia's position as India's principal arms supplier is under pressure due to strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production, and, since 2022, the restrictions on Russia's arms shipments associated to its invasion of Ukraine,\" SIPRI stated.\n\nIndia has been the world's top importer of arms since 1993, according to SIPRI data. This highlights both India's ongoing inability to develop a robust defense-industrial base with significantly more private sector involvement and the subpar performance of the DRDO, defence PSUs, and ordnance factories over the years.\n\nThe top 10 arms exporters, in turn, are the US (40%), Russia (16%), France (11%), China (5.2%), Germany (4.2%), Italy (3.8%), UK (3.2%), Spain (2.6%), South Korea (2.4%) and Israel (2.3%). China, incidentally, accounts for 77% of the arms supplies to Pakistan. India is followed by Saudi Arabia (9.6%), Qatar (6.4%), Australia (4.7%), China (4.6%), Egypt (4.5%), South Korea (3.7%) and Pakistan (3.7%) among the top 10 arms importers.\n\n\"The decrease can be attributed to several factors including India's slow and complex arms procurement process, efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms that are designed and produced domestically,\" the report noted.",

                    "body": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to a substantial flow of military aid to Kyiv from the U.S. and Europe that helped make Ukraine the world's third-largest importer of arms in 2022, according to a new report.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, reported Monday that, from 1991, when Ukraine became independent amid the fall of the Soviet Union, until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms.\n\nBut Moscow's invasion, which began Feb. 24 , 2022, markedly changed that. Only Qatar -- which has dramatically ramped up its arms-purchasing in the last decade -- and India imported more arms last year, SIPRI said in its report on global arms transfers.\n\nPieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program noted that, even as arms transfers declined globally last year, \"those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states.\" He said that following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms \"faster.\"\n\nSIPRI said that the export of arms has long been dominated by the U.S. and Russia, with the two countries being the largest and second-largest arms exporters for the last three decades.\n\nHowever, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the thir- largest arms supplier, France, has narrowed. The think tank said it was likely that the invasion of Ukraine would further limit Russia's arms exports because of Moscow's need to prioritize supplying its own armed forces and low demand from other states amid trade sanctions.\n\nSIPRI's data showed that U.S. arms exports increased by 14% between the periods 2013-17 and 2018-22, and Washington accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018-22.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's arms exports fell by 31% between the two periods, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22% to 16%, whereas France's share increased from 7.1% to 11%.\n\nSIPRI, established in 1966, is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

                    "body": "Ukraine has become the world's third largest weaponry importer in 2022 as a result of the massive amount of heavy military aid offered by the United States and European countries following the full-scale Russian invasion in February last year.\n\nAccording to a recent analysis by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), from 1991 to the end of 2021, Ukraine bought a tiny number of large weapons, despite accounting for 2% of global arms imports over the last five years, the SIPRI reported on March 13.\n\nAccording to the institute's data, European weaponry imports rose by 47% between 2013 and 2022 \"due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states.\"\n\nThe SIPRI added that the United States' share of arms exports had increased from 33 to 40%, while Russia's dropped from 22 to 16%.\n\n'Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nUkraine has been asking for fighter jets for months in order to defend its airspace and increase the efficiency of its combined arms forces during a future invasion. But, other Western allies, like the United States and Germany, have ruled out sending jets at this time.\n\nOn March 8, EU defense ministers agreed in Stockholm to increase ammunition supplies to Ukraine but have yet to achieve a \"concrete and legal agreement.\"",

                    "body": "A report released by Sweden-based think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday morning said that India has yet again emerged as the largest importer of arms, accounting for nearly 11% of all international imports of various pieces of military equipment, says Girish Linganna\n\nAlmost exactly a month ago, on Sunday, February 12, 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about how India's ambitions of becoming a major defence hub could become a reality. PM Modi announced a hugely ambitious target of $5 billion worth of annual exports by the year 2024-2025.\n\nAgainst the backdrop, manufacturing firms worldwide flocked to the biennial five-day mega-Aero India, 2023, in Bengaluru, for a slice of the country's massive import budget pie. A total of 266 partnerships -- 201 MoUs, 53 major communiqu\u00e9s and 9 product launches were firmed up at the Aero India event. These held the potential of unlocking business deals worth about Rs 80,000 crore.\n\nExactly 15 Sundays earlier, on October 30, 2022, PM Modi, while laying the foundation stone in Vadodara, Gujarat, for the production of the European C-295 military transport aircraft, had called on global defence majors to build military hardware and platforms for the world with India as their hub.\n\nPM Modi said India was marching forward with the mantra of Make in India and Make for the Globe and that his government's \"stable, predictable and futuristic\" policies were propelling the country to a higher trajectory of economic self-sufficiency.\n\nIn the early-2000s, the government had permitted 100 per cent private sector participation in defence production with a cap of up to 26 per cent in foreign direct investment (FDI). But the incentive did not succeed in promoting defence contracts as the Ministry of Defence's (MoD's) Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) lacked enough attractions to encourage private enterprises to take part in the process.\n\nThe list of major defence items that India exports are personal protective items, ALH helicopters, offshore patrol vessels, coastal surveillance systems, Bharati radio, SU avionics, Kavach MoD II launcher and FCS, besides light engineering mechanical parts and spares for radar and electronic systems.\n\nBut sadly, the resolve to build India into one of the leading defence exporters comes at a time when it continues to be one of the world's biggest arms importers. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report, despite a substantial decline in Indian arms imports in the global basket, India was the world's largest importer of major arms in the period under review.\n\nThe SIPRI report said that, while Russia continued to be the largest supplier of arms to India and accounted for 45 per cent of all Indian imports, India imported 29 per cent of equipment from France and 11 per cent from the US. Other countries from where India imported weapons during this period included South Korea, Israel and South Africa.\n\nJuxtaposing two five-year periods of Russia's exports to India, the report stated that Russia was the largest arms supplier to India between 2013 and 2017, although India's imports fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent between 2018 and 2022.\n\nAs the Russia-Ukraine war erupted, the United States and many European nations sent in military aid to Ukraine. Behind India and Qatar, it was the third-largest country to import arms in 2022 after India and Qatar. In the five years under review (2018-2022), Ukraine holds the 14th position, accounting for two per cent of the world's arms imports.\n\nRUSSIAN EXPORTS TO INDIA\n\nRussia continues to be the main weapons supplier to India, according to the SIPRI report, but now faces considerable competition from other countries which, too, are turning to India to dump their arms even as their constraints on Russia's weapons exports have arisen following the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nTHE TRIANGULAR EQUATION\n\nThe increasing acrimony along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and across the Line of Control (LoC) has provided an impetus to India's arms requirements. Pakistan's weapons imports have risen by nearly 14 per cent between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, accounting for 3.7 per cent of the world's total arms imports. In the last five-year period under review (2018-2022), China supplied more than three-fourths (77%) of Pakistan's arms imports.\n\nEAST ASIA WEAPONS IMPORTS\n\nEast Asia's weapons imports rose by 21 per cent during the five years under review compared to those in the previous five years. While China's weapons imports rose by 4.1 per cent, surprisingly, Russia is the primary source -- the most significant increase in arms imports was evidenced among the NATO allies, South Korea (61 per cent) and Japan (171 per cent). Australia, the most prominent arms importer in Oceania, saw a 23 per cent jump in its weapons imports.\n\nTHE FRENCH CONNECTION\n\nFrance's arms sales jumped by a huge margin of 44 per cent during 2013-2017 to 2018-2022. A major portion of its exports was made to countries in the Middle East and Asia-Oceania regions. In 2018-2022, India was the largest importer of French weaponry, accounting for 30% of the total share. France beat the US to become India's second-largest arms supplier after Russia.\n\nROOSTER BEATS DOUBLE EAGLE\n\n'France is increasing its share in the global arms market due to a decrease in Russian arms exports. India is an example. This trend will continue because France currently has more pending orders for arms exports than Russia, which is expected to continue until the end of end-2022,' said Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher, Arms Transfers Programme, SIPRI.\n\nIndia reached a new milestone in 2021-2022, with the country's defence exports pegged at $1,572.6 million. The value of defence exports rose by $536.5 million -- a 51 per cent rise between 2020 and 2021, and this is despite the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 when India's defence exports fell by only 7.5 per cent compared to 2019.\n\nIn keeping with the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat, in 2020-2021, 74 per cent of the contracts awarded by the Army were to Indian vendors, which is praiseworthy. The Centre has set an ambitious target for defence production to reach $22 billion by 2025, up from the current $12 billion.\n\nThe Defence Ministry, however, exudes confidence that \"we are well on course to achieving the defence exports target of Rs 25,000 crore by 2025.\" The latest SIPRI report notwithstanding, if that is achieved, it would be setting a remarkable milestone on the journey of Atmanirbhar Bharat.",

India accounts for 11% of the total global imports in 2018-2022 despite the government's continuing thrust on \"Make in India\" in defence production. This is according to the latest data on international arms transfers released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Report shows Russia remains the largest weapons supplier to India with 45% of the total imports in the 2018-2022 timeframe, though its share is declining. France accounts for 29%, displacing the US from the second position by riding on deals like the Rs 59,000 crore one for 36 Rafale fighters. US, in turn, notched up 11% of the total weapon sales to India. India is followed by Saudi Arabia (9.6%), Qatar (6.4%), Australia (4.7%), China (4.6%), Egypt (4.5%), South Korea (3.7%) and Pakistan (3.7%) among the top 10 arms importers. As per SIPRI data, India has been the world's largest arms importer since 1993.This underlines India's persisting failure to build a strong defence-industrial base.",

                    "body": "Russia is still India's primary source of weapons even as the country has drastically trimmed purchases, according to report by news agency Bloomberg. This development highlights the challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of recalibrating New Delhi's dependence on Moscow, while its borders with both China and Pakistan remain tense, the report said.\n\nArms and ammunitions imports from Russia declined by 19 per cent for the five year period starting 2018 compared to a present time frame, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent think tank which studies conflict, weapon sales and disarmament.\n\nAccording to the latest report released on Monday, \"Russia was the largest supplier of arms to India in both 2013-17 and 2018-22, but its share of total Indian arms imports fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent.\"\n\nIndia's dependence on Moscow for weapons is one of the factors behind New Delhi's neutral stance on Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, despite pressure from countries such as the US, Japan, and Australia, the news agency pointed out.\n\nIndia has supported calls for a ceasefire and a diplomatic solution to end Russia's war, but has abstained at the United Nations on votes condemning Russia's invasion. It has also continued its purchases of cheap Russian crude oil.\n\nIndia has been the world's largest arms importer since 1993 and \"tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports,\" the report added.\n\nSanctions on Russia, affecting weapons exports, increased defence equipment manufacturing in India, and increased competition from countries like France -- that has seen its arms exports to New Delhi jump a whopping 489 per cent over the same period -- leading to the drop in purchases from Moscow, the SIPRI report added.\n\nParis has edged out the US to become the second-largest weapons supplier to India in 2018-22.\n\nIn the last Union Budget, the defence sector allocation was increased to Rs 5.94 lakh crore for 2023-24 from last year's Rs 5.25 lakh crore. A total of Rs 1.62 lakh crore has been set aside for capital expenditure. It includes purchasing new weapons, aircraft, warships, and other military hardware.\n\nFor 2022-23, the budgetary allocation for capital outlay was Rs 1.52 lakh crore but the revised estimate showed the expenditure at Rs 1.50 lakh crore. An allocation of Rs 2,70,120 crore has been made for revenue expenditure that includes expenses on payment of salaries and maintenance of establishments, according to the budget documents.",

                    "body": "HONG KONG /XIANGGANG/, March 14. /TASS/. A major drop in China's arms exports could be a sign that the country is stockpiling weapons domestically amid growing geopolitical tensions and disruptions caused by its anti-Covid-19 restrictions, the South China Morning Post quoted a Chinese expert as saying on Tuesday.\n\n\"The decline in arms exports from China could be a sign that Beijing was focusing more on domestic needs as geopolitical tensions rose,\" Ni Lexiong, a professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, told the newspaper. According to him, the geopolitical situation around mainland China is deteriorating, including the Taiwan issue, the situation on the border with India as well as relations with Japan. \"China has to be ready for confrontations at all times,\" the expert argues.\n\nOn Monday, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published a report on international arms sales for 2018-2022. According to the report, global arms exports have been dominated by the United States and Russia, while China saw a 23% decline in arms exports, ranking fourth behind Germany.\n\nMeanwhile, arms imports by China increased by 4.1% between 2018-2022, with 83% of those imports coming from Russia. France and Ukraine became the second and third largest arms importers, respectively.\n\nChina plans a 7.2% hike in its defense budget to 1.553 trillion yuan (around $224.85 billion) for 2023, according to an announcement made at the opening meeting of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on March 5. SIPRI and many other international organizations suspect that China is underreporting its military budget by as much as 25% to 50%.",

On the other hand, the country in conflict has become the third world destination for weapons, according to the report of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\nEurope is the only region in the world where purchases are increasing. With an increase of 93% in one year, imports have also increased due to the rise in military spending of states such as Poland and Norway, which according to the study will accelerate even more. While global arms trade fell by 5.1% between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, Europe imported 47% in that period, rising to 65% if all member countries of NATO on the continent.\n\n\"The invasion has caused a significant increase in the demand for arms in Europe, which has not yet shown its full potential and will in all likelihood lead to further increases in imports,\" Pieter Wezeman, co-author of the prestigious report, told AFP. which has been published for three decades.\n\nOver the course of a year, Ukraine has gone from being an insignificant arms importer to becoming the third largest buyer, behind Qatar and India, as a direct result of the Russian invasion.\n\nOf the 29 countries that have supplied arms to Ukraine, the United States accounted for 35 percent of the total, followed by Poland (17 percent), the United Kingdom (10 percent) and the Czech Republic (4.4 percent).\n\nOn the other hand, the United States has strengthened its dominance in the global arms trade in the last five years. US arms sales grew by 14% in 2018-2022 compared to 2013-2017 and its share of global exports rose from 33% to 40% in that time, while 'has widened the gap with the second largest exporter, Russia, weighed down by sanctions and focused on production for its own military.\n\nIf in 2013-2017 US exports were 50% greater than Russian exports, the following year this distance multiplied to 148%. Russian exports fell by 31% in this period and their global share dropped from 22% to 16%.\n\nSpain is the sixth world exporter, with a share of 2.6% despite a fall in sales, with Australia, Saudi Arabia and Belgium as the main buyers. India remains the main importer, with a share of 11%.",

These countries together imported 36% of the world's arms during the five-year period.\n\nIndia retained its pole position even though its arms imports dropped by 11% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, the SIPRI report showed. New Delhi has been the leading importer of arms and ammunition since 1993.\n\nAccording to SIPRI, India's demand for arms is largely driven by its cross-border tensions with Pakistan and China.\n\nHowever, it said the decline in arms imports over the last decade could be attributed to several factors including India's slow and complex arms procurement process, efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms that are designed and produced domestically.\n\nData released on Monday showed that Russia remained India's largest arms supplier between the two five-year periods of 2013-17 and 2018-22, even though the share of arms imports from Moscow fell from 64% to 45%.\n\nFrance emerged as the second-largest arms supplier to India between 2018-22 at 29%, followed by the US at 11%.\n\n\"Russia's position as India's main arms supplier is under pressure due to strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production and, since 2022, the above-mentioned constraints on Russia's arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine,\" the SIPRI said.\n\nBesides Russia and France, India also imported arms from Israel, South Korea, and South Africa during this five-year period.",

                    "body": "Washington-based think tank finds Chinese military exports to sub-Saharan African countries dwarfed those from US over past decade\n\nResearchers noted that the top five buyers were the same ones who have benefited the most from China\u2019s infrastructure spending\n\nChina transferred or sold more arms to countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) than its rival the US over the past decade, as Beijing cemented its economic and security cooperation with the continent, a new study shows.\n\nThe Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank report said that between 2010 and 2021, China accounted for 22 per cent of the US$9.32 billion in total arms exports to the SSA countries south of the Sahara.\n\nAt US$2.04 billion, Chinese sales were second only to Russia, and almost three times the amount exported to the region by the US, according to the study based on data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nRussian arms exports made up 24 per cent of the total, at US$2.24 billion, while US sales over the decade came to just 5 per cent, with US$473 million, said the report by macroeconomist Amin Mohseni-Cheraghlou and consultant Naomi Aladekoba, both from the Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Centre.\n\nThe researchers also found that between 2017 and 2020, China exported almost three times as many arms to SSA than the United States.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting to note that China\u2019s arms exports to SSA reached an all-time high of US$423 million in 2013, which coincides with the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative,\u201d the report said.China\u2019s belt and road funding in sub-Saharan Africa falls to historical low\n\nMohseni-Cheraghlou and Aladekoba said that more than 60 per cent of Chinese arms exports to the region went to five countries, with Tanzania taking the most at 19.6 per cent. Nigeria was second, with 13.5 per cent, and Sudan third, on 12.6 per cent.\n\nCameroon took 11.2 per cent of the total and Zambia accounted for 6.22 per cent of arms purchases from China, they found.\n\n\u201cThese countries also are home to some of China\u2019s largest investment and construction projects in SSA, pointing to a growing linkage between Beijing\u2019s economic interests and security concerns in the region,\u201d their report said.\n\nTo illustrate the overlap between China\u2019s security and economic interests in Africa, the study focused on Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous nation with vast amounts of energy resources and several seaports on the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe report said that between 2006 and 2020, Nigeria attracted more than 13 per cent of all Chinese investment and construction in sub-Saharan Africa, making it the largest recipient of Chinese capital and projects in the region.\n\nIn 2021 alone, China accounted for 34.4 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s arms imports, compared to the US and Russia at 2.67 per cent and 6.49 per cent, respectively. In the same year, Nigerian military spending reached US$4.5 billion, a 56 per cent increase on 2020, the study said.\n\nWhile China has long been known to export mostly light arms to Africa, the report said Beijing had started selling more advanced weaponry to Nigeria, highlighting the country\u2019s centrality to China\u2019s geopolitical calculations in the region.\n\nMohseni-Cheraghlou and Aladekoba said Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine could have opened up new opportunities for Chinese military influence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cInternational sanctions in the wake of that invasion may limit the benefits of Nigeria\u2019s 2021 agreement with Moscow for military equipment and training \u2013 and could mean an increase in Nigeria\u2019s arms imports from China,\u201d their report said.Who will gain most from China-Russia-South Africa military drills?\n\nThe researchers said US sanctions on many Russian defence contractors are forcing Nigeria to consider alternatives.\n\n\u201cChina is clearly the default option as the growing relationship between China and Nigeria in the past few years has also made China the top arms exporter to Nigeria, surpassing Russia in arms exports for two consecutive years,\u201d they said.\n\nThe report covered sub-Saharan Africa, excluding the far larger North African market, made up of countries like Egypt, Morocco and Algeria that import many more weapons than most SSA countries.How Ukraine war has turned Africa into a geopolitical battleground\n\nDavid Shinn, an expert on China-Africa relations at George Washington University\u2019s Elliott School of International Affairs, said the US has never been a significant source of arms for sub-Saharan Africa. Instead, it is an important supplier to Egypt and Morocco.\n\nRussian arms go principally to Algeria and Egypt, while US sales are primarily to Egypt and Morocco, Shinn said. \u201cChina is an important source for Algeria, but well behind Russia and the US for all of North Africa.\u201d\n\nShinn said Chinese arms exports to Africa are driven by their low cost, improving but sometimes still questionable quality, ease of operation, and relatively low maintenance.\n\n\u201cThe key factor in SSA is low cost compared to other sources, including Russia, the primary exporter to all of Africa,\u201d he said.Will Russia\u2019s focus on Ukraine war open an arms export door for China in Africa?\n\nFrancois Vre\u00ff, a research coordinator at the Security Institute for Governance and Leadership in Africa at the Faculty of Military Science, Stellenbosch University, said there had been a visible decline in arms imports to the continent in the past few years.\n\nChina had also diversified its African portfolio through the China-Africa partnership, making arms just one of its export domains, he said. \u201cI know that primary weapons systems are not the norm, therefore many arms transfers are in smaller systems.\u201d\n\nObservers have said China\u2019s growing ambition for a global role is behind is entry into the security domain \u2013 from military to intelligence and policing on land and at sea.\n\n\u201cThe more [China] builds military outposts on the African coast, the more one will see Chinese independence and arms transfers becoming more calibrated to maintain security, not fight wars,\u201d Vre\u00ff said.\n\nHe said it was also of interest that China is edging towards the Atlantic and Africa\u2019s West Coast. \u201cIf arms transfers are the attraction for partner countries then one can expect them to be used to cultivate cooperation and concessions in a region showing little Chinese military inroads.\u201d\n\nVre\u00ff said it was also important to remember that China and Russia do not factor in possible domestic use as a constraint on arms sales, unlike many other countries.",

Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,\" he added.\n\nThe report said three of the top 10 importers during 2018-22 were in the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer during 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period, it said.\n\nQatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third-biggest arms importer during 2018-22, it added.",

France therefore displaced the USA to become the second largest supplier to India in 2018 -- 22,\" the report said.\n\nThe report also found that Ukraine became the third largest importer of major arms in 2022, following its invasion by Russia.\n\n\"As a result of military aid from the US and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022 ... Ukraine accounted for 2.0 per cent of global arms imports in the five-year period,\" it said.\n\nRussia's arms exports have suffered after Ukraine invasion as the US and Europe toughened sanctions on its arms manufacturers, while the conflict has consumed vast amounts of military hardware, delaying some planned exports.\n\nThe report said global arms exports topped $2.1 trillion in 2022, an all time record high.",

                    "body": "France displaced the U.S. as India's second biggest arms supplier.\n\nWhile India's arms imports from Russia, the country's long-standing leading supplier of arms, has fallen sharply by 37%, France has displaced the U.S. as India's second biggest supplier, according to new data on global arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nIndia remains the world's top arms importer, but its arms imports declined by 11% between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and this decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs. India received 30% of France's arms exports in 2018-22, and France displaced the U.S. as the second largest supplier of arms to India after Russia. France's arms exports increased by 44% between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and most of these exports were to Asia and Oceania and the Middle East.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. \"This seems likely to continue, as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia.\"\n\nWhile Russian arms exports to India fell sharply, exports to India's neighbour China increased by 39% and to Egypt by 44%, and they became Russia's second and third largest recipients. Imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth largest arms importer in 2018-22, increased by 14%, with China as its main supplier.\n\nU.S. arms exports increased by 14% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, and the U.S. accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018-22. Russia's arms exports fell by 31% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22% to 16%, while France's share increased from 7.1% to 11%. Global arms exports have long been dominated by the U.S. and Russia (consistently the largest and second largest arms exporters for the past three decades).\n\nHowever, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest supplier, France, has narrowed. \"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports. This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the USA and its allies not to buy Russian arms,\" observes Siemon T. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nThe report says as a result of military aid from the U.S. and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) and the 14th biggest for 2018-22. Ukraine accounted for 2% of global arms imports in the five-year period.\n\nThree of the top 10 importers in 2018-22 were in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt. Saudi Arabia was the world's second largest arms importer in 2018-22 and received 9.6% of all arms imports in the period. Qatar's arms imports increased by 311% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third biggest arms importer in 2018-22. The great majority of arms imports to the Middle East came from the U.S. (54%), followed by France (12%), Russia (8.6%) and Italy (8.4%).",

                    "body": "MP minister plans plantation drive for Shivraj Singh Chouhan's birth anniversary\n\nIndia continues to be the world's top importer of major weapons and military equipment, accounting for 11 per cent of the global arms imports between 2018 and 2022, says a report released on Monday by the Swedish think tank, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\nWhile this suggests the Narendra Modi government's \"Make in India\" motto for the defence sector has a long way to catch up, the report says Indian arms imports fell 11 per cent between the periods 2013- 17 and 2018-22, partly because of domestic production.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer for the 2018-22 period followed by Qatar, Australia and China.\n\nUkraine became the third-largest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) as a result of military aid from the US and many European nations following the Russian invasion in February 2022, the report says.\n\nKyiv, which had imported few major arms since Ukrainian independence in 1991 till the end of 2021, was the 14th biggest overall importer during 2018-22, it adds.\n\nPrime Minister Modi had last month said that India had \"rejuvenated\" its defence production sector in the last eight to nine years and was looking at increasing its export of military hardware from $1.5 billion to $5 billion by 2024-25.\n\n\"India's tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports,\" the Sipri report says.\n\n\"With 11 per cent of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-2022, a position it has held for the period 1993-2022. It retained this position even though its arms imports dropped by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22.\"\n\nThe decrease, the report says, can be attributed to factors such as India's slow and complex arms procurement process, efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms that are designed and produced domestically.\n\nImports by Pakistan, the world's eighth-largest arms importer in 2018-22, increased 14 per cent, with China as the main supplier, the report says.\n\nArms imports by China rose 4.1 per cent, most of it coming from Russia. Russia was the biggest supplier of arms to India during 2013-17 and 2018-22 but its share of total Indian arms imports fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent.\n\nFrance emerged as the second-largest supplier in the 2018-22 period, accounting for 29 per cent of India's imports.\n\nDuring 2018-22 India was the biggest arms export market for Russia, France and Israel. According to the report, the US, Russia and France were the world's three biggest arms exporters in 2018-22 with a 40 per cent, 16 per cent and 11 per cent share of the global market, respectively.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan were among the 10 largest arms importers globally in 2018-22.",

(Representational)\n\nRussia remains India's main source of weapons even as the nation has drastically trimmed purchases, highlighting the challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of recalibrating New Delhi's dependence on Moscow, while its borders with both China and Pakistan remain tense.\n\nRussian weapon imports dropped by 19 per cent for the five year period starting 2018 compared to a similar time frame earlier, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent think tank which studies conflict, weapon sales and disarmament.\n\n\"Russia was the largest supplier of arms to India in both 2013-17 and 2018-22, but its share of total Indian arms imports fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent,\" according to the latest report released on Monday.\n\nIndia's dependence on Moscow for weapons is one of the factors behind New Delhi's neutral stance on Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, despite pressure from countries such as the US, Japan and Australia. The South Asian nation has supported calls for a ceasefire and a diplomatic solution to end Russia's war, but has abstained at the United Nations on votes condemning Russia's invasion. It has also continued its purchases of cheap Russian oil.\n\nIndia has been the world's largest arms importer since 1993 and \"tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports,\" the report added.\n\nSanctions on Russia, affecting weapons exports, increased defense equipment manufacturing in India, and increased competition from countries like France - that has seen its arms exports to New Delhi jump a whopping 489% over the same period - leading to the drop in purchases from Moscow, the SIPRI report added.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nParis has edged out the US to become the second-largest weapons supplier to India in 2018-22.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nFeatured Video Of The DayOscars 2023: The Moment Naatu Naatu Won Best Original Song",

                    "body": "NEW DELHI: India's dependence on imported arms and equipment continues as the country tops arms importers. A report released by Sweden-based Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) found that India was on top among the five largest arms importers during 2018-22 and it was followed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.\n\n\"The top five arms importers -- India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China -- received 36 per cent of total global arms imports in the period,\" the report said SIPRI, which is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament, has identified 167 states as importers of major arms in 2018-22.\n\nElaborating on the reason behind the high import the report attributes India's tensions with Pakistan and China as the reasons largely driving its demand for arms imports. \"With 11 per cent share of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-22, a position it has held for the period 1993-2022.\" the report said.\n\n\"It retained this position even though its arms imports dropped by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22,\" the report added.\n\n\"The decrease can be attributed to several factors including India's slow and complex arms procurement process, efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms that are designed and produced domestically,\" the report said. Russia continues to be the largest arms supplier to India followed by France and the US is in the third position.\n\nHowever, the report says that the share of Russian arms supplies to India is decreasing, says the report. \"Russia was the largest supplier of arms to India in both 2013-17 and 2018-22, but its share of total Indian arms imports fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent.\" Russia's position as India's main arms supplier is under pressure due to strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production and since 2022, the above-mentioned constraints on Russia's arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine, the SIPRI report said.",

                    "body": "New Delhi: India was the world's largest arms importer between 2018 and 2022, accounting for 11 per cent of global imports, according to fresh data released by the Sweden-based Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe data, part of SIPRI's Trends in International Arms Transfers 2022 report released Monday, adds that India was the biggest market for Russian arms exports from 2018 to 2022. India received 31 per cent of the total arms exported by Russia during this period.\n\nHowever, Russian arms exports to India dipped by 37 per cent compared to the 2013-17 period.\n\nAt the same time, arms transfers to China accounted for 23 per cent of Russian arms exports between 2018 and 2022 -- a 37 per cent increase from the 2013-17 period.\n\nAs a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv emerged as the third largest importer of arms in 2022, SIPRI found. Prior to the war, Ukraine was the 14th largest arms importer in the world between 2018 and 2022.\n\nData released by SIPRI also sheds light on the \"all-weather friendship\" between Pakistan and China. According to it, China accounted for 77 per cent of Pakistan's arms imports in the 2018-2022 period, reflecting the extent to which Islamabad is dependent on Beijing for its military needs.\n\nSIPRI identified India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China as the top five arms importers in 2018-22, accounting for 36 per cent of global arms imports during this period. India's share globally was 11 per cent followed by Saudi Arabia with 9.6 per cent and Qatar with 6.4 per cent.\n\nData also identified the US, Russia, France, China, and Germany as the five biggest arms exporters. The five countries alone accounted for 76 per cent of global arms transfers between 2018 and 2022. Of this, the US had a lion's share (40 per cent) with countries in the middle east receiving 41 per cent of the arms exported by it in the said period.\n\nAlso Read: Losses to Russian military power, 7% rise in China's defence spending in 2022, finds IISS\n\nIndia, the largest arms importer in the world since 2013, accounted for a whopping 11 per cent of global arms imports between 2018 and 2022, according to SIPRI.\n\nHowever, data also shows that India's arms imports dropped by 11 per cent in 2018-22 when compared to the 2013-17 period.\n\nSignificantly, France displaced the United States of America to become the second-largest supplier of arms to India between 2018 and 2022 -- an increase of 489 per cent compared to 2013-17. India's arms imports from France in the 2018-22 period comprised 62 combat aircraft and four submarines.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nHe added, \"This seems likely to continue, as, by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia.\"\n\n(Edited by Amrtansh Arora)",

[Photo/Twitter account of the U.S. Department of Defense]\n\nThe United States has benefited from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other regional tensions by boosting its arms sales around the world, while Russia's arms exports plunged, according to the latest report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nThe U.S. share of global arms exports jumped from 33 percent during 2013-17 to 40 percent in 2018-22, while Russia's share declined from 22 percent to 16 percent during those periods. The two countries have long been the world's top two arms exporters.\n\nEuropean countries increased their arms imports by 47 percent from 2013-17 to 2018-22, while the overall global level of international arms transfers decreased by 5.1 percent.\n\nImports have also increased due to increased military spending by European states, including Poland and Norway, and the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, the report said.\n\nThe research institute's report, which was released on Monday, said that arms imports fell 40 percent in Africa, 21 percent in the Americas, 8.8 percent in the Middle East and 7.5 percent in Asia and Oceania. But imports in East Asia rose.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the research institute's Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nEuropean countries want to import more arms quickly following the Russia-Ukraine crisis, while strategic competition has also helped arms sales, he said, citing growing arms imports in East Asia and the Middle East.\n\nFrance, the world's third-largest arms exporter, expanded its share from 7.1 percent in 2013-17 to 11 percent in 2018-22.\n\nRussia's arms exports fell in eight of its 10 biggest markets during those periods. Its arms exports to its largest client, India, declined by 37 percent, but its exports to Egypt increased by 44 percent.\n\nSiemon Wezeman, another senior researcher with the institute's Arms Transfers Programme, said Russia's conflict with Ukraine will further limit its arms exports.\n\n\"This is because Russia will prioritize supply of its armed forces, and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the U.S. and its allies not to buy Russian arms,\" he said.\n\nThe report showed that Ukraine, once a very small buyer, became the world's third-largest arms importer in 2022, trailing Qatar and India.\n\nIt revealed that arms imports by East Asian states grew by 21 percent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Japan increased its imports by 171 percent during those periods, while South Korea expanded its arms imports by 61 percent and Australia by 23 percent. China's arms imports rose by 4.1 percent.\n\nIn a Feb 23 article by The Intercept, a nonprofit news organization, Nick Turse, a fellow at The Nation Institute, criticized the U.S. government for its arms exports.\n\n\"America's weapons consistently stoke conflicts around the world,\" he wrote, citing a 2018 study by the Stimson Center, which found that the U.S. had delivered arms to 27 of 34 countries at war in 2016.\n\nA 2022 analysis by the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a US think tank, found that roughly two-thirds of current conflicts, or 34 out of 46, involve one or more parties armed by the US.\n\nTurse said there has been a clear association in recent years between US-made weapons and human rights abuses in some countries, and the spread of arms to terrorist groups like the Islamic State and criminal gangs in Central America.\n\nA nationwide poll last year by the University of Maryland found bipartisan support for more oversight of US arms exports. About 60 percent of Democrats, 61 percent of independents and 56 percent of Republicans said they want US arms sales of more than $14 million to be approved by a congressional majority.",

(PHOTO / XINHUA)\n\nSTOCKHOLM - European states' imports of major arms over the five years between 2018 and 2022 surged significantly compared with that of the 2013-2017 period, despite the global arms transfers decreased during the same period, a Swedish research institute said on Monday.\n\nIn its latest report of global arms sales, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said during the 2018-2022 period, the imports of major arms by European states increased by 47 percent from that of the five years between 2013 and 2017, while the global arms transfers decreased by 5.1 percent during the same period.\n\nDuring the stated period, arms imports in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and the Middle East fell by 40 percent, 21 percent, 7.5 percent and 8.8 percent respectively, according to the report\n\nDuring the stated period, arms imports in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and the Middle East fell by 40 percent, 21 percent, 7.5 percent and 8.8 percent respectively, according to the report.\n\nIn the meantime, European North Atlantic Treaty Organization states increased their arms imports by 65 percent mainly due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe report also said that the US dominance of the global arms trade increased, as its share of global arms exports surged from 33 percent to 40 percent while Russia's share fell from 22 percent to 16 percent.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea, Japan and Australia's arms imports soared 61 percent, 171 percent and 23 percent respectively, with the United States as the main supplier to the three countries. In the Middle East, the largest arms supplier is also the United States, providing 54 percent of the region's arms imports.\n\nREAD MORE: EU, NATO, Ukraine to ramp up arms production, procurement\n\nIn this May 20, 2019 file photo, Leopard 2 tanks are seen in a training demonstration in Munster, Germany. (PHOTO / XINHUA)\n\nAs a result of military aid from the United States and many European states following the Ukraine crisis in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme, in a press release.\n\nALSO READ: No end in sight to Ukraine crisis\n\nHeadquartered in Stockholm, SIPRI's research covers international conflicts, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

                    "body": "The United States has benefited from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other regional tensions by boosting its arms sales around the world, while Russia's arms exports plunged, according to the latest report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nThe US share of global arms exports jumped from 33 percent during 2013-17 to 40 percent in 2018-22, while Russia's share declined from 22 percent to 16 percent during those periods. The two countries have long been the world's top two arms exporters.\n\nEuropean countries increased their arms imports by 47 percent from 2013-17 to 2018-22, while the overall global level of international arms transfers decreased by 5.1 percent.\n\nImports have also increased due to increased military spending by European states, including Poland and Norway, and the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, the report said.\n\nThe research institute's report, which was released on Monday, said that arms imports fell 40 percent in Africa, 21 percent in the Americas, 8.8 percent in the Middle East and 7.5 percent in Asia and Oceania. But imports in East Asia rose.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the research institute's Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nEuropean countries want to import more arms quickly following the Russia-Ukraine crisis, while strategic competition has also helped arms sales, he said, citing growing arms imports in East Asia and the Middle East.\n\nFrance, the world's third-largest arms exporter, expanded its share from 7.1 percent in 2013-17 to 11 percent in 2018-22.\n\nRussia's arms exports fell in eight of its 10 biggest markets during those periods. Its arms exports to its largest client, India, declined by 37 percent, but its exports to Egypt increased by 44 percent.\n\nSiemon Wezeman, another senior researcher with the institute's Arms Transfers Programme, said Russia's conflict with Ukraine will further limit its arms exports.\n\n\"This is because Russia will prioritize supply of its armed forces, and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the US and its allies not to buy Russian arms,\" he said.\n\nThe report showed that Ukraine, once a very small buyer, became the world's third-largest arms importer in 2022, trailing Qatar and India.\n\nIt revealed that arms imports by East Asian states grew by 21 percent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Japan increased its imports by 171 percent during those periods, while South Korea expanded its arms imports by 61 percent and Australia by 23 percent. China's arms imports rose by 4.1 percent.\n\nIn a Feb 23 article by The Intercept, a nonprofit news organization, Nick Turse, a fellow at The Nation Institute, criticized the US government for its arms exports.\n\n\"America's weapons consistently stoke conflicts around the world,\" he wrote, citing a 2018 study by the Stimson Center, which found that the US had delivered arms to 27 of 34 countries at war in 2016.\n\nA 2022 analysis by the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a US think tank, found that roughly two-thirds of current conflicts, or 34 out of 46, involve one or more parties armed by the US.\n\nTurse said there has been a clear association in recent years between US-made weapons and human rights abuses in some countries, and the spread of arms to terrorist groups like the Islamic State and criminal gangs in Central America.\n\nA nationwide poll last year by the University of Maryland found bipartisan support for more oversight of US arms exports. About 60 percent of Democrats, 61 percent of independents and 56 percent of Republicans said they want US arms sales of more than $14 million to be approved by a congressional majority.",

                    "body": "Unlike Europe, all other continents have seen a decline in imports over the last five years.\n\nArms imports into Europe almost doubled in 2022, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said Monday.\n\nWith a 93 percent jump compared to the year before, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\nALSO READ: US, NATO role in Ukraine risks 'catastrophic consequences' - Russia\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nExcluding Ukraine, European imports have nevertheless already risen 35 percent in 2022, according to SIPRI data.\n\nUkraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 percent of arms transfers to Europe and eight percent of world deliveries overall, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to put a dollar-value as many contracts are opaque, the global arms trade totals above $100 billion a year, and SIPRI said last year that total military expenditures had exceeded $2 trillion for the first time.\n\nEstimated military expenditures for 2022 by SIPRI will be released in April.\n\nThe surge in imports to Ukraine accelerated an already rising trend, as European states had already begun re-arming in the light of rising tension with Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nEuropean states have either \"already ordered or are planning to\" weapons ranging from \"submarines to combat aircraft, from drones to anti-tank missiles, from rifles to radars\", Wezeman said.\n\n\"Everything is being looked at, because the idea is to strengthen military capacity through the whole spectrum of available military technology.\"\n\nALSO READ: PICS: Police destroy over 18 000 illegal firearms in bid to curb gun violence\n\nThe EU, which is currently fine-tuning a plan to supply Ukraine with millions of shells, is also working to increase production locally in Europe.\n\nEU Commissioner Thierry Breton, announced on French radio on Monday a project involving 15 producers in 11 member states.\n\nSIPRI prefers analysing trends over half-decades as a few contracts can tilt yearly figures.\n\nOver the last five years (2018-2022), European imports have increased by 47 percent compared to the previous five years, while world transfers have declined by five percent, it said.\n\nUnlike Europe, all other continents have seen a decline in imports over the last five years.\n\nThere was a marked drop in Africa (-40 percent) and in North and South America (-20 percent), and declines as well in Asia (-7 percent) and the Middle East (-9 percent).\n\nIn another major shift, the Middle East became the leading destination for arms exports over the past year, accounting for 32 percent of the world total.\n\nIt jumped ahead of Asia-Oceania, which was in first place for years but fell to second in 2022, with 30 percent of the total and with Europe closing in with 27 percent.\n\nChina is continuing to spend heavily on its military but is increasingly producing its weapons locally, having previously imported heavily from Russia, which leads to reduced exports to Asia, SIPRI said.\n\nALSO READ: Russia's military guarantor of stability - Putin\n\nThe main destinations for arms transfers were Qatar (10 percent of the world total), India (9 percent) and Ukraine (8 percent), followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (7 percent each) and Pakistan (5 percent).\n\nThe world's top five exporters over the past five years remained the United States (40 percent); Russia (16 percent); France (11 percent); China (5 percent); and Germany (4 percent).\n\nBut while the US has seen a lift in exports, \"Russian arms exports are clearly declining,\" Wezeman said, while noting that there were discussions on China becoming a supplier to Russia.",

                    "title": "Surge In Arms Imports To Europe: US Dominance Of Global Arms Trade Increases",
                    "body": "Imports of major arms by European states increased by 47 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, while the global level of international arms transfers decreased by 5.1 per cent. Arms imports fell overall in Africa (-40 per cent), the Americas (-21 per cent), Asia and Oceania (-7.5 per cent) and the Middle East (-8.8 per cent) -- but imports to East Asia and certain states in other areas of high geopolitical tension rose sharply.\n\nThe United States' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent, according to new data on global arms transfers published Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\n'Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level.'\n\nGlobal arms exports have long been dominated by the USA and Russia (consistently the largest and second largest arms exporters for the past three decades). However, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest supplier, France, has narrowed. US arms exports increased by 14 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, and the USA accounted for 40 per cent of global arms exports in 2018-22. Russia's arms exports fell by 31 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22 per cent to 16 per cent, while France's share increased from 7.1 per cent to 11 per cent.\n\nRussian arms exports decreased to 8 of its 10 biggest recipients between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Exports to India, the largest recipient of Russian arms, fell by 37 per cent, while exports to the other 7 decreased by an average of 59 per cent. However, Russian arms exports increased to China (+39 per cent) and Egypt (+44 per cent), and they became Russia's second and third largest recipients.\n\n'It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports. This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the USA and its allies not to buy Russian arms,' said Siemon T. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nFrance's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Most of these exports were to states in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East. India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports in 2018-22, and France displaced the USA as the second largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n'France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'This seems likely to continue, as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia.'\n\nFrom 1991 until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms. As a result of military aid from the USA and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) and the 14th biggest for 2018-22. Ukraine accounted for 2.0 per cent of global arms imports in the five-year period.\n\n'Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nAsia and Oceania received 41 per cent of major arms transfers in 2018-22, a slightly smaller share than in 2013-17. Despite the overall decline in transfers to the region, there were marked increases in some states, and marked decreases in others. Six states in the region were among the 10 largest importers globally in 2018-22: India, Australia, China, South Korea, Pakistan and Japan.\n\nArms imports by East Asian states increased by 21 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Arms imports by China rose by 4.1 per cent, with most coming from Russia. However, the biggest increases in East Asia were by US treaty allies South Korea (+61 per cent) and Japan (+171 per cent). Australia, the largest arms importer in Oceania, increased its imports by 23 per cent.\n\n'Growing perceptions of threats from China and North Korea have driven rising demand for arms imports by Japan, South Korea and Australia, notably including for long-range strike weapons,' said Siemon T. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'The main supplier for all three is the USA.'\n\nIndia remains the world's top arms importer, but its arms imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. This decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs. Imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth largest arms importer in 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier.\n\nThree of the top 10 importers in 2018-22 were in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt. Saudi Arabia was the world's second largest arms importer in 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period. Qatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third biggest arms importer in 2018-22.\n\nThe great majority of arms imports to the Middle East came from the USA (54 per cent), followed by France (12 per cent), Russia (8.6 per cent) and Italy (8.4 per cent). They included more than 260 advanced combat aircraft, 516 new tanks and 13 frigates. Arab states in the Gulf region alone have placed orders for another more than 180 combat aircraft, while 24 have been ordered from Russia by Iran (which received virtually no major arms during 2018-22).\n\nArms imports to South East Asia decreased by 42 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. This decrease was at least partly because states are still absorbing equipment delivered before 2018. The Philippines bucked this trend, with an increase in arms imports of 64 per cent.\n\nEuropean NATO states increased their arms imports by 65 per cent as they sought to strengthen their arsenals in response to a perceived heightened threat from Russia.\n\nThe USA's arms exports to T\u00fcrkiye decreased dramatically between 2013-17 and 2018-22 due to bilateral tensions. T\u00fcrkiye fell from 7th to 27th largest recipient of US arms.\n\nArms imports by states in sub-Saharan Africa fell by 23 per cent, with Angola, Nigeria and Mali the biggest recipients. Russia overtook China as the largest arms supplier to the subregion.\n\nArms imports by three states in the Americas rose significantly: the USA (+31 per cent), Brazil(+48 per cent) and Chile (+56 per cent).\n\nAmong the top seven arms exporters after the USA, Russia and France, five countries saw falling arms exports -- China (-23 per cent), Germany (-35 per cent), the United Kingdom (-35 per cent), Spain (-4.4 per cent) and Israel (-15 per cent) -- while two saw large increases -- Italy (+45 per cent) and South Korea (+74 per cent).",

At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nUkraine has been requesting fighter jets for months to defend its skies and maximize the effectiveness of its combined arms forces during a future counteroffensive. However, multiple Western allies, including the U.S. and Germany, have ruled out sending planes now.\n\nOn March 8 in Stockholm, EU defense ministers agreed to ramp up the supply of ammunition to Ukraine but have yet to reach a \"concrete and formal decision.\"",

                    "body": "Chinese arms sales fell by nearly a quarter in 2018-2022, according to new report\n\nGeopolitical tensions, Covid-19 disruptions were main factors in the decline, analysts say\n\nA drop in China\u2019s arms exports could signal military stockpiling in the country amid surging geopolitical tensions and disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to analysts.\n\nNew figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) compared China\u2019s arms exports over the two most recent five-year periods. The data showed arms exports from 2018-2022 dropped by 23 per cent compared with 2013-2017.\n\nChina\u2019s overall share of global arms exports slipped from 6.3 per cent to 5.2 per cent during the same period, the think tank said in its report.\n\nStill, in 2018-2022, China surpassed Germany to become the world\u2019s fourth biggest exporter of major arms, following the United States, Russia and France.\n\nThe decline in arms exports from China could be a sign that Beijing was focusing more on domestic needs as geopolitical tensions rose, said Ni Lexiong, a professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.\n\n\u201cThe [geopolitical] environment around mainland China is deteriorating, including the Taiwan issue, the border issue with India and, more recently, Sino-Japanese relations,\u201d Ni said. \u201cChina has to be ready for confrontations at all times.\u201d\n\nChina has joined a growing list of nations that have increased defence budgets, with a 7.2 per cent rise in its military expenditure \u2013 the fastest pace in four years \u2013 to about 1.55 trillion yuan (US$224.3 billion) for 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s military imports increased by 4.1 per cent in the 2018 to 2022 period compared with the previous five years, the report said. Russia remained the dominant supplier, accounting for 83 per cent of all Chinese imports. France and Ukraine were in second and third places respectively.\n\nThe report came as Beijing tackles tensions on multiple fronts, especially Taiwan.\n\nBeijing regards Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be reunified with the mainland \u2013 by force if necessary. Few countries recognise the island as an independent state, including the US, however Washington has pledged to support Taipei\u2019s military defence, something Beijing opposes.\n\n\u201cThe current environment is indeed not peaceful,\u201d said Song Zhongping, a former instructor for the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cTherefore, it is very necessary for [China] to strengthen its military reserves, to prepare for war.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the country\u2019s growing needs for its own military resources, analysts said China was particularly affected by Covid-induced global disruptions to military industrial production.\u2018Drawing wolves into house\u2019: China warns Manila against closer US defence ties\n\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, the transport of raw materials and manufactured goods for military products may be suspended, [because of] the shortage of manpower,\u201d Ni said.\n\nChina\u2019s Covid-19 policy may have also stalled military factory output because of constant production shutdowns, he added.\n\nThe volume of Chinese military sales orders would resume as the pandemic subsided, according to Song.\n\nPakistan bought more than half of China\u2019s military exports from 2018-2022, accounting for 54 per cent. Bangladesh and Serbia followed with 12 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively.\n\nAt the International Defence Exhibition in Abu Dhabi earlier this month, China was one of the biggest exhibitors with more than 500 pieces of equipment, including a new military micro drone called the Fengniao, or Hummingbird, an aircraft intended to rival its US counterpart.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s foreign arms market will continue to expand, and many Middle Eastern countries are more interested in Chinese weaponry,\u201d Song said.\n\nLike China, Russia\u2019s arms exports decreased sharply \u2013 falling 31 per cent in the 2018 -2022 period. However, China\u2019s imports from Russia rose 39 per cent in the same period.\n\nBut according to SIPRI, the volume of imports to China from 2020 to 2022 dropped dramatically compared with the 2018 to 2020 period, and the order volume was expected to keep dropping. China was becoming less reliant on Russian imports as it ramped up domestic production of advanced major arms, it said.\n\n\u201cThe war in Ukraine has exposed the weaknesses of Russia\u2019s military armament, which may have partly caused China\u2019s reduced military imports from Russia over the last two years,\u201d Ni said.\n\n\u201cChinese military manufacturing, on the other hand, is considered to be inherited from the Soviet tradition, so it is possible that its market reputation will also be hit.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, China bought nearly half of Ukraine\u2019s military exports \u2013 48 per cent \u2013 from 2018 to 2022, despite a 70 per cent decrease in Ukraine\u2019s arms exports compared with the previous period. Among the purchases were gas turbines and engines for navy destroyers and trainer and combat aircraft.",

                    "body": "Stockholm, March 14 (SocialNews.XYZ) European states' imports of major arms over the five years between 2018 and 2022 surged significantly compared with that of the 2013-2017 period, despite the global arms transfers decreased during the same period, a Swedish research institute said.\n\nIn its latest report of global arms sales, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday said during the 2018-2022 period, the imports of major arms by European states increased by 47 per cent from the five years between 2013 and 2017, while the global arms transfers decreased by 5.1 per cent during the same period.\n\nDuring the stated period, arms imports in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and the Middle East fell by 40 per cent, 21 per cent, 7.5 per cent and 8.8 per cent respectively, according to the report.\n\nMeanwhile, European North Atlantic Treaty Organisation states increased their arms imports by 65 per cent mainly due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nThe report also said that the US dominance of the global arms trade increased, as its share of global arms exports surged from 33 to 40 per cent while Russia's share fell from 22 to 16 per cent.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea, Japan and Australia's arms imports soared 61 per cent, 171 per cent and 23 per cent respectively, with the US as the main supplier to the three countries. In the Middle East, the largest arms supplier is also the US, providing 54 per cent of the region's arms imports.\n\nAs a result of military aid from the US and many European states following the Ukraine crisis in February 2022, Ukraine became the third biggest importer of major arms during 2022.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme, in a press statement.\n\nHeadquartered in Stockholm, SIPRI's research covers international conflicts, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

                    "body": "European states' imports of major arms over the five years between 2018 and 2022 surged significantly compared with that of the 2013-2017 period, despite the global arms transfers decreased during the same period, a Swedish research institute said.\n\nIn its latest report of global arms sales, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday said during the 2018-2022 period, the imports of major arms by European states increased by 47 per cent from the five years between 2013 and 2017, while the global arms transfers decreased by 5.1 per cent during the same period.\n\nDuring the stated period, arms imports in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and the Middle East fell by 40 per cent, 21 per cent, 7.5 per cent and 8.8 per cent respectively, according to the report.\n\nMeanwhile, European North Atlantic Treaty Organisation states increased their arms imports by 65 per cent mainly due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nThe report also said that the US dominance of the global arms trade increased, as its share of global arms exports surged from 33 to 40 per cent while Russia's share fell from 22 to 16 per cent.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea, Japan and Australia's arms imports soared 61 per cent, 171 per cent and 23 per cent respectively, with the US as the main supplier to the three countries. In the Middle East, the largest arms supplier is also the US, providing 54 per cent of the region's arms imports.\n\nAs a result of military aid from the US and many European states following the Ukraine crisis in February 2022, Ukraine became the third biggest importer of major arms during 2022.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme, in a press statement.\n\nHeadquartered in Stockholm, SIPRI's research covers international conflicts, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

                    "body": "Attendees stand by a model of a Qatar Emiri Air Force (French-made) Rafale fighter jet during the Doha International Maritime Defence Exhibition in Qatar's capital Doha, on 21 March 2022 (AFP)\n\nMiddle East and North African countries remained among the world's largest global arms importers in 2022, despite global attention on arms shipments to Ukraine amid Russia's invasion, according to a report published on Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher with the Sipri arms transfers programme, according to a Sipri press statement.\n\n\"Arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,\" Wezeman said.\n\nArms from the US and European countries poured into Ukraine, following Russia's February 2022 invasion of the country. The US alone has provided Ukraine with approximately $27.5 bn in military assistance since the beginning of the Biden administration. Kyiv was the third largest importer of arms globally in 2022.\n\nQatar, a gas-rich country of just three million people, holds the top spot as the world's biggest arms importer as of last year. Shipments of weapons to the country increased by 311 percent between 2013-17 and 2018-22.\n\nDoha is one of the world's largest producers of natural gas. Along with neighbouring Gulf states, its global heft has swelled amid an energy crunch exacerbated by Russia's Ukraine invasion.\n\nIn January, Qatar was designated a major non-Nato ally by US President Joe Biden, opening the path for more arms purchases from the US. In November, the US State Department approved the potential sale of a $1bn anti-drone system to Qatar.\n\nOther Middle Eastern states have not been left out. Saudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer in 2018-22, receiving 9.6 percent of all global arms imports. Egypt, which is facing a debilitating economic crisis that has prevented the import of basic goods, ranked sixth globally for arms imports during that same period.\n\nSipri also noted that while western states have been reluctant to provide Ukraine with major arms for fear of widening its conflict with Russia, they have shown little of the same reservation in the Middle East.\n\nMiddle Eastern states imported more than 260 advanced combat aircraft, 516 new tanks and 13 frigates between 2018-2022. Gulf powers alone have an outstanding order for more than 180 combat aircraft. The Biden administration has ruled out sending fighter jets like the F-16 to Ukraine for fear it could lead to an escalation in the war.\n\n\"Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, Nato states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East,\" Wezeman said.\n\nSipri also noted a drop in Russia's arms exports, with decreases to eight of its 10 biggest recipients between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Russia's arms exports fell by 31 percent in the same period and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22 percent to 16 percent.\n\nThe drop in Russian exports has coincided with an increase from the US by 14 percent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. The US accounted for 40 percent of global arms exports in 2018-22.\n\nSipri, however, noted that France was perhaps the biggest winner from Russia's declining sales, with exports increasing by 44 percent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, mostly to states in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nMiddle East Eye previously reported that Russia was facing supply shortages as a result of the war and had to delay servicing clients. Analysts and diplomats have told MEE that Moscow's poor military performance in Ukraine has hit its ability to pick up new clients in the Gulf region.\n\n\"The lack of quality of Russian weapons systems has been exposed to GCC capitals. There is a clear decline in interest among GCC countries for Russian military gear. They are doubling down on Nato weaponry,\" Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, previously told MEE.\n\nKirsten Fontenrose, a former senior director for Gulf affairs in the Trump administration's National Security Council, previously told MEE that France's arms industry could be the big winner from the war in Ukraine.\n\nFontenrose said buying from France could be a way for rulers in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to beef up their arsenals \"while not rewarding the US for what they see as mistreatment\".\n\nRussia's arms exports to Egypt increased 44 percent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. However, Cairo has more recently suggested it is looking to Washington for arms.\n\nLast year, Egypt backed out of its planned purchase of Russia's Su-35 fighter jet and decided to buy the US F-15.\n\nThe Sipri data also highlights the impact of Turkey's rocky relationship with the US. In 2020, the US sanctioned Turkey's defence industry under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa) for its purchase of Russia's S-400 anti-missile system.\n\nArms exports from Washington to Ankara decreased dramatically between 2013-17 and 2018-22, with Turkey falling from seventh to 27th place as the largest recipient of US arms.",

                    "body": "Saudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer for the 2018-22 period followed by Qatar, Australia and China.\n\nUkraine became the third-largest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) as a result of military aid from the US and many European nations following the Russian invasion in February 2022, the report says.\n\nKyiv, which had imported few major arms since Ukrainian independence in 1991 till the end of 2021, was the 14th biggest overall importer during 2018-22, it adds.\n\nPrime Minister Modi had last month said that India had \"rejuvenated\" its defence production sector in the last eight to nine years and was looking at increasing its export of military hardware from $1.5 billion to $5 billion by 2024-25.\n\n\"India's tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports,\" the Sipri report says.\n\n\"With 11 per cent of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-2022, a position it has held for the period 1993-2022. It retained this position even though its arms imports dropped by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22.\"\n\nThe decrease, the report says, can be attributed to factors such as India's slow and complex arms procurement process, efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms that are designed and produced domestically.\n\nImports by Pakistan, the world's eighth-largest arms importer in 2018-22, increased 14 per cent, with China as the main supplier, the report says.\n\nArms imports by China rose 4.1 per cent, most of it coming from Russia. Russia was the biggest supplier of arms to India during 2013-17 and 2018-22 but its share of total Indian arms imports fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent.\n\nFrance emerged as the second-largest supplier in the 2018-22 period, accounting for 29 per cent of India's imports.\n\nDuring 2018-22 India was the biggest arms export market for Russia, France and Israel. According to the report, the US, Russia and France were the world's three biggest arms exporters in 2018-22 with a 40 per cent, 16 per cent and 11 per cent share of the global market, respectively.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan were among the 10 largest arms importers globally in 2018-22.",

                    "body": "DUBAI -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt were classified among the top 10 global arms importers from 2018 to 2022, according to a report published Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nArms imports by Middle Eastern and North African countries in those five years were overall 8.8% lower than the previous five-year period from 2013 to 2017, and the United States accounted for 54% of them.\n\nFrance (12%), Russia (8.6%) and Italy (8.4%) came after Washington as the top suppliers of weaponry to the region.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer during that period and received 9.6% of all arms imports, second only to India at 11%, according to SIPRI's Trends in International Arms Transfers 2022.\n\nThe kingdom received the vast majority, 78%, of its imports from the United States, which included the delivery of 91 combat aircraft, hundreds of land-attack missiles and over 20,000 guided bombs.\n\nFrance and Spain fell far behind the United States as Saudi Arabia's second- and third-largest arms suppliers, providing 6.4% and 4.9% of imports respectively.\n\nQatar was ranked as the third-largest weapons importer, taking in 6.4% of the world's arms. Its top supplier was also the United States, accounting for less than half of its imports at 42%, followed by France (29%) and Italy (14%).\n\nIn the last five years, Qatar imported 36 combat aircraft from France, 36 from the United Kingdom, and three frigate warships from Italy.\n\nEgypt came in at sixth position, accounting for 4.5% of global arms imports during the five-year period. Its main supplier was Russia at 34%, followed by Italy and France both at 19%.\n\nEastern Mediterranean countries like Egypt notably increased their naval capabilities between 2018 and 2022 as a result of ongoing maritime disputes, SIPRI stated.\n\nEgypt, Israel and Turkey have received a number of frigates from leading European arms exporters, with the latter two having placed orders for submarines from Germany that are expected to arrive starting this year.\n\nThe United States, the world's top arms exporter, barely made it as one of the top 10 arms importers, coming in at 10th place. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait followed immediately behind the United States in the 11th and 12th positions respectively, with Washington providing the majority of their imports at 66% for the UAE and 78% for Kuwait.\n\nMiddle Eastern countries made up more than a fourth of the top 40 global arms importers from 2018 to 2022, according to SIPRI.\n\nIran, on the other hand, has imported a very low amount of arms compared to its Gulf neighbors since 1993, with its imports from 2018 to 2022 being nearly zero, according to the think tank.\n\nLast year Iran placed an order for 24 combat aircraft from Russia, which was its first significant procurement of combat aircraft since the early 1990s. Both countries are under US and European sanctions.\n\nMiddle East and North African countries rank among the top 40 greatest global arms importers from 2018 to 2022, with over 32% of the market share. Here is how MENA countries ranked on SIPRI's index:\n\nIsrael was the Middle East and North Africa's greatest exporter of weapons at 10th with 2.3% of global arms exports from 2018 to 2022.\n\nTurkey ranked 12th with 1.1% of exports, the UAE 18th at 0.4% and Jordan 25th accounting for 0.2% of global arms exports.\n\nIn the case of Turkey, SIPRI reported a sharp decline in US arms exports to its NATO ally. Turkey has become the 27th largest recipient of US arms between 2018-2022, dropping from the seventh largest between 2013-2017 as a result of worsening bilateral relations.\n\nWashington expelled Turkey from its F-35 stealth fighter jet program in 2019 over Ankara's purchase of Russian-made S-400s.\n\nTurkey's bid to buy new F-16 fighter jets and modernization kits also faces an uphill battle in the US Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey's arms exports increased by 69% from the 2013-2017 period, the report noted.\n\nThe top three global arms exporters were the United States, dominating 40% of the market share during the five-year period, with Russia and France falling behind at 16% and 11%.",

                    "body": "India's arms imports fell 11% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, but the country is still the world's top importer of military hardware, a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said on Monday. The report comes at a time when India has sharpened its focus on achieving self-reliance in defence manufacturing.\n\nIndia's share of the global arms imports was the highest in the past five years at 11%, followed by Saudi Arabia (9.6%), Qatar (6.4%), Australia (4.7%) and China (4.7%), according to data published by the think tank that measures weapons imports over five-year periods.\n\nThe latest report is in line with what last year's Sipri report said. In 2022, it said India's imports fell 21% between 2012-16 and 2017-21, but that the country was still the world's biggest arms importer. The new report said the reasons for the decline in India's imports included attempts to replace imports with local makes and a complex procurement process.\n\nIndia has taken a raft of measures over the past four to five years to boost self-reliance in defence. These include creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware, increasing foreign direct investment from 49% to 74%, and notifying hundreds of weapons and systems that cannot be imported and are planned to be indigenised over the next five to six years.\n\nAround \u20b91 lakh crore was set aside for domestic procurement in this year's defence budget, compared to \u20b984,598 crore, \u20b970,221 crore and \u20b951,000 crore in the three previous years.\n\n\"The Indian military is large and will continue to import weapons and systems for some more years. The decline in India's arms imports is a significant achievement. Imports will drop further as indigenisation efforts succeed,\" said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.\n\nThe ranking system is dynamic as it depends on how orders are placed in a particular year. For instance, the 2019 Sipri report said India was no longer the world's largest importer of weapons, a position it held for decades, with Saudi Arabia topping the global share of arms imports between 2014 and 2018. Saudi Arabia accounted for 12% of the global share of arms imports in that period, followed by India in second place with a 9.5% share.\n\nAccording to new Sipri data, the US was the world's topmost military exporter in the past five years, accounting for 40% of global exports, followed by Russia (16%), France (11%), China (5.2%) and Germany (4.2%). US arms exports jumped 14% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, while Russia's fell 31% during the same period. Russia's imports to India fell 37%.\n\n\"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports. This is because Russia will prioritise supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the USA and its allies not to buy Russian arms,\" said Siemon T Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nOn March 3, chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan said self-reliance in defence manufacturing was one of the biggest lessons for India from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the three services will have to be the driving force for the campaign to succeed.\n\n\"We can't be dependent on military supplies from outside. We have taken some baby steps towards self-reliance in the last two to three years. The government has taken a large number of initiatives to boost it. I think for this campaign to succeed, the three services will have to be the driving force,\" Chauhan said at the Raisina Dialogue.\n\nUkraine was the third biggest importer of major arms in 2022, and the 14th biggest during 2018-22, Sipri said.\n\nFrance's arms exports jumped 44% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, with India receiving 30% of its exports during the past five years, the report said, adding that France had displaced the US as the second largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India,\" said Wezeman.",

                    "body": "Arms imports into Europe almost doubled in 2022, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said yesterday.\n\nWith a 93 percent jump compared to the year before, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said. \"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nExcluding Ukraine, European imports have nevertheless already risen 35 percent in 2022, according to SIPRI data. Ukraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 percent of arms transfers to Europe and eight percent of world deliveries overall, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found. The deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.\n\nThe world's top five exporters over the past five years remained the United States (40 percent); Russia (16 percent); France (11 percent); China (5 percent); and Germany (4 percent).\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.",

                    "title": "India Tops Global List in Arms Imports, Belies Govt's Tall Claims of 'Atmanirbharta'",
                    "body": "Chandigarh: India continues to top the global list of defence equipment importers, despite grandiose claims by the Union government of having rapidly localised its materiel procurements under its much-touted 'Atmanirbharta' initiative to achieve self-sufficiency in this regard.\n\nAccording to the March 2023 report by Sweden's Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) entitled Trends in International Arms Transfers, 2022, India accounted for 11% of all weapon imports in the 2018-22 period, down from 12% in the 2013-17 period. Saudi Arabia (9.6%), Qatar (6.4%), Australia (4.7%) and China (4.6%) followed India in terms of procurement of foreign defence equipment in the four-year period till 2022.\n\nAlongside, India's share of defence equipment exports, also unquestioningly touted by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), which equalled 0.2% in SIPRI's previous 2022 report, had fallen off its charts in its current analysis. In February, at AeroIndia-2023 in Bangalore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated that his government's vaunted intent to enhance five-fold India's annual defence exports to $5 billion by 2024-25, up from $1.5 billion presently.\n\nThe 12-page report by SIPRI - known for researching conflicts, global armaments trade and related military and security issues and activity - reveals that India's position as the world's largest arms importer had endured between 1992-2022, despite an overall reduction of 11% from 2013 onwards.\n\n\"India's tensions with Pakistan and China, largely drive its demand for arms imports,\" declares SIPRI's report. Expectedly, Russia remained India's largest materiel provider from 2013 to 2022, even though overall purchases from Moscow had dropped from 64% to 45% during this decade. According to SIPRI, it was due to India widening its overseas armaments supply pool, increased local production and more recently - since early 2022 - 'constraints' on Russian weapon exports as a consequence of widespread sanctions on Moscow for invading Ukraine.\n\nMilitary exports by Pakistan, on the other hand, increased by 14% between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and accounted for 3.7% of the global total. China supplied over three quarters (77%) of Pakistan's arms imports in 2018-22, as per SIPRI.\n\nFurthermore, SIPRI maintains that US arms exports accounted for 40% of all global military commerce between 2018-22, some 14% higher than the preceding four-year period. French defence exports for the analogous period too had increased by 44% between 2013 and 2022, while Russian (by 31%), Chinese (by 23%) and German (by 35%) materiel sales had declined for the corresponding years by 31%, 23% and 35% respectively, declares SIPRI. Interestingly, SIPRI confirms that between them the US and France controlled 51% of the world's entire arms trade between 2018-22, up from 40.1% over the previous four years, ending 2017.\n\nThe SIPRI report says that Ukraine has predictably emerged as the third largest importer of major arms in 2022, after Qatar and India, accounting for 2% of global arms sales. And with 35% of materiel exports to Ukraine, the US topped the list of 29 states which had supplied weaponry and related equipment to Kyiv following the February 2022 Russian invasion; Poland with 17%, Germany with 11%, Britain with 10% and the Czech Republic with 4.4% were some of the others to bolster Ukraine's military capability.\n\n'India to remain a net importer in long-term'\n\nIncidentally, parliament was told on Monday, March 13, that expenditure on defence procurement from foreign sources decreased from 46% in 2018-19 to 36.7% as of December 2022. The minister of state for defence, Ajay Bhatt, told the Rajya Sabha this in a written reply.\n\nBut a cross-section of military veterans and analysts said India would remain a 'net materiel importer' in the medium- to long-term, as it struggled, shorn of official hype, to make 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' a success in locally designing and manufacturing military platforms and equipment for all three services.\n\nBrigadier Rahul Bhonsle (retired) of the Security Risks Consultancy in Delhi told The Wire that, for starters, India was poised to acquire 114 combat aircraft for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and at least 26 more for the Indian Navy (IN) for deployment aboard the newly commissioned aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, which together were worth an estimated $45 billion.\n\nAll three services, he said, were also primed to acquire 18 armed General Atomics-Aeronautics Systems Incorporated (GA-ASI) MQ-9B Reaper/Sea Guardian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - down for an earlier requirement of 30 units - for around $2-1.5 billion, alongside other sundry purchases that would collectively confirm India's future pre-eminence as one of the world's leading weapon importers. \"Importing defence equipment will remain a reality for many years to come, despite best efforts at indigenising defence needs,\" Brig Bhonsle added.\n\nAttempts by the MoD at sourcing military kit domestically, by embargoing the import of some 410 platforms and associated apparatus from 2020 onwards, were yet to pay dividends, industry and military officials said. But as a three-star retired IAF officer observed, this laudable objective had been 'side-tracked' by 'grandiose' claims by not only the service chiefs, but also MoD officials, of having already achieved widespread Atmanirbharta. But the reality, he cautioned, was starkly different.\n\nThe former fighter pilot likened the ongoing Atmanirbhar narrative to the literary folktale of the Emperor's New Clothes, in which all concerned people feared to point out the obvious truth that the 'Make in India' initiative was not an 'instant' enterprise and would take an extended period and large scale investment to even partially fructify. \"It (Atmanirbharta) will also necessitate a more flexible policy approach to implement in order to deliver results,\" the officer stated and warned against the MoDs prevailing 'hidebound and impractical procedures' which were 'wholly unsuited' to this endeavour.\n\nBesides, Indian defence equipment exports, especially of local military platforms, too were afflicted by problems of quality control. The recent grounding of the entire fleet of some 300-odd Dhruv Advanced Light helicopters (ALH) and its variants- flaunted often as a 'hot' export possibility- after one of them ditched into the Arabian Sea last week. This is bound to be a setback to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) which designed and manufactured the 5.8 tonne, twin-engine rotary platform.\n\nOfficials said over 20-odd ALH and its derivatives had been involved in accidents since HAL began series producing them in 2002. There have been several military personnel and civilian deaths too in those accidents.\n\nNot included in this tally of accidents were four of seven ALHs which had crashed soon after HAL exported them to the Ecuador Air Force (EAF) in 2008-09 for $42.5 million. These crashes led to Ecuador eventually terminating its ALH contract with HAL in October 2015, in a major setback to what was then the first-ever major export of an indigenous military platform.\n\nAt the time Ecuadorian defence minister Fernando Cordero had told reporters in the capital Quito, that two of these four crashes were due to 'mechanical failure', and that the remaining three Dhruvs had subsequently been grounded by the EAF. HAL, for its part, countered those claims by maintaining that 'human error' was responsible for two of the four Dhruv crashes.\n\nThe termination of the ALH purchases by the Ecuadorians was, without doubt, a serious stumbling block for HAL in a field where flight safety remains the primary concern, and where competition from established Western helicopter manufacturers in the US and Europe existed. The recent grounding of ALHs - and not for the first time - also comes soon after HAL chief C.B. Anathkrishnan had claimed at DefExpo-2022 in Gandhinagar last October that ALH and its derivatives had 'immense' export potential.\n\n\"Considering the government's heightened pitch for exporting Indian defence equipment and platforms, the ALH still remains a work in progress and will have to earn all prospective importers' trust in its operational efficiency before securing customers,\" said a senior industry official. Its reliability will be the key to its success as a saleable product, he cautioned, declining to be identified.",

                    "body": "Russia Is Still India's Largest Arms Supplier But Its Position Under 'Pressure': SIPRI Report Monday, March 13, 2023 by Indian Defence News\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, France has displaced US as India's second largest arms supplier while half of China's arms exports went to Pakistan\n\nNew Delhi: Russia continues to be the largest arms supplier of India, but its share in New Delhi's total arms imports has come down to 45 percent during the period 2018-2022 from 64 percent earlier, according to the latest data on international transfers of major arms by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). SIPRI is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.\n\nAccording to the SIPRI data, which was released Monday, India continues to be the world's largest arms importer and the largest recipient of Russian arms. The report also noted that the demand for arms in India is on a rise due to the ongoing tensions with China and Pakistan.\n\n\"India's tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports. With an 11 per cent share of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-22, a position it has held for the period 1993-2022,\" said the report titled 'Trends in International Arms Transfers, 2022'.\n\nThe report also said imports of weaponry by India from Russia, France, the US and others have slowed down by 11 per cent in 2018-22 compared to 2013-2017. This is mainly because of the government's 'Atmanirbhar' or self-reliance mission in defence manufacturing, slow and complex arms procurement process and efforts to diversify its arms suppliers.\n\nThe SIPRI data also showed that while Russia continues to be topmost arms seller to India, its share has gone down owing to strong competition from other suppliers like France and the US, increased arms production under the indigenous route and due to the ongoing Ukraine war.\n\nThe five largest arms importers in 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China. Together, these five countries accounted for 36 per cent of the world's arms imports, said SIPRI.\n\nSiemon T. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme, said: \"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports. This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the USA and its allies not to buy Russian arms.\"\n\nFrances Displaces US As Second-Largest Arms Supplier To India\n\nFrance has replaced the US as India's second-largest arms supplier due to the import of 62 combat aircraft and four submarines. India's import of weaponry from France increased by 489 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, the SIPRI data noted.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example ... This seems likely to continue, as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nDuring the period 2018-22, US, Russia, France, China and Germany emerged as the top five arms exporters to the world.\n\n\"US and French arms exports rose between 2013-17 and 2018-22, while Russian, Chinese and German arms exports fell,\" said SIPRI.\n\nHalf of Chinese Arms Exports Went To Pakistan\n\nAccording to SIPRI's research, China accounted for 5.2 per cent of total global arms exports in 2018-22. But Beijing's arms exports decreased by 23 percent between 2013-17 and 2018-22.\n\n\"The vast majority of Chinese arms exports (80 per cent) went to states in Asia and Oceania. China delivered major arms to 46 states in 2018-22, but over half of its arms exports (54 per cent) went to just one state -- Pakistan,\" the report said.\n\nArms imports by Pakistan increased by 14 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and accounted for 3.7 per cent of the total. China supplied over three quarters (77 per cent) of Pakistan's arms imports in 2018-22, the report showed.\n\nIt also noted that China is increasingly becoming \"less reliant\" on Russian imports owing to the ramping up of domestic production in that country of advanced major arms.\n\nUkraine Is Now World's Third Largest Arms Importer\n\nThe SIPRI report also noted that Ukraine, which imported a handful of arms between 1991 to 2021-end, turned out to be the world's third largest arms importer due to the war, which began in February 2022.\n\n\"From 1991 until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported a few major arms. As a result of military aid from the USA and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) and the 14th biggest for 2018-22. Ukraine accounted for 2.0 per cent of global arms imports in the five-year period,\" it said.\n\nThe report added: \"Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,\" said Wezeman.\n\nx Next You are viewing Most Recent Post Comments",

                    "body": "The decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs, the report said.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said the five largest arms importers in the world during 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.\n\nThe five largest arms exporters were the United States, Russia, France, China and Germany.\n\nThe imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth-largest arms importer during 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier, the report said.\n\nIt said France's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and most of these exports were to countries in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East.\n\nThe report said India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports during 2018-22 and France displaced the US as the second-largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India for example,\" said Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\n\"This seems likely to continue as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,\" he said.\n\nThe report compared two five-year periods and noted that Russian arms supplies to India are declining.\n\nIt said the United States' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent, while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Wezeman.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,\" he added.\n\nThe report said three of the top 10 importers during 2018-22 were in the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer during 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period, it said.\n\nQatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third-biggest arms importer during 2018-22, it added.",

                    "body": "Arms imports into Europe almost doubled last year, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said yesterday.\n\nSoaring 93 percent from 2021, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said.\n\nThe rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" SIPRI senior researcher Pieter Wezeman said.\n\nUkraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms, but last year it quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 percent of arms transfers to Europe and 8 percent of world deliveries overall, SIPRI's data showed.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armored vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.",

In the Middle East, the largest arms supplier is also the United States, providing 54 percent of the region's arms imports.\n\nAs a result of military aid from the United States and many European states following the Ukraine crisis in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme, in a press release.\n\nHeadquartered in Stockholm, SIPRI's research covers international conflicts, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

                    "body": "Helsinki, Mar 13 (AP) Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has led to a substantial flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe made Ukraine the world's third largest importer of arms in 2022, a Swedish think tank said Monday.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, reported that from 1991, when Ukraine became independent amid the fall of the Soviet Union, until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms.\n\nAlso Read | China's 'Digital Silk Road' in South Africa, US Raises Questions on Spying.\n\nBut Moscow's invasion on Feb 24 last year markedly changed that. Only Qatar -- which has dramatically ramped up its arms purchasing in the past decade -- and India imported more arms in the year, SIPRI said in its report on global arms transfers.\n\nPieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program noted that even as arms transfers declined globally last year, \"those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states.\" He said that following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, \"faster.\"\n\nAlso Read | Russia President Vladimir Putin May Attend G20 Summit in India, Though No Decision Yet, Says Kremlin.\n\nSIPRI said that the export of arms has long been dominated by the United States and Russia with the two countries being the largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nHowever, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest arms supplier, France, has narrowed. The think tank said it was likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports due to Moscow's need to prioritize supplying its own armed forces and low demand from other states due to trade sanctions.\n\nSIPRI's data showed that U.S. arms exports increased by 14% between the periods 2013-17 and 2018-22, and Washington accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018-22.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's arms exports fell by 31% between the two periods, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22% to 16%, while France's share increased from 7.1% to 11%.\n\nSIPRI, established in 1966, is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.

                    "body": "The report noted that Russian arms supplies to India are declining. (Representational)\n\nIndia remained the world's top arms importer, but its imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, according to a report released on Monday by Stockholm-based defence think-tank SIPRI.\n\nThe decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs, the report said.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said the five largest arms importers in the world during 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.\n\nThe five largest arms exporters were the United States, Russia, France, China and Germany.\n\nThe imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth-largest arms importer during 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier, the report said.\n\nIt said France's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and most of these exports were to countries in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East.\n\nThe report said India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports during 2018-22 and France displaced the US as the second-largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India for example,\" said Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\n\"This seems likely to continue as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,\" he said.\n\nThe report compared two five-year periods and noted that Russian arms supplies to India are declining.\n\nIt said the United States' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent, while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Wezeman.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,\" he added.\n\nThe report said three of the top 10 importers during 2018-22 were in the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer during 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period, it said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nQatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third-biggest arms importer during 2018-22, it added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\n\nFeatured Video Of The DayRRR At Oscars 2023: Naatu Naatu Supremacy - Blockbuster Hit Wins Best Original Song",

                    "body": "NEW DELHI: India continues to languish in the strategically-vulnerable as well as embarrassing position of being the world's largest arms importer, accounting for 11% of the total global imports in 2018-2022, despite the government's continuing thrust on \"Make in India\" in defence production.\n\nThe latest data on international arms transfers released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday shows Russia remains the largest weapons supplier to India, with 45% of the total imports in the 2018-2022 timeframe, though its share is declining.\n\nFrance accounts for 29%, displacing the US from the second position by riding on deals like the Rs 59,000 crore one for 36 Rafale fighters. The US, in turn, notched up 11% of the total weapon sales to India.\n\nIndia is followed by Saudi Arabia (9.6%), Qatar (6.4%), Australia (4.7%), China (4.6%), Egypt (4.5%), South Korea (3.7%) and Pakistan (3.7%) among the top 10 arms importers.\n\nThe top 10 arms exporters, in turn, are the US (40%), Russia (16%), France (11%), China (5.2%), Germany (4.2%), Italy (3.8%), UK (3.2%), Spain (2.6%), South Korea (2.4%) and Israel (2.3%). China, incidentally, accounts for 77% of the arms supplies to Pakistan.\n\nIndia, which is the world's third largest military spender after the US and China, has taken a series of steps towards achieving 'atmanirbharta' (self-reliance) in defence production. These range from the notification of four \"positive indigenisation lists\" and increase in the FDI limit to creating \"a favourable environment\" for Indian vendors and earmarking a record 75% of the defence capital procurement budget for the domestic industry in 2023-24.\n\nOn Monday, junior defence minister Ajay Bhatt told Rajya Sabha the expenditure on defence procurement from foreign sources has reduced from 46% of the overall expenditure in 2018-19 to 36.7% as per data till December 2022 due to the various policy initiatives.\n\nBut a lot more clearly needs to be done if India has to meet its oft-repeated ambitious target of achieving a domestic turnover of Rs 1,75,000 crore in the defence and aerospace sector, including exports of Rs 35,000 crore, by 2024-25.\n\nAs per SIPRI data, India has been the world's largest arms importer since 1993. This underlines India's persisting failure to build a strong defence-industrial base with much larger private sector participation as well as the poor performance by the DRDO, defence PSUs and ordnance factories over the years.\n\nThe lack of concrete long-term plans to systematically build military capabilities, with proper inter-Service prioritization, also remains a major problem. This is reflected in existing major operational shortages in fighter jets, submarines, helicopters, anti-tank guided missiles, night-fighting capabilities and the like.\n\nThe SIPRI data does show India's arms imports dropped by 11% between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022. \"The decrease can be attributed to several factors including India's slow and complex arms procurement process, efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms that are designed and produced domestically,\" it said.\n\nRussia was the largest supplier of arms to India in both the 2013-2017 and 2018-2022 timeframes, but its share of total Indian arms imports fell from 64% to 45%. \"Russia's position as India's main arms supplier is under pressure due to strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production and, since 2022, the constraints on Russia's arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine,\" SIPRI said.",

                    "body": "The United States has increased arms sales, with its share rising to 40%.\n\nRussia's share of global arms exports declined sharply in the most recent five-year period, as Western sanctions against Moscow and the Kremlin's own need to conserve weaponry for its ongoing war effort in Ukraine limited sales abroad, new data from an influential research group showed.\n\nRussia's share of global arms exports declined from 22 percent in the 2013-17 period to 16 percent in 2018-22, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published on March 13.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States remained the global leader in arms exports, with its share rising to 40 percent from 33 percent in the same five-year period.\n\n\"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports,\" said Pieter Wezeman, a senior SIPRI researcher.\n\n\"This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces, and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the U.S.A. and its allies not to buy Russian arms,\" he added.\n\nSIPRI noted that arms exports worldwide have long been dominated by the United States and Russia, with the two countries ranking first and second over the past three decades.\n\nBut Russia's gap over France, the third-biggest exporter, narrowed, with Paris's share rising to 11 percent from 7.1 percent.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example,\" Wezeman said. \"This seems likely to continue, as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia.\"\n\nU.S. arms exports rose 14 percent from the 2013-17 period to 2018-22, while Russia's exports tumbled 31 percent. France's exports rose 44 percent, mainly to states in Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East.\n\nIndia received 30 percent of France's arms in the recent five-year period, surpassing the United States as the second-largest supplier of weaponry to New Delhi.\n\nRussian remained the largest supplier to India of arms exports and managed to increase sales to two large nations -- China by 39 percent and Egypt by 44 percent over the period.\n\nUkraine became the third-largest arms importer globally in 2022 as Kyiv continues to battle against the full-scale invasion by Russian forces, a major change from the nation's actions over previous decades.\n\n\"From 1991 until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms,\" the report said. \"As a result of military aid from the U.S.A. and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the third-biggest importer of major arms during 2022 [after Qatar and India].\"\n\nIt said Ukraine accounted for 2 percent of global arms imports in the five-year period.\n\nEuropean NATO nations hiked their arms imports 65 percent \"as they sought to strengthen their arsenals in response to a perceived heightened threat from Russia,\" the report said.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster,\" Wezeman added.\n\nThe European increase came as the global level of international arms transfers dipped 5.1 percent over the five-year period.",

                    "body": "The five largest arms exporters were the United States, Russia, France, China and Germany\n\nIndia remained the world's top arms importer, but its imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, according to a report released on Monday by Stockholm-based defence think-tank SIPRI.\n\nThe decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs, the report said.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said the five largest arms importers in the world during 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.\n\nThe five largest arms exporters were the United States, Russia, France, China and Germany.\n\nAlso Read -- NIA files charge sheet against juvenile, six others in terror plot case in Manipur\n\nThe imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth-largest arms importer during 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier, the report said.\n\nIt said France's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and most of these exports were to countries in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East.\n\nThe report said India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports during 2018-22 and France displaced the US as the second-largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India for example,\" said Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\n\"This seems likely to continue as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,\" he said.\n\nThe report compared two five-year periods and noted that Russian arms supplies to India are declining.\n\nIt said the United States' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent, while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Wezeman.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,\" he added.\n\nThe report said three of the top 10 importers during 2018-22 were in the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer during 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period, it said.\n\nQatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third-biggest arms importer during 2018-22, it added.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine that has led to a substantial flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe made Ukraine the world's third largest importer of arms in 2022, a Swedish think tank said Monday.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, reported that from 1991, when Ukraine became independent amid the fall of the Soviet Union, until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms.\n\nBut Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 last year markedly changed that. Only Qatar -- which has dramatically ramped up its arms purchasing in the past decade -- and India imported more arms in the year, SIPRI said in its report on global arms transfers.\n\nRUSSIANS WARNED OF NUCLEAR ATTACK AFTER HACKERS BREAK IN TO COUNTRY'S TV SERVICE\n\nPieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program noted that even as arms transfers declined globally last year, \"those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states.\" He said that following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, \"faster.\"\n\nSIPRI said that the export of arms has long been dominated by the United States and Russia with the two countries being the largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nBELARUSIAN COMMANDER IN UKRAINE SAYS 'MATTER OF TIME' BEFORE HE HAS TO FIGHT HIS OWN COUNTRY IN RUSSIA'S WAR\n\nHowever, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest arms supplier, France, has narrowed. The think tank said it was likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports due to Moscow's need to prioritize supplying its own armed forces and low demand from other states due to trade sanctions.\n\nSIPRI's data showed that U.S. arms exports increased by 14% between the periods 2013-17 and 2018-22, and Washington accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018-22.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's arms exports fell by 31% between the two periods, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22% to 16%, while France's share increased from 7.1% to 11%.\n\nSIPRI, established in 1966, is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

                    "body": "The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said the five largest arms importers in the world during 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China. The five largest arms exporters were the United States, Russia, France, China and Germany.India remained the world's top arms importer, but its imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, according to a report released on Monday by Stockholm-based defence think-tank SIPRI. The decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs, the report said.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said the five largest arms importers in the world during 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.\n\nThe five largest arms exporters were the United States, Russia, France, China and Germany.\n\nThe imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth-largest arms importer during 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier, the report said.\n\nIt said France's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and most of these exports were to countries in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East.\n\nThe report said India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports during 2018-22 and France displaced the US as the second-largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India for example,\" said Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\n\"This seems likely to continue as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,\" he said.\n\nThe report compared two five-year periods and noted that Russian arms supplies to India are declining.\n\nIt said the United States' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent, while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Wezeman.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,\" he added.\n\nThe report said three of the top 10 importers during 2018-22 were in the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer during 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period, it said.\n\nQatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third-biggest arms importer during 2018-22, it added.",

                    "body": "Russia's arms exports have declined by 31% over the past five years, but the country remains the world's second\u00ad-largest weapons exporter after the US, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has claimed in its new fact sheet.While global arms exports have long been dominated by the US and Russia, the gap between the two in this field has grown significantly, according to the Swedish think tank.He added that the beginning of the ongoing Russian special operation in Ukraine has complicated SIPRI's process of obtaining such information.According to Leonkov, the figures that SIPRI uses in its reports reflect the annual financial transactions that take place under certain contracts, clinched for the period of several years, which means that the cost of the contracts may change.When asked why SIPRI reports often draw flak from Russian analysts, Leonkov explained that the Swedish think tank mainly focuses on a state's financial affairs and the quantity of military hardware, which he said is a wrong approach.\"This is not a true indicator of an army's combat capability because military equipment and level of training of the armed forces can be in different conditions. Referring to a large quantity of weapons is not always a guarantee of a reliable analysis about a battle-ready army,\" the expert pointed out.",

                    "body": "Moscow's share of global arms exports has plunged sharply in the recent five-year period. Ukraine on the other hand, became the 3rd largest arms importer.\n\nIn the midst of the Russia-Ukraine war, Moscow's share of global arms exports has plunged sharply in the recent five-year period. According to Radio Free Europe, the barrage of western sanctions imposed on Russia following the commencement of Russia's invasion of the eastern European country has contributed to the decline. The Kremlin's own need to conserve weaponry amid the ongoing war can be considered another reason for the decline in the sales of weapons. The deplorable data of the Russian shares was shared by an influential research group.\n\nAs per the data, Russia's share of global arms exports has declined from 22 percent in the 2013-2017 period to 16 percent in 2018-2022.\n\nThe data was released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on March 13. While Russia witnessed a major decline, the United States continued to remain the global leader in arms exports. As per the reports, the United States' global arms exports rose from 33% to 40% in the same five-year period. \"Likely, the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports,\" said Pieter Wezeman, a senior SIPRI researcher. \"This is because Russia will prioritise supplying its armed forces, and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the U.S.A. and its allies not to buy Russian arms,\" he added. Meanwhile, Russian archnemesis Ukraine became the world's third biggest arms importer in the year 2022.\n\nIn the report, the Stockholm International Research Institute stated that from 1991, when the war-stricken country became independent, to 2021, Ukraine imported a few major arms. However, things changed drastically following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24. The eastern European country currently stands at the number three spot. While Wezeman stated that there has been a global decline in arms transfer, the transactions in Europe have drastically increased amidst the war.\n\nAccording to the data, the gap between the arms exports between the US and Russia has widened significantly. On the other hand, the gap between Russia and France has narrowed significantly as well. \"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example,\" Wezeman said. \"This seems likely to continue, as, by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,\" he added.",

                    "body": "New Delhi, Mar 13 (PTI) India remained the world's top arms importer, but its imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, according to a report released on Monday by Stockholm-based defence think-tank SIPRI.\n\nThe decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs, the report said.\n\nAlso Read | West Bengal Weather Forecast: Rainfall, Thunderstorms Likely From March 14, Says Met Department.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said the five largest arms importers in the world during 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.\n\nThe five largest arms exporters were the United States, Russia, France, China and Germany.\n\nAlso Read | Ministry of Education Says Around 9.3 Lakh Out-of-School Children at Elementary Level, Maximum in Uttar Pradesh, More Boys Than Girls.\n\nThe imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth-largest arms importer during 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier, the report said.\n\nIt said France's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and most of these exports were to countries in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East.\n\nThe report said India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports during 2018-22 and France displaced the US as the second-largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India for example,\" said Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\n\"This seems likely to continue as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,\" he said.\n\nThe report compared two five-year periods and noted that Russian arms supplies to India are declining.\n\nIt said the United States' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent, while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Wezeman.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,\" he added.\n\nThe report said three of the top 10 importers during 2018-22 were in the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer during 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period, it said.\n\nQatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third-biggest arms importer during 2018-22, it added.",

With an 11% share of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-22, a position it has held for the period 1993-2022. It retained this position even though its arms imports dropped by 11% between 2013-17 and 2018-22.\"\n\n\"The decrease can be attributed to several factors including India's slow and complex arms procurement process, efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms that are designed and produced domestically,\" the SIPRI report stated.\n\nThe last report had showed a 21% dip in defence imports. \"Between 2012-16 and 2017-21, Indian arms imports decreased by 21%. Despite this, India was the world's largest importer of major arms in 2017-21 and accounted for 11% of total global arms imports in the period,\" the report released last year had said.\n\nThe report said that Russia was the largest supplier of arms to India in both 2013-17 and 2018-22, but its share of total Indian arms imports fell drastically. The report found that from 2013-17 and 2018-22, Russia's supplies reduced from 64% to 45%. \"Russia's position as India's main arms supplier is under pressure due to strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production and, since 2022, the above-mentioned constraints on Russia's arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine,\" it stated.\n\nOn the other side, India has seen a massive increase of supplies from France. \"India's arms imports from France, which included 62 combat aircraft and 4 submarines, increased by 489% between 2013-17 and 2018-22. France therefore displaced the USA to become the second largest supplier to India in 2018-22,\" the report released on Monday stated.\n\nDuring Aero India, when Russia is in war, it came with largest ever contingent along with F-35 which had turned heads.\n\nThe report spoke about the import of Pakistan as well. According to the report, arms imports by Pakistan increased by 14% between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and accounted for 3.7% of the global total. China supplied over three quarters (77%) of Pakistan's arms imports in 2018-22. Till 2021, as per the report released last year, China was sharing around 72% of the total imports by Pakistan from China.\n\nSIPRI is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.\n\nEstablished in 1966, SIPRI provides data, analysis and recommendations, based on open sources, to policymakers, researchers, media and the interested public.",

                    "body": "India remained the world's top arms importer, but its imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, according to a report released on Monday by Stockholm-based defence think-tank SIPRI.\n\nThe decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs, the report said.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said the five largest arms importers in the world during 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.\n\nThe five largest arms exporters were the United States, Russia, France, China and Germany.\n\nThe imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth-largest arms importer during 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier, the report said.\n\nIt said France's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and most of these exports were to countries in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East.\n\nThe report said India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports during 2018-22 and France displaced the US as the second-largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n''France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India for example,'' said Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\n''This seems likely to continue as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,'' he said.\n\nThe report compared two five-year periods and noted that Russian arms supplies to India are declining.\n\nIt said the United States' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent, while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent.\n\n''Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,'' said Wezeman.\n\n''Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,'' he added.\n\nThe report said three of the top 10 importers during 2018-22 were in the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the world's second-largest arms importer during 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period, it said.\n\nQatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third-biggest arms importer during 2018-22, it added.",

                    "body": "The data released Monday showed Russia was India's largest arms supplier in the periods between 2013-17 and 2018-22, but its share of arms imports to India fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent while France emerged as the second-largest arms supplier to India between 2018-22 at 29 per cent, followed by the US at 11 per cent.\n\nThe report said India's tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports.\n\n\"With an 11 percent share of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-22, a position it has held for the period 1993-2022,\" it said.\n\nHowever, it added that the 11 per cent drop in arms imports can be attributed to several factors including India's slow and complex arms procurement process, and efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, among others.\n\nAside from Russia and France, India also imported arms during this five-year period from Israel, South Korea, and South Africa which are among the top arms exporters globally.\n\nThe report said Russia's position as India's main arms supplier is under pressure owing to strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production, and, since 2022, constraints on Russia's arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt also said just under two-thirds of Russian arms exports went to India, China, and Egypt in 2018-22 -- at 31 per cent, 23 per cent, and 9.3 per cent, respectively. It said while Russian arms exports went down by 37 per cent between the two periods, exports to China and Egypt increased by 39 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively, within the same time frame.\n\nIt, however, said that Russia made no deliveries to Egypt in 2021-22 and the volume of deliveries to China in 2020-22 was lower than in 2018-19. \"It is likely that order volumes from these two states will reduce in the coming years,\" it stated.\n\nIndia's arms import from France, SIPRI said, included 62 combat aircraft and four submarines and increased by 489 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22.\n\n\"France therefore displaced the USA to become the second largest supplier to India in 2018-22,\" the report said.\n\nAs per the data, India was the third-largest arms supplier to Myanmar during this period after Russia and China and comprised 14 per cent of its imports. It also stated that 77 per cent of Pakistan's arms supply in 2018-22 came from China.\n\nThe report said imports of major arms by European states increased by 47 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 in the backdrop of the war in Ukraine even as the global volume of international arms transfers fell by 5.1 per cent.",

                    "body": "Weapon transfers to Europe rose sharply in 2022, while arms trade across the world declined, a Stockholm-based think tank has found\n\nThe US and EU's extensive military aid to Kiev amid its ongoing conflict with Moscow made Ukraine the third largest importer of major arms in 2022, after Qatar and India, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported on Monday.\n\nUkraine also ranked as the 14th largest weapons importer in the world for the five-year period between 2018 and 2022, accounting for some 2% of global arms imports, the think tank found.\n\nWhile the global level of international arms transfers has fallen by 5.1% in the past five years, SIPRI also reported that imports of arms by European states saw a sharp increase of 47%, while European NATO states increased their weapon imports by 65% amid a perceived threat from Russia.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" noted Pieter D. Wezeman, a senior SIPRI researcher, adding that European states now want to \"import more arms, faster.\"\n\nHe also observed that, while the US and other NATO states have declined Kiev's requests for combat aircraft and long-range missiles out of fears of an escalation in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, they have nevertheless supplied such arms to other states involved in the conflict, \"particularly in the Middle East and South Asia.\"\n\nRussia and the US have remained the biggest weapons exporters in the world, although Moscow's share of arms sales reportedly fell from 22% to 16% while Washington's share saw an increase from 33% to 40%. Also, between 2018 and 2022, US arms sales grew by 14%, while Russia's sales fell by 31%.\n\nMeanwhile, Asia and Oceania accounted for 41% of arms deliveries in 2018-2022, with countries like India, Australia, China, South Korea, Pakistan and Japan landing in the top ten of global arms importers. Wesman explained that the increased demand is being driven by a perceived growing threat from China and North Korea.\n\nAs for the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt found themselves in the top ten of weapons importers for the past five years, with the great majority of weapons being provided by the USA (54%), followed by France, Russia and Italy. The sales included over 260 advanced combat aircraft, over 500 new tanks and 13 frigates, SIPRI reported.",

                    "body": "The US and EU's extensive military aid to Kiev amid its ongoing conflict with Moscow made Ukraine the third largest importer of major arms in 2022, after Qatar and India, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported on Monday.\n\nUkraine also ranked as the 14th largest weapons importer in the world for the five-year period between 2018 and 2022, accounting for some 2% of global arms imports, the think tank found.\n\nWhile the global level of international arms transfers has fallen by 5.1% in the past five years, SIPRI also reported that imports of arms by European states saw a sharp increase of 47%, while European NATO states increased their weapon imports by 65% amid a perceived threat from Russia.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" noted Pieter D. Wezeman, a senior SIPRI researcher, adding that European states now want to \"import more arms, faster.\"\n\nHe also observed that, while the US and other NATO states have declined Kiev's requests for combat aircraft and long-range missiles out of fears of an escalation in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, they have nevertheless supplied such arms to other states involved in the conflict, \"particularly in the Middle East and South Asia.\"\n\nRussia and the US have remained the biggest weapons exporters in the world, although Moscow's share of arms sales reportedly fell from 22% to 16% while Washington's share saw an increase from 33% to 40%. Also, between 2018 and 2022, US arms sales grew by 14%, while Russia's sales fell by 31%.\n\nMeanwhile, Asia and Oceania accounted for 41% of arms deliveries in 2018-2022, with countries like India, Australia, China, South Korea, Pakistan and Japan landing in the top ten of global arms importers. Wesman explained that the increased demand is being driven by a perceived growing threat from China and North Korea.\n\nAs for the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt found themselves in the top ten of weapons importers for the past five years, with the great majority of weapons being provided by the USA (54%), followed by France, Russia and Italy. The sales included over 260 advanced combat aircraft, over 500 new tanks and 13 frigates, SIPRI reported.",

                    "body": "The overall total amount of arms imported into the Middle East decreased by 8.8% over the past five years.\n\nIn the five years leading up to 2022, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt were three of the top ten global importers of weapons and arms, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nSince 2018, Qatar increased its position from sixth to third in terms of its importation of weapons. When the data from the two time periods is compared, it is noticeable that the country's imports rose by 311%.\n\nAircrafts, air defence systems, armoured vehicles, missiles, naval weapons, sensors and ships were among the items Qatar purchased in 2022.\n\nThe US took over 42% of the sales, making them the main suppliers to the country, followed by France at 29% and then Italy at 14%.\n\nQatar purchased 36 combat aircrafts from France, 36 from the United States, 8 from the United Kingdom, as well as 3 frigates from Italy, according to SIPRI.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, Saudi Arabia was the second largest arms importer in the world.\n\nA total of 9.6% of all imports of arms during that time went to the Kingdom.\n\nThe primary suppliers to Saudi Arabia were the US with 78% of total imports, followed by France at 6% and then Spain at 4.9%.\n\nAccording to the SIPRI report, the US provided Saudi Arabia with \"the delivery of 91 combat aircraft with hundreds of land-attack missiles and over 20,000 guided bombs\".\n\nOverall imports into the Kingdom decreased by 8.7% between 2018 and 2022 compared to 2013 and 2017.\n\nEgypt fell from being ranked third over the previous five years to sixth place over the past five years, as its overall imports decreased by 5.3% when compared between the two time periods.\n\nEgypt bought aircraft, missiles, ships, naval weapons, sensors, and aircraft during the previous year.\n\nEgypt is now Russia's third-largest recipient of arms, with a 44% increase in exports between the two time periods of 2013-2017 compared to 2018-2022.\n\nIn the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Algeria, Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain, and Iraq were the top ten arm importers.\n\nThe UAE's imports of weapons between 2018 and 2022 were 38% less than they were between 2013 and 2017, which caused it to fall from the top 10 importers to the 11th position globally.\n\nSIPRI noted: \"Notable arms imports in 2018-22 included thousands of guided bombs and hundreds of air defence missiles from the US.\"\n\nThe US, with 54%, was the country that imported the most arms and weapons into the Middle East, followed by France at 12%, Russia at 8.6% and Italy at 8.4%.\n\nThese imports included more than 260 cutting-edge combat aircraft, 516 new tanks and 13 frigates, according to SIPRI data. \"Arab states in the Gulf region alone have placed orders for another more than 180 combat aircraft,\" the think tank noted.\n\nHowever, when comparing the period from 2013 - 2017 to 2018 - 2022, the total amount of arms imported into the Middle East decreased by 8.8%.\n\nThe top ten arm importers globally over the previous five years were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia, China, Egypt, South Korea, Pakistan, Japan and the United States.\n\nThe top 10 countries that exported the most weapons were the United States, Russia, France, China, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain, South Korea and Israeli Apartheid State.\n\nThe statistical information provided by SIPRI on arms transfers relates to actual major weapon deliveries.\n\nUsing a standard measurement it refers to as the trend-indicator value, it calculates the volume of significant international transfers of arms (TIV).",

                    "body": "STOCKHOLM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- European states' imports of major arms over the five years between 2018 and 2022 surged significantly compared with that of the 2013-2017 period, despite the global arms transfers decreased during the same period, a Swedish research institute said on Monday.\n\nIn its latest report of global arms sales, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said during the 2018-2022 period, the imports of major arms by European states increased by 47 percent from the five years between 2013 and 2017, while the global arms transfers decreased by 5.1 percent during the same period.\n\nDuring the stated period, arms imports in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and the Middle East fell by 40 percent, 21 percent, 7.5 percent and 8.8 percent respectively, according to the report.\n\nIn the meantime, European North Atlantic Treaty Organization states increased their arms imports by 65 percent mainly due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe report also said that the U.S. dominance of the global arms trade increased, as its share of global arms exports surged from 33 percent to 40 percent while Russia's share fell from 22 percent to 16 percent.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea, Japan and Australia's arms imports soared 61 percent, 171 percent and 23 percent respectively, with the United States as the main supplier to the three countries. In the Middle East, the largest arms supplier is also the United States, providing 54 percent of the region's arms imports.\n\nAs a result of military aid from the United States and many European states following the Ukraine crisis in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme, in a press release.\n\nHeadquartered in Stockholm, SIPRI's research covers international conflicts, armaments, arms control and disarmament. \u25a0",

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, reported that from 1991, when Ukraine became independent amid the fall of the Soviet Union, until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms. But Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 last year markedly changed that and Ukraine became the third biggest importer of major arms in 2022 after Qatar and India, SIPRI said, citing a report with new data on global arms transfers.",

Only Qatar - which has dramatically ramped up its arms purchasing in the past decade - and India imported more arms in the year, SIPRI said in its report on global arms transfers.\n\nPieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program noted that even as arms transfers declined globally last year, \"those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states.\" He said that following Russia\u00b4s invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, \"faster.\"\n\nSIPRI said that the export of arms has long been dominated by the United States and Russia with the two countries being the largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nHowever, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest arms supplier, France, has narrowed. The think tank said it was likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia\u00b4s arms exports due to Moscow\u00b4s need to prioritize supplying its own armed forces and low demand from other states due to trade sanctions.\n\nA Ukrainian paratrooper of 95 Air Assault brigade aims to fire by MSLR BM-21 \"Grad\" towards Russian positions at the frontline near Kreminna, Ukraine, Thursday, March 9, 2023.

                    "body": "The decline in imports is due to complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs, noted SIPRI.\n\nIndia remained the world's top arms and weapon systems importer, with 30 percent of it coming from France which has unseated the United States of America (USA) to become the second largest supplier to New Delhi, said a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report released on Monday.\n\nDespite leading amongst the group of arms importing nations, India's defence imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 due to \"complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs,\" the SIPRI finding on global military spending stated.\n\nIndia is followed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China, highlighted SIPRI on the basis of global data and deals.\n\nGrowing ties with Paris\n\nThe United States and France have emerged as the main beneficiaries of the Russia-Ukraine war. While Russian arms exports to India, which is one of the largest recipients of defence equipment since Soviet era, fell by 37 percent, the void created is being filled by France. SIPRI report also seconds New Delhi's growing ties with Paris, as the data clearly points out that \"India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports in 2018-22, and France displaced the USA as the second largest supplier of arms to India after Russia\".\n\nThe report observed that five arms exporting countries -- other than top three USA, Russia and France -- saw their sales falling. China's decline is 23 percent, Germany-35 percent, the United Kingdom- 35 percent, Spain-4.4 percent and Israel-15 percent.\n\nThe two nations who bucked the trend with impressive increase in export are South Korea with 74 percent and Italy with 45 percent.\n\nRise in European transfers\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster, it emphasised.\n\nOverall, US arms exports increased by 14 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. And the USA accounted for 40 per cent of global arms exports in 2018-22. While Russia's arms exports fell by 31 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22 per cent to 16 per cent, while France's share increased from 7.1 per cent to 11 per cent, the SIPRI observed. The Putin administration, however, has been able to sell arms 39 percent more to China and 44 percent to Egypt, and they became Russia's second and third largest recipients.\n\nThe other hand, imports by Pakistan have gone by 14 per cent, with China being its main supplier, the SIPRI findings stated.\n\nAccording to the report, the arms race is visible in Asia and Oceania as a whole, which received 41 per cent of major arms transfers in 2018-22, though a slightly smaller share than in 2013-17. Six states -- India, Australia, China, South Korea, Pakistan and Japan -- in the region were among the 10 largest importers globally in 2018-22, it stated. \"Growing perceptions of threats from China and North Korea have driven rising demand for arms imports by Japan, South Korea and Australia, notably including for long-range strike weapons,\" said Siemon T. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The main supplier for all three is the USA.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on March 13, 2023",

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, reported that from 1991, when Ukraine became independent amid the fall of the Soviet Union, until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms.\n\nBut Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 last year markedly changed that. Only Qatar -- which has dramatically ramped up its arms purchasing in the past decade -- and India imported more arms in the year, SIPRI said in its report on global arms transfers.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by The Associated Press A Ukrainian paratrooper of 95 Air Assault brigade speaks to his commander after firing by MSLR BM-21 \"Grad\" towards Russian positions at the frontline near Kreminna, Ukraine, Thursday, March 9, 2023. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)\n\nPieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program noted that even as arms transfers declined globally last year, \"those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states.\" He said that following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, \"faster.\"\n\nLoad Error\n\nSIPRI said that the export of arms has long been dominated by the United States and Russia with the two countries being the largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nHowever, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest arms supplier, France, has narrowed. The think tank said it was likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports due to Moscow's need to prioritize supplying its own armed forces and low demand from other states due to trade sanctions.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by The Associated Press A Ukrainian serviceman in a tank prepares to shoot while his comrade passes by in an armored vehicle near Bakhmut, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 8, 2023. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)\n\nSIPRI's data showed that U.S. arms exports increased by 14% between the periods 2013-17 and 2018-22, and Washington accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018-22.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's arms exports fell by 31% between the two periods, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22% to 16%, while France's share increased from 7.1% to 11%.\n\nSIPRI, established in 1966, is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "title": "Imports of Arms by European States Increase - Indian Flash News",
                    "body": "Imports of arms by European states increased by 47 per cent in almost ten years, while the global level of international arms transfers decreased by 5.1 per cent, according to a new data on global arms transfers by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAs per the data, arms imports fell overall in Africa (-40 per cent), the Americas (-21 per cent), Asia and Oceania (-7.5 per cent) and the Middle East (-8.8 per cent) between between 2013-17 and 2018-22. However, imports to East Asia and certain states in other areas of high geopolitical tension rose sharply.\n\nThe United States' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent, according to SIPRI.\n\n'Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level.'\n\nThe USA and Russia (largest and second largest arms exporters for the past three decades) dominate global arms exports. However, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest supplier, France, has narrowed. US arms exports increased by 14 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, and the USA accounted for 40 per cent of global arms exports in 2018-22. Russia's arms exports fell by 31 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22 per cent to 16 per cent, while France's share increased from 7.1 per cent to 11 per cent, SIPRI data said.\n\nRussian arms exports decreased to 8 of its 10 biggest recipients between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Exports to India, the largest recipient of Russian arms, fell by 37 per cent, while exports to the other 7 decreased by an average of 59 per cent. However, Russian arms exports increased to China (+39 per cent) and Egypt (+44 per cent), and they became Russia's second and third largest recipients.\n\n'It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports. This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the USA and its allies not to buy Russian arms,' said Siemon T. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nFrance's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Most of these exports were to states in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East. India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports in 2018-22, and France displaced the USA as the second largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n'France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'This seems likely to continue, as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia.'\n\nFrom 1991 until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms. As a result of military aid from the USA and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) and the 14th biggest for 2018-22. Ukraine accounted for 2.0 per cent of global arms imports in the five-year period, SIPRI said in a release.\n\n'Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nAsia and Oceania received 41 per cent of major arms transfers in 2018-22, a slightly smaller share than in 2013-17. Despite the overall decline in transfers to the region, there were marked increases in some states, and marked decreases in others. Six states in the region were among the 10 largest importers globally in 2018-22: India, Australia, China, South Korea, Pakistan and Japan.\n\nArms imports by East Asian states increased by 21 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Arms imports by China rose by 4.1 per cent, with most coming from Russia. However, the biggest increases in East Asia were by US treaty allies South Korea (+61 per cent) and Japan (+171 per cent). Australia, the largest arms importer in Oceania, increased its imports by 23 per cent.\n\n'Growing perceptions of threats from China and North Korea have driven rising demand for arms imports by Japan, South Korea and Australia, notably including for long-range strike weapons,' said Siemon T. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'The main supplier for all three is the USA.'\n\nIndia remains the world's top arm importer, but the imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. This decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arm suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs. Imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth largest arm importer in 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier.\n\nThree of the top 10 importers in 2018-22 were in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt. Saudi Arabia was the world's second largest arm importer in 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period. Qatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third biggest arms importer in 2018-22.\n\nThe great majority of arms imports to the Middle East came from the USA (54 per cent), followed by France (12 per cent), Russia (8.6 per cent) and Italy (8.4 per cent). They included more than 260 advanced combat aircraft, 516 new tanks and 13 frigates. Arab states in the Gulf region alone have placed orders for another more than 180 combat aircraft, while 24 have been ordered from Russia by Iran (which received virtually no major arms during 2018-22).",

                    "body": "But Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 last year markedly changed that. Only Qatar -- which has dramatically ramped up its arms purchasing in the past decade -- and India imported more arms in the year, SIPRI said in its report on global arms transfers.\n\nPieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program noted that even as arms transfers declined globally last year, \"those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states.\" He said that following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, \"faster.\"\n\nSIPRI said that the export of arms has long been dominated by the United States and Russia with the two countries being the largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nHowever, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest arms supplier, France, has narrowed. The think tank said it was likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports due to Moscow's need to prioritize supplying its own armed forces and low demand from other states due to trade sanctions.\n\nSIPRI's data showed that U.S. arms exports increased by 14% between the periods 2013-17 and 2018-22, and Washington accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018-22.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's arms exports fell by 31% between the two periods, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22% to 16%, while France's share increased from 7.1% to 11%.\n\nSIPRI, established in 1966, is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

The think tank said it was likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports due to Moscow's need to prioritize supplying its own armed forces and low demand from other states due to trade sanctions.\n\nSIPRI's data showed that U.S. arms exports increased by 14% between the periods 2013-17 and 2018-22, and Washington accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018-22.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's arms exports fell by 31% between the two periods, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22% to 16%, while France's share increased from 7.1% to 11%.\n\nSIPRI, established in 1966, is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

                    "body": "2 Kurdish journalists indicted for covering funeral of colleague killed in Iraq\n\nThe latest report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) shows that Turkey's share of global arms exports, which was 0.6 percent between 2013 and 2017, increased to 1.1 percent in the following four-year period, Deutsche Welle Turkish service reported on Monday.\n\nAccording to the report Turkey's arms exports surged by 69 percent from 2013-17 to 2018-22, while its share of global arms exports increased by 0.5 percent in the same period, making it the 12th largest exporter in the world.\n\nQatar accounted for 20 percent of Turkey's arms exports, followed by the UAE and Oman, at 17 percent and 13 percent, respectively.\n\nTurkey was 19th among the world's largest arms importers, with its arms imports decreasing by 49 percent from 2013-17 to 2018-22. While Turkey's share of global arms imports was 2.4 percent between 2013 and 2017, it declined to 1.3 percent in the following four-year period.\n\nThe report further showed that US arms exports to its NATO ally Turkey were at a low level in the 2018-22 period as a result of increasingly strained bilateral relations. Turkey was the 27th largest recipient of US arms in 2018-22, down from the seventh largest in 2013-17.\n\nAccording to SIPRI, the world's five largest arms exporters are the US, Russia, France, China and Germany. While the ranking hasn't changed since the last report, the US has increased exports by another 14 percent, now accounting for 40 percent of global arms transfers, and France has recorded a surge of 44 percent.\n\nRussia's arms exports, however, diminished from 22 to 16 percent from 2013-17 to 2018-22, since many weapons that might otherwise have been exported are needed in its ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nAmong the most important trends in the latest report, SIPRI researcher Pieter Wezeman told DW, are that \"arms transfers to European states have significantly increased.\"\n\nThe report shows that in the most recent period, 2018-22, the international arms trade declined by just over 5 percent compared to 2013-17. By contrast, arms imports by European countries -- the vast majority of which came from the US -- increased by 47 percent and those by European NATO countries by as much as 65 percent. The reason behind that is, unsurprisingly, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, DW said.\n\nUkraine, which wasn't a major player in the international arms trade in the past, ranks 14th on the list of worldwide weapons importers. Considering 2022 alone, Ukraine comes in third, according to the report.\n\nSIPRI usually refers to \"arms transfers\" in its report, meaning both the arms trade and free military assistance, the latter of which is Ukraine's main supply of weapons. This kind of military aid usually consists of older equipment or surplus stock from donor nations.",

                    "body": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has led to a substantial flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe made Ukraine the world's third largest importer of arms in 2022, a Swedish think tank said Monday.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, reported that from 1991, when Ukraine became independent amid the fall of the Soviet Union, until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms.\n\nBut Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 last year markedly changed that. Only Qatar -- which has dramatically ramped up its arms purchasing in the past decade -- and India imported more arms in the year, SIPRI said in its report on global arms transfers.\n\nPieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program noted that even as arms transfers declined globally last year, \"those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states.\" He said that following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, \"faster.\"\n\nSIPRI said that the export of arms has long been dominated by the United States and Russia with the two countries being the largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nHowever, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest arms supplier, France, has narrowed. The think tank said it was likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports due to Moscow's need to prioritize supplying its own armed forces and low demand from other states due to trade sanctions.\n\nSIPRI's data showed that U.S. arms exports increased by 14% between the periods 2013-17 and 2018-22, and Washington accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018-22.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's arms exports fell by 31% between the two periods, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22% to 16%, while France's share increased from 7.1% to 11%.\n\nSIPRI, established in 1966, is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",

According to SIPRI, international arms transfers fell 5.1 per cent globally.\n\nFor the past three decades, the United States and Russia have been the world's largest and second-largest arms exporters, respectively.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2017, the United States increased its arms exports by 14 per cent, accounting for 40 per cent of global arms exports. Russia's share fell from 22 per cent to 16 per cent.\n\n\"It is likely that Russia's arms exports will be further restricted as a result of the invasion of Ukraine and this is because Russia will prioritise supplying its armed forces, while demand from other countries will remain low due to Russia's trade sanctions,\" said SIPRI's Siemon T Wezeman.\n\nSIPRI issued a warning in 2022 that the global nuclear arsenal was likely to grow in the coming years.",

Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the Sipri Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nWezeman said it was because Russia would prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states would remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the US and its allies not to buy Russian arms.\n\nOn the other hand, France's arms exports increased by 44 percent between 2013-17 and 2018-22.\n\nMost of these exports were to countries in Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East.\n\nIndia received 30 percent of France's arms exports in 2018-22, and France displaced the US as the second largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example,\" said Wezeman.\n\n\"This seems likely to continue, as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia.\" EFE",

This will not create more security in Europe,\" explains Sevim Dagdelen, Chairwoman of the DIE LINKE parliamentary group in the Foreign Affairs Committee and spokeswoman for international politics and disarmament, on the latest report by the Stockholm peace research institute SIPRI. Dagdelen continued: \"The new SIPRI numbers must be a wake-up call to stop the rearmament madness from which only the armaments companies benefit, with companies in the USA at the top, which are the biggest beneficiaries with a share of 40 percent and a clear distance to the rest of arms exports. The fact that Germany is the fifth largest supplier of arms after Russia (16 percent), France (11 percent) and China (5.2 percent) with 4.2 percent shows that the talk of restrictive licensing practices for arms exports is nothing but a deception of the public A consistent halt to arms deliveries is necessary, especially in crisis and war zones. It is a mockery that the traffic light government, in breach of the coalition agreement, does not even refuse export licenses for arms deliveries to states that are demonstrably directly involved in the Yemen war, above all the head-to-head dictatorship of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nMIL OSI\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

                    "title": "SIPRI: Turkey Arms Exports Grew by 69 per cent in 2018-2022",
                    "body": "A new report, \"Trends in International Arms Transfers 2022\", published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, says Turkey's arms exports increased by 69 per cent from 2018 to 2022 comparing to 2013-2017.\n\nTurkey's global share of the trade also increased in the period 2018-2022, by 0.5 per cent. Turkey's arms exports comprise 1.1 per cent of all global arms exports.\n\nAccording to the SIPRI report, its top three customers are Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman. The three Middle Eastern countries' imports from Turkey make up half of its total arms sales.\n\nSIPRI noted that Turkey's arms trade changed dramatically in the last five years, reflecting its shifting and often ambivalent foreign policy priorities.\n\n\"The US's arms exports to its NATO ally Turkey were at a low level in 2018-22 as a result of increasingly strained bilateral relations. Turkey was the 27th largest recipient of US arms in 2018-22, down from 7th largest in 2013-17,\" the SIPRI report wrote.\n\nTurkey's defence industry has improved in the last decade, with the country producing its own armed drones, tanks, helicopters, missiles and immunation.\n\nAccording to the Turkish Defence Ministry, the defence industry now supplies 80 per cent of its military's equipment and weaponry. The figure was only 20 per cent in 2004.\n\nTurkey's arms export, especially armed drones, made headlines since they changed the fate of several wars, including Libya's local war, the Azerbaijani-Armenian war and the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nSIPRI also noted that Turkey has strengthened its navy due to growing tensions with Greece in the East Med and Aegean Sea.\n\n\"Turkey is able to produce most types of warships but has six submarines on order from Germany for delivery in 2023-27 and an amphibious assault ship on order from Spain for delivery in 2023,\" the report underlined.\n\nSIPRI provides data, analysis and recommendations on armed conflicts, military expenditure and the arms trade as well as disarmament and arms control in addition to its regular reports.\n\nIn its 2022 report, SIPRI noted that the European countries had increased their armaments due to the war in Ukraine and increasing trade with Russia. Ukraine was the world's third largest arms importer in 2022.\n\n\"Imports of major arms by European states increased by 47 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, while the global level of international arms transfers decreased by 5.1 per cent,\" the report wrote.",

                    "title": "India emerges as top importer of arms: SIPRI",
                    "body": "India has once again emerged as the largest importer of weapons and it accounts for almost 11 per cent of all such international imports of different military equipment.\n\nAccording to a report released by the Sweden-based think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday morning, countries including Qatar, Australia, China and Saudi Arabia hold the fourth position as global importers of weapons.\n\nThe third position is held by Russia (16 per cent), France (11 per cent), and the US (40 per cent) of global share. The assessment report which is released by the SIPRI is made for a five year period (2018-2022) and is titled 'Trends in International Arms Transfer -2022'.\n\nThe report has compared the trend based on five year blocks - 2013-2017 and 2018-2022 and has indicated that there has been a decline in Indian arms imports in global share. \"Despite this, India was the world's largest importer of major arms in 2018-22 and accounted for 11 per cent of total global arms imports in the period,\" the report said.\n\nAs per the report, while Russia continues to be the largest supplier of arms to India and supplied 45 per cent of all Indian imports, from France India has imported 29 per cent and from the US 11 per cent of equipment. Other countries from where India has imported include South Korea, Israel and South Africa.\n\nThe report has also compared two five-year periods of Russia's share in the Indian market and it has stated that in the period between 2013-2017 Russia was the largest supplier of arms in that period to India. However in the period of 2018-2022 the imports fell from 64 per cent to 45 per cent.\n\nIn 2022 Ukraine is now world's third largest arms importer\n\nAccording to Pieter D Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme, ''Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia.''\n\nFollowing the Russia-Ukraine war many European nations as well as the US have sent in military aid to Ukraine making it the third largest country in the world to import arms in 2022 after India and Qatar. And in the five year bracket of 2018-2022 it holds the 14 position, this means that Ukraine has accounted for 2.0 per cent of global arms imports in the five year period. Between 1991-2021 Ukraine imported a few major arms.\n\nRussia-India\n\nThe SIPRI report states that Russia continues to hold the top position as a main arms' supplier to India and is now facing competition from other countries which too are supplying to India. Also, India has been focussing on self reliance in the defence sector and has been pushing local production of critical platforms through Transfer of Technology. Following the Russia-Ukraine war there have been constraints on Russia's export of arms.\n\nIndia-Pakistan-China\n\nThe growing tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as well as Line of Control (LoC) has driven India's demand for arms.\n\nAbout Pakistan\n\nPakistan's arms imports have increased by almost 14 percent between the period 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, this means it has accounted for 3.7 per cent of the global total.\n\nBetween 2018-22 China has supplied over three quarters (77 per cent) of Pakistan's arms imports.",

The South Asian nation has supported calls for a ceasefire and a diplomatic solution to end Russia's war, but has abstained at the United Nations on votes condemning Russia's invasion. It has also continued its purchases of cheap Russian oil.\n\nAlso read | Boosting self-reliance biggest lesson for India from war in Ukraine: CDS\n\nIndia has been the world's largest arms importer since 1993 and \"tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports,\" the report added.\n\nSanctions on Russia, affecting weapons exports, increased defense equipment manufacturing in India, and increased competition from countries like France -- that has seen its arms exports to New Delhi jump a whopping 489% over the same period -- leading to the drop in purchases from Moscow, the SIPRI report added.\n\nParis has edged out the US to become the second-largest weapons supplier to India in 2018-22.",

                    "body": "UPDATES WITH MORE DETAILS FROM SIPRI REPORT\n\nBy Tuba Sahin\n\nANKARA (AA) \u00e2\u20ac\" The volume of the international arms trade in 2018-2022 contracted by 5.1% from the previous five-year period, according to a report released on Monday.\n\nThe five largest weapons exporters were the US, Russia, France, China, and Germany, with a share of 76% of global exports from 2018 to 2022, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said in its report.\n\nAccounting for 40% of the global total in that period, US arms exports surged 14% from 2013-2017.\n\nA total of 41% of US arms exports went to the Middle East, down from 49% from the previous period.\n\nRussia's arms exports, meanwhile, plunged 31% in 2018-2022 compared to the previous half-decade.\n\nIndia, with a 31% share, was the biggest recipient of Russian weapons, followed by China with 23% and Egypt with 9.3%.\n\nRussian exports to India fell 37% between the two five-year periods, while they surged 39% to China and 44% to Egypt.\n\n\"However, Russia made no deliveries to Egypt in 2021-2022 and the volume of deliveries to China in 2020-2022 was at a much lower level than in 2018-2019,\" it said.\n\nThe report projected a further decline in Russia's arms exports due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, now in its second year, as the country will likely to prioritize the production of arms for its own military.\n\n\"The multilateral sanctions, including wide-ranging trade restrictions, imposed on Russia, coupled with pressure from the USA and its allies on states not to acquire Russian arms, will also hamper its efforts to export arms,\" it added.\n\nFrench arms exports soared by 44% during this period, with nearly a third of this increase going to India. The country also expanded its share in global weapons exports to 11% from the previous five years' 7.1%.\n\nExports from China, meanwhile, diminished by 23% and from German by 35%.\n\nArms imports\n\nIndia continued to the world's top arms importer in 2018-2022, mainly due to tensions with its northern neighbors Pakistan and China.\n\nIndia's share in global weapons imports over the past five years slipped to 11%, down from 12% in 2013-2017, hampered by its slow and complex arms procurement process, along with its efforts to diversify suppliers and attempts to replace imports with domestic design and production.\n\nDespite the decline in Russian exports, it maintained is position as India's largest supplier, though its share in total imports by New Delhi fell from 64% to 45% between the two five-year periods.\n\nAfter India, Saudi Arabia (9.6%), Qatar (6.4%), Australia (4.7%), and China (4.6%) had the biggest shares in global arms imports.\n\nEuropean nations, meanwhile, ramped up their purchases of foreign weapons by 47% in 2018-2022, with those of NATO members on the continent soaring 65%.\n\nThe biggest European arms importer in that period was the UK, which was also the 13th-largest importer in the world, followed by Ukraine and Norway.\n\nThe US provided 56% of Europe's arms imports, while Russia supplied 5.8%, mainly to Belarus. Germany, meanwhile, sold 5.1% of its fellow European countries' total arms imports.\n\nUkraine was the third-largest arms importer last year, as the US and many European nations sent large quantities of military aid to the country amid its war with Russia.\n\nMany of the arms supplied in 2022 were second-hand items from existing stocks, including 228 artillery pieces and an estimated 5,000 guided artillery rockets from the US, 280 tanks from Poland, and over 7,000 anti-tank missiles from the UK, said SIPRI.\n\nOutside of Europe, arms imports plunged by 40% in Africa, while they fell by a total of 21% in the Americas, by 8.8% in the Middle East, and 7.5% across Asia, while there was an increase in East Asia amid geopolitical tensions with China and North Korea, the report noted.\n\nIn that region, the largest rate of increase, 171%, was registered by Japan, followed by South Korea with 61%. The main supplier to these countries was the US.\n\nTimo Kirez contributed to this report from Geneva. -",

                    "body": "The war in Ukraine has triggered the purchase of weapons in Europe, which in a single year has doubled the import of weapons to later provide them to the Kyiv government, which has become the third world destination, according to the annual report of the International Institute for Peace Research in Stockholm (Sipri).\n\nThe war in Ukraine has triggered the purchase of weapons in Europe, which in a single year has doubled the import of weapons to later provide them to the Kyiv government, which has become the third world destination, according to the annual report of the International Institute for Peace Research in Stockholm (Sipri).\n\nWith an increase of 93% in one year, imports have also increased due to the increase in military spending by several European states such as Poland and Norway, which according to the study will accelerate further. In the five-year period between 2018 and 2022, the period used by the organization to analyze world trends, Europe has increased its purchase of weapons by 47%, an investment that has skyrocketed in the last year due to the Russian invasion.\n\n\"The invasion has caused a significant increase in the demand for arms in Europe, which has not yet shown its full potential and will in all probability lead to further increases in imports,\" Pieter Wezeman, co-author of the prestigious report, told AFP. which has been published for three decades.\n\nFrom one year to the next, Ukraine has gone from being a negligible arms importer to becoming the third largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as a direct result of Western help to defend against Russian invasion.\n\nThe country alone accounts for 31% of arms imports in Europe and 8% of world trade, according to Sipri.\n\nOn the other hand, the United States has strengthened its dominance in the world arms trade in the last five years. The sale of US arms grew by 14% in 2018-22 compared to 2013-17 and its share in world exports went from 33 to 40% in that period, while the distance with respect to the second largest exporter has widened, Russia.\n\nIf in 2013-2017 US exports, which sold arms to 103 countries and had the Middle East as its main recipient, were 50% greater than Russian exports, in the following five years that distance multiplied to 148%.\n\nRussian exports fell by 31% in that period and its world share fell from 22 to 16%. \"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit arms exports from Russia, as Russia will prioritize supplies to its military and demand from other countries will remain low due to sanctions and increasing pressure from the US and its allies\", notes SIPRI.\n\nThe report also points to the tensions between a large part of the European countries and Russia to explain why Europe is the only region where arms imports have grown in the last five years, within a global fall of 5.1%.\n\nAccording to SIPRI data, Spain was the sixth world exporter, with a global share of 2.6%, one tenth more than the previous five years, and despite suffering a 4.4% drop in sales, with Australia , Saudi Arabia and Belgium as the main buyers.\n\nIndia remains the main world importer, with a share of 11%, despite a reduction of 11% in its purchases; followed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.\n\nSIPRI also highlights that the European member countries of NATO increased their imports by 65% in the last five years in response to tensions with Russia.",

                    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Russia remains India's main source of weapons even as the nation has drastically trimmed purchases, highlighting the challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of recalibrating New Delhi's dependence on Moscow, while its borders with both China and Pakistan remain tense.\n\nRussian weapon imports dropped by 19% for the five year period starting 2018 compared to a similar time frame earlier, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent think tank which studies conflict, weapon sales and disarmament.\n\n\"Russia was the largest supplier of arms to India in both 2013-17 and 2018-22, but its share of total Indian arms imports fell from 64% to 45%,\" according to the latest report released on Monday.\n\nIndia's dependence on Moscow for weapons is one of the factors behind New Delhi's neutral stance on Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, despite pressure from countries such as the US, Japan and Australia. The South Asian nation has supported calls for a ceasefire and a diplomatic solution to end Russia's war, but has abstained at the United Nations on votes condemning Russia's invasion. It has also continued its purchases of cheap Russian oil.\n\nIndia has been the world's largest arms importer since 1993 and \"tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports,\" the report added.\n\nSanctions on Russia, affecting weapons exports, increased defense equipment manufacturing in India, and increased competition from countries like France -- that has seen its arms exports to New Delhi jump a whopping 489% over the same period -- leading to the drop in purchases from Moscow, the SIPRI report added.\n\nParis has edged out the US to become the second-largest weapons supplier to India in 2018-22.",

The South Asian nation has supported calls for a ceasefire and a diplomatic solution to end Russia's war, but has abstained at the United Nations on votes condemning Russia's invasion. It has also continued its purchases of cheap Russian oil.\n\nIndia has been the world's largest arms importer since 1993 and \"tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports,\" the report added.\n\nSanctions on Russia, affecting weapons exports, increased defense equipment manufacturing in India, and increased competition from countries like France -- that has seen its arms exports to New Delhi jump a whopping 489% over the same period -- leading to the drop in purchases from Moscow, the SIPRI report added.\n\nParis has edged out the US to become the second-largest weapons supplier to India in 2018-22.",

This kind of military aid usually consists of older equipment or surplus stock from donor nations.\n\nThe report shows how, because of this, what has been delivered to Ukraine pales in a value comparison to sales of new weapons. For example, despite massive US arms deliveries to Ukraine in 2022, Washington still sent goods worth greater value to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Japan. Those four countries bought particularly new and sophisticated equipment such as fighter jets, something Ukraine has been urgently requesting from Western allies.",

                    "title": "Arms imports to Europe have risen sharply, new report finds",
                    "body": "Although the international arms market has experienced a decline over the last decade, arms imports into Europe have risen sharply, largely \"due to tensions between Russia and most European countries\".\n\nThat's according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which shows a 47% increase in arms imports in Europe when comparing the period 2013-2017 with 2018-2022, despite the overall market falling by 5.1%.\n\nThe increase in demand for weapons on European territory is particularly noticeable since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFor three decades, Russia has clearly been the second-largest arms exporter behind the United States. Moscow retains its position but has seen its share of the global market fall to 16% and is now closely followed by France with an 11% share.\n\nAccording to Siemon T. Wezeman, a senior research fellow at SIPRI's Arms Transfer Programme, \"The invasion of Ukraine is likely to further limit Russia's arms exports\", which \"will prioritise supplying its armed forces, while orders from other states will remain reduced due to sanctions\" against the Kremlin.\n\nFor Paris, meanwhile, the market is going from strength to strength: comparing the five years from 2013 to 2017 to 2018-22, France has seen a 44% increase in exports. Most recipients are states in Asia - with India accounting for 30% of French arms exports -, Oceania and the Middle East.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 completely reversed the country's need for arms. From 1991 to the end of 2021, Kyiv practically did not import heavy weapons. Since the beginning of the war, however, it has become the third-largest importer worldwide - after Qatar and India. A result, in particular, of the military aid provided by the United States and many European countries.\n\nWhile the European members of NATO offered assistance to Kyiv, many also reinforced their own arsenals in response to a growing perceived threat from neighbouring Russia.\n\nArms imports by NATO countries recorded a 65% increase in the period between 2018-2022 compared to 2013-2017. Most of these weapons come from the United States.\n\nIn the Middle East, the focus seems to be on renewing arsenals. Between 2018 and 2022, Saudi Arabia and Qatar were respectively the second and third-largest arms importers in the world. For Qatar, imports increased by 311% over the previous five years.\n\nThe vast majority of weapons destined for the region come from the United States (54%), followed by France (12%), Russia (8.6%) and Italy (8.4%).\n\nAmong the most sought-after weaponry are 260 modern fighter jets, 516 new tanks and 13 state-of-the-art frigates.",

                    "body": "Arms imports into Europe almost doubled in 2022, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said Monday.\n\nWith a 93 percent jump compared to the year before, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nExcluding Ukraine, European imports have nevertheless already risen 35 percent in 2022, according to SIPRI data.\n\nUkraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 percent of arms transfers to Europe and eight percent of world deliveries overall, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.\n\n'Whole spectrum'\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to put a dollar-value as many contracts are opaque, the global arms trade totals above $100 billion a year, and SIPRI said last year that total military expenditures had exceeded $2 trillion for the first time.\n\nEstimated military expenditures for 2022 by SIPRI will be released in April.\n\nThe surge in imports to Ukraine accelerated an already rising trend, as European states had already begun re-arming in the light of rising tension with Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nEuropean states have either \"already ordered or are planning to\" weapons ranging from \"submarines to combat aircraft, from drones to anti-tank missiles, from rifles to radars\", Wezeman said.\n\n\"Everything is being looked at, because the idea is to strengthen military capacity through the whole spectrum of available military technology.\"\n\nThe EU, which is currently fine-tuning a plan to supply Ukraine with millions of shells, is also working to increase production locally in Europe.\n\nEU Commissioner Thierry Breton, announced on French radio on Monday a project involving 15 producers in 11 member states.\n\nSIPRI prefers analysing trends over half-decades as a few contracts can tilt yearly figures.\n\nOver the last five years (2018-2022), European imports have increased by 47 percent compared to the previous five years, while world transfers have declined by five percent, it said.\n\n- Imports dropping elsewhere -\n\nUnlike Europe, all other continents have seen a decline in imports over the last five years.\n\nThere was a marked drop in Africa (-40 percent) and in North and South America (-20 percent), and declines as well in Asia (-7 percent) and the Middle East (-9 percent).\n\nIn another major shift, the Middle East became the leading destination for arms exports over the past year, accounting for 32 percent of the world total.\n\nIt jumped ahead of Asia-Oceania, which was in first place for years but fell to second in 2022, with 30 percent of the total and with Europe closing in with 27 percent.\n\nChina is continuing to spend heavily on its military but is increasingly producing its weapons locally, having previously imported heavily from Russia, which leads to reduced exports to Asia, SIPRI said.\n\nThe main destinations for arms transfers were Qatar (10 percent of the world total), India (9 percent) and Ukraine (8 percent), followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (7 percent each) and Pakistan (5 percent).\n\nThe world's top five exporters over the past five years remained the United States (40 percent); Russia (16 percent); France (11 percent); China (5 percent); and Germany (4 percent).\n\nBut while the US has seen a lift in exports, \"Russian arms exports are clearly declining,\" Wezeman said, while noting that there were discussions on China becoming a supplier to Russia.",

As a result of military aid from the USA and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) and the 14th biggest for 2018-22,\" the press release reads.\n\nSIPRI said Ukraine accounted for 2% of global arms imports in the five-year period.\n\n\"Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program.",

                    "body": "Ukraine turned into one of the largest arms importers in the world in 2022, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe Russian all-out war increased Ukraine's arms imports dramatically and limited Russia's arms exports at the same time, SIPRI reported.\n\nFrom 1991 until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported a few major arms. As a result of military aid from the USA and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the third largest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) and the 14th biggest importer for 2018-2022. Ukraine accounted for two percent of global arms imports in the five-year period, according to the data provided by SIPRI.\n\n\"Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in the conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,\" Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme said.\n\nOn the other hand, it is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports, according to SIPRI.",

Germany, meanwhile, sold 5.1% of its fellow European countries' total arms imports.\n\nUkraine was the third-largest arms importer last year, as the US and many European nations sent large quantities of military aid to the country amid its war with Russia.\n\nMany of the arms supplied in 2022 were second-hand items from existing stocks, including 228 artillery pieces and an estimated 5,000 guided artillery rockets from the US, 280 tanks from Poland, and over 7,000 anti-tank missiles from the UK, said SIPRI.",

                    "body": "India remained the world's largest arms importer for the five-year period between 2018-22 even though its arms imports dropped by 11% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, according to the Swedish Think Tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Russia was the largest supplier of arms to India in both 2013-17 and 2018-22, but its share of total Indian arms imports fell from 64% to 45% while France emerged as the second largest supplier between 2018-22.\n\nAs per latest SIPRI data, among the top 10 arms exporters for the period 2018-22, India was the biggest arms export market to three countries -- Russia, France and Israel and the second largest export market to South Korea. India was also the third largest market for South Africa which was ranked 21 in the list of arms exporters.\n\nALSO READ India eyeing $5 billion exports, $22 billion turnover in defence sector by 2025: Rajnath Singh\n\nFor the same period, India remained the largest arms importer followed by Saudi Arabia. Russia accounted for 45% is India's imports followed by France (29%) and the US (11%). At the same time, India was the third largest arms supplier to Myanmar after Russia and China accounting for 14% of its imports.\n\n\"India's tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports. With an 11% share of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-22, a position it has held for the period 1993-2022. It retained this position even though its arms imports dropped by 11% between 2013-17 and 2018-22,\" according to new data on global arms transfers published by SIPRI on Monday. \"The decrease can be attributed to several factors including India's slow and complex arms procurement process, efforts to diversify its arms suppliers, and attempts to replace imports with major arms that are designed and produced domestically.\"\n\nAlso read : Data | India reduced arms imports from Russia, while China's dependency increased\n\nThe report noted that Russia's position as India's main arms supplier is under pressure due to strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production and, since 2022, the above-mentioned constraints on Russia's arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"India's arms imports from France, which included 62 combat aircraft and four submarines, increased by 489% between 2013-17 and 2018-22. France therefore displaced the USA to become the second largest supplier to India in 2018-22,\" the report said.\n\nALSO READ Moving fast from being biggest defence importer to big exporter: Modi\n\nJust under two thirds of Russian arms exports went to three states in 2018-22 -- India (31%), China (23%) and Egypt (9.3%). India was also the largest recipient of Russian arms in 2013-17, but exports to India decreased by 37% between the two periods. In contrast, exports to China (+39%) and Egypt (+44%) increased within the same time frame, the report said while noting that Russia made no deliveries to Egypt in 2021-22 and the volume of deliveries to China in 2020-22 was at a much lower level than in 2018-19. \"It is likely that order volumes from these two states will reduce in the coming years,\" it stated.\n\nFor the same period, arms imports by Pakistan increased by 14% between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and accounted for 3.7% of the global total with China supplying 77% of Pakistan's arms imports in 2018-22.\n\nWhile the global level of international arms transfers decreased by 5.1%, imports of major arms by European states increased by 47% between 2013-17 and 2018-22 in the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. \"'Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI arms transfers programme.\n\nOverall, the U.S. share of global arms exports increased from 33% to 40% while Russia's fell from 22% to 16%.",

                    "body": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, following years of growing tensions, has prompted European countries to rush to bolster their defences.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), said in a statement.\n\nSIPRI defines major arms as aircraft, warships, tanks, artillery, missiles and various heavy defence systems.\n\nEuropean states in the U.S.-led NATO alliance increased their arms imports by 65% from the previous five-year period. But worldwide, international arms transfers fell 5.1%, according to SIPRI.\n\nThe United States and Russia have been the world's largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nU.S. arms exports increased by 14% from 2013-17, and the U.S. accounted for 40% of global arms exports. Russia's share fell to 16% from 22%.\n\n\"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports,\" SIPRI's Siemon T. Wezeman said. \"This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nIn 2022, SIPRI warned that the global nuclear arsenal was likely to grow in the coming years.",

At the same time, they have supplied such weapons to other states involved in conflicts, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,\" explained Peter D. Wezeman, senior researcher at SIPRI's Arms Transfer Program.",

                    "body": "Paris: In a report, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), on Monday, revealed France is on the verge of taking over Russia as the second-largest exporter of weapons to the world after the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain is fast losing its market share in the global arms business.\n\nThe report predicted that within ten years, French suppliers may outperform their Russian competitors owing to the sharp rise in recent sales and prospective orders of arms to nations across Asia, Oceania, and West Asia.\n\nFrom 7.1% in 2013-17 to 11% in 2018-22, France saw a 44% rise in its share of the world's exports of defence goods. The largest clients were Egypt, Qatar, and India.\n\nAt the same time, Russia's percentage of global weapons exports decreased by 31%, from 22% in the five years prior to 2017 to 16% in the subsequent five years.\n\nWhat went wrong with Russia?\n\nAccording to the report, sales to China and Egypt, two of Russia's largest markets, were under pressure during the past three years, which caused the decline in exports.\n\nAlong with rising Chinese self-sufficiency, Russia's near-pariah status among some nations prior to and after its full invasion of Ukraine in February of last year appears to have been a significant drag on exports.\n\nThe authors of the Sipri report, titled Trends in International Arms Transfers, state that it is likely that order quantities from these Egypt and China will decrease in the upcoming years.\n\n\"Egypt, for instance, cancelled a sizable order for combat planes in 2022, likely as a result of pressure from the US, and China is less dependent on imports of Russian major arms as it increases domestic production of such weapons,\" said the report.\n\nAccording to the study, since 1992, combat aircraft and combat helicopters have been among Russia's top weapons exports. In 2018-22, it shipped 328 of these, making up 40% of all Russian weapons exports during that time.\n\n\"By the end of 2022, it had only 84 combat planes and combat helicopters scheduled for delivery. As it is likely to prioritise producing weapons for its own military over those for sale, Russia's invasion of Ukraine will likely place additional restrictions on its ability to export arms.\n\nFor at least three decades, Russia has been the second-largest exporter of weapons in the world, with the selling of combat helicopters and aircraft serving as the backbone of its defence sector.\n\nAccording to Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at Sipri and co-author of the report, France could advance due to its proactive state policy of expanding its defence industry as well as the results of western diplomatic and economic sanctions against Russia in response to Vladimir Putin's invasion of the Ukraine.\n\nWezeman stated: \"Deliveries of weapons have sharply increased out of France. Meanwhile, the French government's support for the arms industry has enabled it to close more sizable weapons export contracts, with deliveries anticipated in the upcoming years,\" he said.\n\nFrance has significantly more major arms on order for sale than Russia, which raises the possibility that French arms exports will be on par with or even surpass those of Russia in the upcoming ten years.\n\nWhere does UK stand?\n\nThe UK's defence industry has recently struggled to reach agreements with important partners like Saudi Arabia, which has resulted in a 35% decrease in weapons exports and a 4.7% drop in the country's global share from 2013 to 2017 to just 3.2% in 2018-22.\n\nWezeman stated: \"Prior to 2018-2022, Saudi Arabia had been the largest customer of UK arms, but there are presently very few Saudi orders for major arms from the UK.\n\n\"An order for 48 Typhoon combat aircraft was still being discussed in 2020, but it appears that the transaction stalled in the years that followed.\n\nOver seven in ten (76%) of all arms exports come from the US, Russia, France, China, and Germany, which are also the top five defence producers.\n\nUS's dominance\n\nReport says, US continues to expand its position as the global superpower in the selling of arms.\n\nIn 2013-17 and 2018-22, its exports increased by 14%, and its percentage of all international weapons exports increased from 33% to 40%.\n\nOnly 41% of those sales went to the Middle East, but in the previous five years, the US provided major weapons to 103 states, which is almost as many as the next two biggest exporters combined.\n\nUkraine: Largest importer of Arms\n\nIn 2018-22, Ukraine grew to be a significant weapons importer. It was the world's third-largest importer of arms during that time span and ranked 14th overall.\n\nIndia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia, and China were the top five countries importing weapons between 2018 and 22.",

                    "body": "STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN: Arms imports into Europe almost doubled in 2022, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said Monday.\n\nWith a 93 percent jump compared to the year before, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nUkraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 percent of arms transfers to Europe and eight percent of world deliveries overall, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times' daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.\n\nWhole spectrum\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to put a dollar-value as many contracts are opaque, the global arms trade totals above $100 billion a year, and SIPRI said last year that total military expenditures had exceeded $2 trillion for the first time.\n\nEstimated military expenditures for 2022 by SIPRI will be released in April.\n\nThe surge in imports to Ukraine accelerated an already rising trend, as European states had already begun re-arming in the light of rising tension with Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nEuropean states have either \"already ordered or are planning to\" weapons ranging from \"submarines to combat aircraft, from drones to anti-tank missiles, from rifles to radars\", Wezeman said.\n\n\"Everything is being looked at, because the idea is to strengthen military capacity through the whole spectrum of available military technology.\"\n\nSIPRI prefers analyzing trends over half-decades as a few contracts can tilt yearly figures.\n\nOver the last five years (2018-2022), European imports have increased by 47 percent compared to the previous five years, while world transfers have declined by five percent, it said.\n\nImports dropping elsewhere\n\nUnlike Europe, all other continents have seen a decline in imports over the last five years.\n\nThere was a marked drop in Africa (-40 percent) and in North and South America (-20 percent), and declines as well in Asia (-7 percent) and the Middle East (-9 percent).\n\nIn another major shift, the Middle East became the leading destination for arms exports over the past year, accounting for 32 percent of the world total.\n\nIt jumped ahead of Asia-Oceania, which was in first place for years but fell to second in 2022, with 30 percent of the total and with Europe closing in with 27 percent.\n\nChina is continuing to spend heavily on its military but is increasingly producing its weapons locally, which leads to reduced exports to Asia, SIPRI said.\n\nThe main destinations for arms transfers were Qatar (10 percent of the world total), India (9 percent) and Ukraine (8 percent), followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (7 percent each) and Pakistan (5 percent).\n\nThe world's top five exporters over the past five years remained the United States (40 percent); Russia (16 percent); France (11 percent); China (5 percent); and Germany (4 percent).\n\nTogether they account for three quarters of all world exports.\n\nHowever, while the US and French shares have increased significantly, those of the other three have declined.",

                    "body": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year and China's growing self-sufficiency could have resulted in the fall of its exports\n\nFrance is challenging Russia's position as the world's second-largest arms exporter after the US, a report has said.\n\nFrance has witnessed a steep increase in sales and orders of arms from Asian, Middle Eastern and Oceania countries in the last five years, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe French share of the global defence exports was at 11 percent in 2018-22, up from 7.1& in 2013-17, a rise of 44%. Moreover, India, Qatar and Egypt were the biggest clients of French weapons.\n\nWith the rate of arms supplies in the last few years, French suppliers could surpass their Russian rivals within a decade.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian exports decreased in the last three years as the two largest importers- China and Egypt came under pressure, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\nAlong with Russia, the UK's share of the global market has also fallen.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine last year and China's growing self-sufficiency could have resulted in the fall of its exports.\n\n\"It is likely that order volumes from these two states will reduce in the coming years,\" the authors of the SIPRI report, titled Trends in International Arms Transfers, said.\n\n\"Egypt, for example, cancelled a large order for combat aircraft in 2022, probably due to pressure from the USA, and China is becoming less reliant on Russian imports as it ramps up domestic production of advanced major arms,\" they said.\n\nThey further said that the low volume of deliveries suggests that arms exports are likely to continue to fall in the coming years.\n\n\"Combat aircraft and combat helicopters have been among Russia's main arms exports since 1992. It delivered a total of 328 of these in 2018-22, which accounted for 40% of Russian arms exports in the period,\" the report said.\n\nHowever, by the end of 2022, Moscow had pending deliveries for only 84 combat aircraft and helicopters.\n\nRussia's war on Ukraine will likely put more constraints on Russia's ability to export arms since it will prioritise the production of arms for its own military rather than export.\n\nIt has been the world's second biggest arms exports for three decades with the supply of combat helicopters and aircraft being the backbone of its defence industry.\n\nFrance has more major arms on order for export than Russia currently and in the coming years, French arms will be in the same order of magnitude as Russia.\n\n\"France has seen a steep increase in arms exports in terms of deliveries. At the same time, the French arms industry, supported by the French government, has succeeded in signing more large deals for arms exports, with deliveries planned over coming years,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI said.\n\nThe five biggest defence exporters include the US, Russia, France, China and Germany, which account for a total of 76% of all arms exports. US, which remains at the top, exported 40 percent of the global arms exports.",

                    "body": "Russia has lost its share of global arms exports over the past five years as the invasion of Ukraine limited supplies and demand from most traditional partners declined in 2022, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) think tank said in a new report Monday.\n\nWhile Russia accounted for 22% of global arms sales in 2013-17, that figure dropped to 16% in 2018-22.\n\nThe country's arms exports fell by 31% over the same period, according to SIPRI.\n\nIndia, the largest buyer of Russian weapons, imported 37% fewer arms from Russia between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Seven of Russia's other top arms recipients averaged 59% fewer imports.\n\nChina and Egypt were the only two top buyers to increase purchases, at 39% and 44% respectively, and become Russia's second and third largest arms importers.\n\nSIPRI said five-year periods give a more stable measure of arms transfer trends because deliveries can fluctuate on a yearly basis.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine will likely further limit its arms exports because the Kremlin \"will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions\" as well as pressure by the United States and its allies to avoid buying Russian arms, said SIPRI's senior researcher Siemon Wezeman.\n\nThe decline has widened Russia's gap with the U.S. -- which dominates global arms exports at 40% -- and narrowed Moscow's gap with the third-biggest arms exporter France, whose share increased from 7.1% to 11%.\n\nUkraine became the world's third-largest arms importer, accounting for 2% of the global share in 2022, as a result of U.S. and EU military aid.\n\nEuropean countries have increased major arms imports by 47% as tensions with Russia rose over its invasion of pro-Western Ukraine.\n\nGlobal international arms transfers grew 5.1%, SIPRI said.",

                    "body": "Fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, countries in Europe are also increasing their arms imports, the think tank says.\n\nCountries in Europe have sharply increased their imports of major weapons in response to tensions with Russia, a prominent think tank has said, with Ukraine emerging as the world's third-largest arms importer following Moscow's invasion last year.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in a new report on Monday, said European states bucked global trends and increased their imports of major arms by 47 percent in the five-year period between 2018 and 2022.\n\nNATO states in Europe saw an even larger increase, growing their imports of major weaponry by 65 percent in the same period.\n\nIn contrast, global levels of arms transfers decreased by 5.1 percent.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" said Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster,\" he added.\n\nThe United States, France and South Korea were the biggest suppliers to NATO states in Europe over the past five years, while the US, Poland, Germany and the United Kingdom supplied the most weapons to Ukraine last year.\n\nMany of the arms supplied to Ukraine, however, were second-hand items from existing stocks. They included some 228 artillery pieces and an estimated 5,000 guided artillery rockets from the US, 280 tanks from Poland and more than 7,000 anti-tank missiles from the UK, SIPRI said.\n\nThe war in Ukraine also had a limited impact on the total volume of arms in the past five-year period, it added.\n\nMeanwhile, although the level of US arms exports to Ukraine saw a sharp increase, it was still below the levels Washington sent to four other states last year - Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Japan, SIPRI said. This is because US supplies to Ukraine involved relatively less advanced and mainly second-hand military equipment, while the other four states received advanced new weapons, such as combat aircraft and air defence systems, the think tank added.\n\nThe US remained the world's leading defence exporter, and its share of global arms exports rose to 40 percent from 33 percent in the past five years.\n\nBut the share of Russia, the world's second-largest supplier, fell to 16 percent from 22 percent.\n\n\"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports,\" said Siemon T Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. \"This is because Russia will prioritise supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the US and its allies not to buy Russian arms.\"\n\nFor example, Egypt, one of Russia's biggest customers, cancelled a large order for combat aircraft in 2022, probably due to US pressure, SIPRI said.\n\nAs Russia's arms exports declined, France, the world's third-largest supplier, has gained a bigger share of the global weapons trade, SIPRI said. France's share increased from 7.1 percent to 11 percent in the period between 2018 and 2022, due to exports to states in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East.\n\nThe trend seems likely to continue as, by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia, SIPRI said.\n\nSimilar to Europe, East Asia - another region with high geopolitical tension - saw a sharp increase in arms imports.\n\nThe biggest increases in the region were by US allies, South Korea and Japan at 61 percent and 171 percent, respectively. Australia also increased its imports by 23 percent.\n\nSIPRI attributed the increase to \"growing perceptions of threats from China and North Korea\" and said the main supplier for all three countries was the US.\n\nAll three were acquiring long-strike weapons, such as advanced combat aircraft and missiles, SIPRI said.\n\nChina's imports also saw a 4.1 percent increase, with most of the transfers coming from Russia, it added.",

                    "title": "Russia Is Still India's Largest Arms Supplier But Its Position Is Under 'Pressure', Latest SIPRI Report Says",
                    "body": "New Delhi: Russia continues to be the largest arms supplier of India, but its share in New Delhi's total arms imports has come down to 45 percent during the period 2018-2022 from 64 percent earlier, according to the latest data on international transfers of major arms by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). SIPRI is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.\n\nAccording to the SIPRI data, which was released Monday, India continues to be the world's largest arms importer and the largest recipient of Russian arms. The report also noted that the demand for arms in India is on a rise due to the ongoing tensions with China and Pakistan.\n\n\"India's tensions with Pakistan and China largely drive its demand for arms imports. With an 11 per cent share of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-22, a position it has held for the period 1993-2022,\" said the report titled 'Trends in International Arms Transfers, 2022'.\n\nThe report also said imports of weaponry by India from Russia, France, the US and others have slowed down by 11 per cent in 2018-22 compared to 2013-2017. This is mainly because of the government's 'Atmanirbhar' or self-reliance mission in defence manufacturing, slow and complex arms procurement process and efforts to diversify its arms suppliers.\n\nThe SIPRI data also showed that while Russia continues to be topmost arms seller to India, its share has gone down owing to strong competition from other suppliers like France and the US, increased arms production under the indigenous route and due to the ongoing Ukraine war.\n\nThe five largest arms importers in 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China. Together, these five countries accounted for 36 per cent of the world's arms imports, said SIPRI.\n\nSiemon T. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme, said: \"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports. This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the USA and its allies not to buy Russian arms.\"\n\nFrance has replaced the US as India's second-largest arms supplier due to the import of 62 combat aircraft and four submarines. India's import of weaponry from France increased by 489 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, the SIPRI data noted.\n\n\"'France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example ... This seems likely to continue, as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia,\" said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nDuring the period 2018-22, US, Russia, France, China and Germany emerged as the top five arms exporters to the world.\n\n\"US and French arms exports rose between 2013-17 and 2018-22, while Russian, Chinese and German arms exports fell,\" said SIPRI.\n\nAccording to SIPRI's research, China accounted for 5.2 per cent of total global arms exports in 2018-22. But Beijing's arms exports decreased by 23 percent between 2013-17 and 2018-22.\n\n\"The vast majority of Chinese arms exports (80 per cent) went to states in Asia and Oceania. China delivered major arms to 46 states in 2018-22, but over half of its arms exports (54 per cent) went to just one state -- Pakistan,\" the report said.\n\nArms imports by Pakistan increased by 14 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22 and accounted for 3.7 per cent of the total. China supplied over three quarters (77 per cent) of Pakistan's arms imports in 2018-22, the report showed.\n\nIt also noted that China is increasingly becoming \"less reliant\" on Russian imports owing to the ramping up of domestic production in that country of advanced major arms.\n\nThe SIPRI report also noted that Ukraine, which imported a handful of arms between 1991 to 2021-end, turned out to be the world's third largest arms importer due to the war, which began in February 2022.\n\n\"From 1991 until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported a few major arms. As a result of military aid from the USA and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) and the 14th biggest for 2018-22. Ukraine accounted for 2.0 per cent of global arms imports in the five-year period,\" it said.\n\nThe report added: \"Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,\" said Wezeman.",

Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), said in a statement.\n\nSIPRI defines major arms as aircraft, warships, tanks, artillery, missiles and various heavy defense systems.\n\nEuropean states in the US-led NATO alliance increased their arms imports by 65 percent from the previous five-year period. But worldwide, international arms transfers fell 5.1 percent, according to SIPRI.\n\nThe United States and Russia have been the world's largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nUS arms exports increased by 14 percent from 2013-17, and the US accounted for 40 percent of global arms exports. Russia's share fell to 16 percent from 22 percent.\n\n\"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports,\" SIPRI's Siemon T. Wezeman said.\n\n\"This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nIn 2022, SIPRI warned that the global nuclear arsenal was likely to grow in the coming years.\n\nRead more:\n\nSaudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt rank in top 10 largest arms importers over past 5 years\n\nUS to vet human rights more closely before approving arms deals: Officials\n\nIraq signs contracts with US, France to import advanced weapons: State news agency",

                    "body": "Stockholm: Arms imports into Europe almost doubled in 2022, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said Monday.\n\nWith a 93 per cent jump compared to the year before, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nUkraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 per cent of arms transfers to Europe and eight percent of world deliveries overall, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.\n\n'Whole spectrum'\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to put a dollar-value as many contracts are opaque, the global arms trade totals above $100 billion a year, and SIPRI said last year that total military expenditures had exceeded $2 trillion for the first time.\n\nEstimated military expenditures for 2022 by SIPRI will be released in April.\n\nThe surge in imports to Ukraine accelerated an already rising trend, as European states had already begun re-arming in the light of rising tension with Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nEuropean states have either \"already ordered or are planning to\" weapons ranging from \"submarines to combat aircraft, from drones to anti-tank missiles, from rifles to radars\", Wezeman said.\n\n\"Everything is being looked at, because the idea is to strengthen military capacity through the whole spectrum of available military technology.\"\n\nSIPRI prefers analysing trends over half-decades as a few contracts can tilt yearly figures.\n\nOver the last five years (2018-2022), European imports have increased by 47 per cent compared to the previous five years, while world transfers have declined by five percent, it said.\n\nImports dropping elsewhere\n\nUnlike Europe, all other continents have seen a decline in imports over the last five years.\n\nThere was a marked drop in Africa (-40 per cent) and in North and South America (-20 per cent), and declines as well in Asia (-7 per cent) and the Middle East (-9 per cent).\n\nIn another major shift, the Middle East became the leading destination for arms exports over the past year, accounting for 32 per cent of the world total.\n\nIt jumped ahead of Asia-Oceania, which was in first place for years but fell to second in 2022, with 30 percent of the total and with Europe closing in with 27 per cent.\n\nChina is continuing to spend heavily on its military but is increasingly producing its weapons locally, which leads to reduced exports to Asia, SIPRI said.\n\nThe main destinations for arms transfers were Qatar (10 per cent of the world total), India (9 per cent) and Ukraine (8 per cent), followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (7 per cent each) and Pakistan (5 per cent).\n\nThe world's top five exporters over the past five years remained the United States (40 per cent); Russia (16 per cent); France (11 per cent); China (5 per cent); and Germany (4 per cent).\n\nTogether they account for three quarters of all world exports.\n\nHowever, while the US and French shares have increased significantly, those of the other three have declined.",

The United States and Russia have been the largest and second largest arms exporters over the past three decades, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said in a press release on Monday.\n\nAccording to the SIPRI's new data on global arms transfers in 2018-2022, Russia's arms exports declined by 31% in the period against the previous five years, while Ukraine became the world's third largest arms importer in 2022.\n\nGlobal arms exports have long been dominated by the US and Russia, but the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and France, ranked third for arms supplies, has narrowed, the SIPRI said.\n\nUS arms sales rose by 14% between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, and the US accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018-2022. Russia's arms exports declined by 31% in the same period, while its share of global arms exports fell from 22% to 16%, and that of France rose from 7.1% to 11%.\n\nLast year, Ukraine became the world's third biggest arms importer. In 1991-2021, the former Soviet republic imported few major arms, but as a result of military assistance from the US and many European countries it became the third largest importer of major arms during 2022, trailing Qatar and India, and the 14th largest for 2018-2022. Ukraine's share of global arms imports in the five-year period amounted to 2%, the SIPRI said.\n\n\"Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,\" writes Pieter Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program.",

                    "body": "Russia's share of global arms exports declined sharply in the most recent five-year period, as Western sanctions against Moscow and the Kremlin's own need to conserve weaponry for its ongoing war effort in Ukraine limited sales abroad, new data from an influential research group showed.\n\nRussia's share of global arms exports declined from 22 percent in the 2013-2017 period to 16 percent in 2018-22, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published on March 13.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States remained the global leader in arms exports, with its share rising to 40 percent from 33 percent in the same five-year period.\n\n\"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports,\" said Pieter Wezeman, a senior SIPRI researcher.\n\n\"This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces, and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the U.S.A. and its allies not to buy Russian arms,\" he added.\n\nSIPRI noted that arms exports worldwide have long been dominated by the United States and Russia, with the two countries ranking first and second over the past three decades.\n\nBut Russia's gap over France, the third-biggest exporter, narrowed, with Paris's share rising to 11 percent from 7.1 percent.\n\n\"France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example,\" Wezeman said.\n\n\"This seems likely to continue, as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia.\"\n\nU.S. arms exports rose 14 percent from the 2013-17 period to 2018-22, while Russia's exports tumbled 31 percent. France's exports rose 44 percent, mainly to states in Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East.\n\nIndia received 30 percent of France's arms in the recent five-year period, surpassing the United States as the second-largest supplier of weaponry to New Delhi.\n\nRussian remained the largest supplier to India of arms exports and managed to increase sales to two large nations -- China by 39 percent and Egypt by 44 percent over the period.\n\nUkraine became the third-largest arms importer globally in 2022 as Kyiv continues to battle against the full-scale invasion by Russian forces, a major change from the nation's actions over previous decades.\n\n\"From 1991 until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms,\" the report said.\n\n\"As a result of military aid from the U.S.A. and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the third-biggest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India).\"\n\nIt said Ukraine accounted for 2 percent of global arms imports in the five-year period.\n\nEuropean NATO nations hiked their arms imports 65 percent \"as they sought to strengthen their arsenals in response to a perceived heightened threat from Russia,\" the report said.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster,\" Wezeman added.\n\nThe European increase came as the global level of international arms transfers dipped 5.1 percent over the five-year period.\n\nSIPRI, an independent international institute focusing on research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament, was established in 1966.",

                    "body": "STOCKHOLM - Arms imports into Europe almost doubled in 2022, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said on Monday.\n\nWith a 93 per cent jump compared to the year before, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Mr Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nUkraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 percent of arms transfers to Europe and eight percent of world deliveries overall, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.\n\nAlthough it is difficult put a dollar-value as many contracts are opaque, the global arms trade totals above US$100 billion (S$134.7 billion) a year, and SIPRI said last year that total military expenditures had exceeded US$2 trillion for the first time.\n\nEstimated military expenditures for 2022 by SIPRI will be released in April.\n\nThe surge in imports to Ukraine accelerated an already rising trend, as European states had already begun re-arming in the light of rising tension with Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",

                    "body": "France is challenging Russia's position as the world's second biggest arms exporter behind the US, while Britain's share of the global market has dwindled, an analysis has found.\n\nA steep increase in sales and future orders of arms to countries in Asia, Oceania and the Middle East over the last five years suggests French suppliers could surpass their Russian rivals within a decade.\n\nFrance's share of global defence exports stood at 11% in the period 2018-22, up from 7.1% in 2013-17 - a 44% increase. India, Qatar and Egypt were the biggest clients.\n\nAt the same time, Russia's share of the world's arms exports fell by 31% - from nearly a quarter of all sales (22%) in the five years to 2017 down to 16% over the last five years.\n\nThe collapse in Russian exports occurred in the last three years, with sales to China and Egypt, two of its biggest markets, coming under pressure, according to an analysis by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\nRussia's near-pariah status among some countries in the lead-up to and following its full invasion of Ukraine in February last year appears to have been a major drag on exports, along with growing Chinese self-sufficiency.\n\n\"It is likely that order volumes from these two states will reduce in the coming years,\" say the authors of the Sipri report, entitled Trends in International Arms Transfers. \"Egypt, for example, cancelled a large order for combat aircraft in 2022, probably due to pressure from the USA, and China is becoming less reliant on Russian imports as it ramps up domestic production of advanced major arms.\n\n\"The low volume of pending deliveries of major arms from Russia indicates that its arms exports are likely to continue to drop in the coming years.\"\n\nThe report adds: \"Combat aircraft and combat helicopters have been among Russia's main arms exports since 1992. It delivered a total of 328 of these in 2018-22, which accounted for 40% of Russian arms exports in the period.\n\nRelated: Campaigners seek to overturn Liz Truss's resumption of Saudi arms sales\n\n\"By the end of 2022, it had pending deliveries for only 84 combat aircraft and combat helicopters. Russia's invasion of Ukraine will probably put additional constraints on Russia's ability to export arms, as it is likely to prioritise the production of arms for its own military over those for export.\"\n\nRussia has been the world's second biggest arms exporter for at least three decades, the sale of combat helicopters and aircraft being the mainstay of its defence industry.\n\nPieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at Sipri and one of the report's authors, said France could nudge ahead, given the activism of the French state in expanding its defence sector and the impact of western sanctions and diplomatic efforts on Russia following Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWezeman said: \"France has seen a steep increase in arms exports in terms of deliveries. At the same time, the French arms industry, supported by the French government, has succeeded in signing more large deals for arms exports, with deliveries planned over [the] coming years.\n\n\"France has considerably more major arms on order for export than Russia, which suggests that it is possible that in the coming decade French arms exports will be in the same order of magnitude, or even larger than those of Russia.\"\n\nRelated: Yemen: 87 civilians killed by UK and US weapons in just over a year\n\nThe UK's defence sector has failed to seal deals with key partners such as Saudi Arabia in recent years, leading to its arms exports contracting by over a third (35%), reducing the country's global share of arms exports from 4.7% between 2013 and 2017 to just 3.2% in 2018-22.\n\nWezeman said: \"Saudi Arabia had been the largest recipient of UK arms in the previous two five-year periods, before 2018-2022, but very few Saudi orders for major arms from the UK are currently in place.\n\n\"In 2020, there was still talk about plans for an order for 48 Typhoon combat aircraft, but that deal seems to have stalled in the years after.\n\nThe five largest defence exporters are the US, Russia, France, China and Germany, which account for over three-quarters (76%) of all arms exports.\n\nThe US remains the world's superpower in arms sales - and is building on its role. Its exports grew by 14% in 2013-17 and 2018-22 and its share of total global arms exports rose from 33% to 40%.\n\nJust under half of those sales (41%) went to the Middle East, but the US delivered major arms to 103 states in the last five-year period, almost as many as the next two biggest exporters combined.\n\nUkraine became a major importer of arms in 2018-22. It was the 14th largest arms importer globally in the period and the third largest in 2022. The five largest arms importers in 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.",

                    "body": "Study shows French suppliers have more major export orders than Russia, while UK's share has dwindled\n\nFrance is challenging Russia's position as the world's second biggest arms exporter behind the US, while Britain's share of the global market has dwindled, an analysis has found.\n\nA steep increase in sales and future orders of arms to countries in Asia, Oceania and the Middle East over the last five years suggests French suppliers could surpass their Russian rivals within a decade.\n\nFrance's share of global defence exports stood at 11% in the period 2018-22, up from 7.1% in 2013-17 - a 44% increase. India, Qatar and Egypt were the biggest clients.\n\nAt the same time, Russia's share of the world's arms exports fell by 31% - from nearly a quarter of all sales (22%) in the five years to 2017 down to 16% over the last five years.\n\nThe collapse in Russian exports occurred in the last three years, with sales to China and Egypt, two of its biggest markets, coming under pressure, according to an analysis by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\nRussia's near-pariah status among some countries in the lead-up to and following its full invasion of Ukraine in February last year appears to have been a major drag on exports, along with growing Chinese self-sufficiency.\n\n\"It is likely that order volumes from these two states will reduce in the coming years,\" say the authors of the Sipri report, entitled Trends in International Arms Transfers. \"Egypt, for example, cancelled a large order for combat aircraft in 2022, probably due to pressure from the USA, and China is becoming less reliant on Russian imports as it ramps up domestic production of advanced major arms.\n\n\"The low volume of pending deliveries of major arms from Russia indicates that its arms exports are likely to continue to drop in the coming years.\"\n\nThe report adds: \"Combat aircraft and combat helicopters have been among Russia's main arms exports since 1992. It delivered a total of 328 of these in 2018-22, which accounted for 40% of Russian arms exports in the period.\n\n\"By the end of 2022, it had pending deliveries for only 84 combat aircraft and combat helicopters. Russia's invasion of Ukraine will probably put additional constraints on Russia's ability to export arms, as it is likely to prioritise the production of arms for its own military over those for export.\"\n\nRussia has been the world's second biggest arms exporter for at least three decades, the sale of combat helicopters and aircraft being the mainstay of its defence industry.\n\nPieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at Sipri and one of the report's authors, said France could nudge ahead, given the activism of the French state in expanding its defence sector and the impact of western sanctions and diplomatic efforts on Russia following Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWezeman said: \"France has seen a steep increase in arms exports in terms of deliveries. At the same time, the French arms industry, supported by the French government, has succeeded in signing more large deals for arms exports, with deliveries planned over [the] coming years.\n\n\"France has considerably more major arms on order for export than Russia, which suggests that it is possible that in the coming decade French arms exports will be in the same order of magnitude, or even larger than those of Russia.\"\n\nThe UK's defence sector has failed to seal deals with key partners such as Saudi Arabia in recent years, leading to its arms exports contracting by over a third (35%), reducing the country's global share of arms exports from 4.7% between 2013 and 2017 to just 3.2% in 2018-22.\n\nWezeman said: \"Saudi Arabia had been the largest recipient of UK arms in the previous two five-year periods, before 2018-2022, but very few Saudi orders for major arms from the UK are currently in place.\n\n\"In 2020, there was still talk about plans for an order for 48 Typhoon combat aircraft, but that deal seems to have stalled in the years after.\n\nThe five largest defence exporters are the US, Russia, France, China and Germany, which account for over three-quarters (76%) of all arms exports.\n\nThe US remains the world's superpower in arms sales - and is building on its role. Its exports grew by 14% in 2013-17 and 2018-22 and its share of total global arms exports rose from 33% to 40%.\n\nJust under half of those sales (41%) went to the Middle East, but the US delivered major arms to 103 states in the last five-year period, almost as many as the next two biggest exporters combined.\n\nUkraine became a major importer of arms in 2018-22. It was the 14th largest arms importer globally in the period and the third largest in 2022. The five largest arms importers in 2018-22 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China.",

                    "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - European states increased their imports of major weaponry by 47% in the five years to 2022, while the United States' share of global arms exports rose to 40% from 33%, a leading conflict think-tank said on Monday.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine last year, following years of growing tensions, has prompted European countries to rush to bolster their defences.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), said in a statement.\n\nSIPRI defines major arms as aircraft, warships, tanks, artillery, missiles and various heavy defence systems.\n\nEuropean states in the U.S.-led NATO alliance increased their arms imports by 65% from the previous five-year period. But worldwide, international arms transfers fell 5.1%, according to SIPRI.\n\nThe United States and Russia have been the world's largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nU.S. arms exports increased by 14% from 2013-17, and the U.S. accounted for 40% of global arms exports. Russia's share fell to 16% from 22%.\n\n\"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports,\" SIPRI's Siemon T. Wezeman said. \"This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nIn 2022, SIPRI warned that the global nuclear arsenal was likely to grow in the coming years.\n\n(Reporting by Johan Ahlander; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

The Kingdom received 9.6 percent of all arms imports during that period. Saudi arms purchases during 2022 included aircraft, air defense systems, armored vehicles, missiles, naval weapons, sensors and ships.\n\nSaudi Arabia's main suppliers and their share of its total imports: US (78 percent), France (6.4 percent) and Spain (4.9 percent). The US arms transfers to Saudi Arabia included \"the delivery of 91 combat aircraft with hundreds of land-attack missiles and over 20,000 guided bombs,\" according to SIPRI's report.\n\nThe Kingdom's overall imports decreased by 8.7 percent when comparing between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022.\n\nQatar ranked as the third largest arms importer over the past five years, climbing up from being ranked sixth over the prior five-year period.

SIPRI highlighted: \"Notable arms imports in 2018-22 included hundreds of air defense missiles and over 20,000 guided bombs from the US.\"\n\nThe highest majority of arms and weapons imports to the Middle East came from the US (54 percent), followed by France (12 percent), Russia (8.6 percent) and Italy (8.4 percent). SIPRI data showed that those imports included more than 260 advanced combat aircraft, 516 new tanks and 13 frigates. The think-tank highlighted that \"Arab states in the Gulf region alone have placed orders for another more than 180 combat aircraft.\"\n\nHowever, overall arms imports to the Middle East were down 8.8 percent when comparing between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the global overall ranking of the top ten largest arms importers over the past five years were: India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia, China, Egypt, South Korea, Pakistan, Japan, US. And the top 10 largest arms exporters were: US, Russia, France, China, Germany, Italy, UK, Spain, South Korea and Israel.\n\nSIPRI's statistical data on arms transfers relates to actual deliveries of major arm.

                    "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - European states increased their imports of major weaponry by 47% in the five years to 2022, while the United States' share of global arms exports rose to 40% from 33%, a leading conflict think-tank said on Monday.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine last year, following years of growing tensions, has prompted European countries to rush to bolster their defences.\n\n\"Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,\" Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), said in a statement.\n\nSIPRI defines major arms as aircraft, warships, tanks, artillery, missiles and various heavy defence systems.\n\nEuropean states in the U.S.-led NATO alliance increased their arms imports by 65% from the previous five-year period. But worldwide, international arms transfers fell 5.1%, according to SIPRI.\n\nThe United States and Russia have been the world's largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.\n\nU.S. arms exports increased by 14% from 2013-17, and the U.S. accounted for 40% of global arms exports. Russia's share fell to 16% from 22%.\n\n\"It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports,\" SIPRI's Siemon T. Wezeman said. \"This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nIn 2022, SIPRI warned that the global nuclear arsenal was likely to grow in the coming years.",

                    "body": "'The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe,' said Pieter Wezeman at SIPRI - Copyright AFP Aris Messinis\n\nArms imports into Europe almost doubled in 2022, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said Monday.\n\nWith a 93 percent jump compared to the year before, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nUkraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 percent of arms transfers to Europe and eight percent of world deliveries overall, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.\n\n- 'Whole spectrum' -\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to put a dollar-value as many contracts are opaque, the global arms trade totals above $100 billion a year, and SIPRI said last year that total military expenditures had exceeded $2 trillion for the first time.\n\nEstimated military expenditures for 2022 by SIPRI will be released in April.\n\nThe surge in imports to Ukraine accelerated an already rising trend, as European states had already begun re-arming in the light of rising tension with Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nEuropean states have either \"already ordered or are planning to\" weapons ranging from \"submarines to combat aircraft, from drones to anti-tank missiles, from rifles to radars\", Wezeman said.\n\n\"Everything is being looked at, because the idea is to strengthen military capacity through the whole spectrum of available military technology.\"\n\nSIPRI prefers analysing trends over half-decades as a few contracts can tilt yearly figures.\n\nOver the last five years (2018-2022), European imports have increased by 47 percent compared to the previous five years, while world transfers have declined by five percent, it said.\n\n- Imports dropping elsewhere -\n\nUnlike Europe, all other continents have seen a decline in imports over the last five years.\n\nThere was a marked drop in Africa (-40 percent) and in North and South America (-20 percent), and declines as well in Asia (-7 percent) and the Middle East (-9 percent).\n\nIn another major shift, the Middle East became the leading destination for arms exports over the past year, accounting for 32 percent of the world total.\n\nIt jumped ahead of Asia-Oceania, which was in first place for years but fell to second in 2022, with 30 percent of the total and with Europe closing in with 27 percent.\n\nChina is continuing to spend heavily on its military but is increasingly producing its weapons locally, which leads to reduced exports to Asia, SIPRI said.\n\nThe main destinations for arms transfers were Qatar (10 percent of the world total), India (9 percent) and Ukraine (8 percent), followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (7 percent each) and Pakistan (5 percent).\n\nThe world's top five exporters over the past five years remained the United States (40 percent); Russia (16 percent); France (11 percent); China (5 percent); and Germany (4 percent).\n\nTogether they account for three quarters of all world exports.\n\nHowever, while the US and French shares have increased significantly, those of the other three have declined.",

                    "body": "Arms imports into Europe almost doubled in 2022, driven by massive shipments to Ukraine, which has become the world's third-largest destination, researchers said Monday.\n\nWith a 93 percent jump compared to the year before, imports have also increased due to accelerating military spending by European states including Poland and Norway, said the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAnd the rate of imports is expected to accelerate further, it said.\n\n\"The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,\" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told AFP.\n\nUkraine was until last year a negligible importer of arms.\n\nBut in 2022 it very quickly became the third-largest arms destination in the world, behind Qatar and India, as Western nations delivered arms following Russia's invasion.\n\nUkraine alone accounted for 31 percent of arms transfers to Europe and eight percent of world deliveries overall, according to SIPRI's data.\n\nUkraine's imports, including donations, grew more than 60-fold last year, the institute found.\n\nThe deliveries to Ukraine were mainly weapons lifted from stockpiles.\n\nAmong them were some 230 artillery pieces from the US; 280 Polish armoured vehicles; and more than 7,000 British anti-tank missiles, as well as more newly produced pieces such as anti-aircraft systems, SIPRI said.\n\n- 'Whole spectrum' -\n\nIn its rankings of the global arms trade, the institute uses its own units of value, rather than dollars or euros.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to put a dollar-value as many contracts are opaque, the global arms trade totals above $100 billion a year, and SIPRI said last year that total military expenditures had exceeded $2 trillion for the first time.\n\nEstimated military expenditures for 2022 by SIPRI will be released in April.\n\nThe surge in imports to Ukraine accelerated an already rising trend, as European states had already begun re-arming in the light of rising tension with Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nEuropean states have either \"already ordered or are planning to\" weapons ranging from \"submarines to combat aircraft, from drones to anti-tank missiles, from rifles to radars\", Wezeman said.\n\n\"Everything is being looked at, because the idea is to strengthen military capacity through the whole spectrum of available military technology.\"\n\nSIPRI prefers analysing trends over half-decades as a few contracts can tilt yearly figures.\n\nOver the last five years (2018-2022), European imports have increased by 47 percent compared to the previous five years, while world transfers have declined by five percent, it said.\n\n- Imports dropping elsewhere -\n\nUnlike Europe, all other continents have seen a decline in imports over the last five years.\n\nThere was a marked drop in Africa (-40 percent) and in North and South America (-20 percent), and declines as well in Asia (-7 percent) and the Middle East (-9 percent).\n\nIn another major shift, the Middle East became the leading destination for arms exports over the past year, accounting for 32 percent of the world total.\n\nIt jumped ahead of Asia-Oceania, which was in first place for years but fell to second in 2022, with 30 percent of the total and with Europe closing in with 27 percent.\n\nChina is continuing to spend heavily on its military but is increasingly producing its weapons locally, which leads to reduced exports to Asia, SIPRI said.\n\nThe main destinations for arms transfers were Qatar (10 percent of the world total), India (9 percent) and Ukraine (8 percent), followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (7 percent each) and Pakistan (5 percent).\n\nThe world's top five exporters over the past five years remained the United States (40 percent); Russia (16 percent); France (11 percent); China (5 percent); and Germany (4 percent).\n\nTogether they account for three quarters of all world exports.\n\nHowever, while the US and French shares have increased significantly, those of the other three have declined.",

                    "body": "The invasion of Ukraine has benefited the US and led to a major increase in arms imports to Europe. In other parts of the world, however, the movement of weapons between nations is declining.\n\nWhile the rest of the world is slowly disarming, Europe is quickly doing the opposite, according to the latest report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The institute examines and compares the global arms trade in four-year periods, the better to reflect overall trends than looking at the weapons business over only twelve months.\n\nAmong the two most important trends in the most recent report, SIPRI researcher Pieter Wezeman told DW, are that arms transfers to European states have significantly increased\" and that \"the role of the US as an arms supplier in the world has increased significantly, too.\"\n\nIn the most recent period examined, 2018-22, the international arms trade declined by just over 5% compared to 2013-17. In contrast, arms imports by European countries -- the vast majority of which came from the United States -- increased by 47%, and those by European NATO countries by as much as 65%. The reason behind that is, unsurprisingly, the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn the past, Ukraine was not a major player in the international arms trade. It made much of its defense equipment on home soil, and the rest was left over from the Soviet era. In SIPRI's latest report, however, it ranks 14th on the list of worldwide weapons importers and if you consider 2022 alone, Ukraine comes third.\n\nSIPRI usually refers to \"arms transfers\" in its report, meaning both the arms trade and [free] military assistance, the latter of which is Ukraine's main supply of weapons. This kind of military aid usually consists of older equipment or surplus stock from donor nations.\n\nThe report shows how, because of this, what has been delivered to Ukraine pales in a value comparison to sales of new weapons. For example, despite massive US arms deliveries to Ukraine in 2022, Washington still sent goods worth greater value to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Japan. Those four countries bought particularly new and sophisticated equipment such as fighter jets, something Ukraine has been urgently requesting from Western allies.\n\nThe five biggest arms exporters are, in order: the US, Russia, France, China and Germany. While this ranking hasn't changed since the last report, there have been significant changes with regard to the individual countries.\n\nFor example, the US, already top of the list, increased exports by another 14% and now accounts for 40% of global arms transfers.\n\nA much bigger increase of 44% was recorded by France, which was able to expand its position as number three. Such sharp changes are not unusual, however, according to SIPRI, because there can be particularly large and lucrative orders within a given timeframe.\n\nThis is also how Pieter Wezeman explains the sharp drop in the German defense business at 35% less than in the previous report. But, said Wezeman, this time, \"the change in the arms exports by France is maybe more structural in nature. France has put a lot of emphasis on trying to support its arms industry and has clearly succeeded in doing so in the past decade.\"\n\nThis was clearly on the mind of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during a recent visit to India. Western powers are trying to encourage New Delhi to rely less on Russia for arms. And while France has spent years establishing itself as India's second biggest supplier after Moscow, Germany does not play a role in Indian arms imports at all.\n\nAlso striking is the 23% dip in Chinese arms exports and, in general, China's low importance as a global arms exporter compared to its economy as a whole. Wezeman explained it this way: \" China has not succeeded to break into some of the major markets for arms, sometimes for clearly political reasons.\" As a result, he says, China does not sell arms to its rival, India, for example.\n\n\"Surprisingly enough,\" he added, China also \"hasn't really succeeded in competing against European and US arms suppliers to most of the Middle Eastern states, especially the Arab states.\"\n\nAs Europe began importing more weapons, its share of international arms transfers likewise increased, from 11% in 2013-17 to 16% in 2018-22. At the same time, arms transfers declined in all other regions of the world.\n\nOne of the most extreme cases was in Africa, where transfers went back by 40%. But that hasn't made the continent more peaceful, said Wezeman.\n\nThere are still numerous armed conflicts in Africa. However, he added, these \"countries are not able to really afford large numbers of advanced arms, and therefore in that sense, total arms transfer value to the region is not as high as the number of conflicts would maybe suggest.\"\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, Russia has now surpassed China as the biggest arms supplier. One example of Russia's push into Africa is Mali. The Sahel nation used to purchase arms from a host of countries, including France and the United States. However, after the coups in Mali in 2020 and 2021, these two Western countries began to shrink their business in the country significantly, while Russia expanded its sales.\n\nAnother example of the consequences of political upsets for arms cooperation -- in a different region -- is Turkey. The NATO member was the seventh largest buyer of US defense equipment in 2013-17. But as the relationship between Ankara and Washington has become more strained, Turkey now only ranks 27th.\n\nWho will be leading the international arms business in the future? To find out, SIPRI looked at the order books of manufacturers in the most important arms-exporting countries. Particular attention was paid to orders for combat aircraft and helicopters, as well as for larger warships such as aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, and submarines. These are weapons systems of particularly high value.\n\nThe US will therefore remain by far the world's biggest arms supplier. This is clear from the fact that around 60% of all combat airplanes and helicopters ordered worldwide are US products. In 2022 alone, 13 countries ordered a total of 376 combat airplanes and helicopters from US-based manufacturers.\n\nFrance has both many aircraft and many ship orders and is thus likely to further increase its position as an arms exporter. The outlook for Germany is mixed. There are no existing orders for German aircraft, but there have been a large number of naval vessels currently being made in German shipyards. Many German weapons that may have been exported are likely to end up being sent to Ukraine.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

                    "title": "Nations Importing the Most Weapons and Their Biggest Suppliers",
                    "body": "European nations increased arms imports by 47% in 2018-2022 compared to the previous five-year period. This increase, part of the findings of a report released today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, is likely at least in part a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war being fought there. The war-torn nation has received tens of billions in aid from the United States and other countries, and Ukraine's neighbors have been arming themselves as well.\n\nTo determine the countries importing the most weapons, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the Trends in International Arms Transfers, 2022 report by SIPRI. Countries are ranked by their share of imported arms out of global import volume from 2018 to 2022. Because volume can fluctuate greatly from year to year, SIPRI tracks arms transfers in five-year periods. Supplemental data on annual military expenditure in current U.S. dollars and military spending as a share of GDP are also from SIPRI and are for 2021, the most recent year for which data is available.\n\nFor the most recent five-year period, Ukraine is tied with Norway for the 14th largest importer of weapons, with 2% of the world's imports from 2018 to 2022. Unsurprisingly, that figure represents a substantial increase from the previous five-year period. Between 2013 and 2017, Ukraine accounted for less than 0.05% of the world's weapons imports, and arms exports to the country increased a staggering 8,631% between those two periods.\n\nUkraine's largest supplier is the United States, which just this month pledged its 33rd weapons aid package to the country, bringing the total it has supplied the beleaguered nation to more than $30 billion. In fact, the U.S. is the single largest supplier of arms for 19 of the 40 largest global weapons importers, and is among the top three sellers for 27. Another major supplier of arms to Ukraine is Poland, a nation that, like many of Ukraine's European neighbors, has a keen vested interest in the outcome of the war. (These are the countries buying the most weapons from the U.S. government.)\n\nA new entry to the list this year is not a country at all, but the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which accounted for 0.7% of global arms imports in the most recent period. Like Ukraine, that figure is up from less than 0.05% just five years ago. This does not include the additional imports of NATO member states, of which both the United States and Poland are members, but the organization itself. (These are all the NATO members ranked by military power.)",

                    "body": "The United States announced earlier this month it would send another $400 million in military equipment to Ukraine. The weapons, which include demolition munitions, mobile armored bridges, and additional High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, constituted the 33rd such package the U.S. has sent to the war-torn nation since August of 2021. In total, the U.S. has sent more than $30 billion in gear to Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion last February. Over the past five years, however, other countries were the top recipients of U.S. arms exports. (These are the countries sending the most aid to Ukraine.)\n\nThough many countries invest billions of dollars in defense each year, not all have arms industries sufficient to meet the needs of their own modern military. As a result, certain countries with robust weapons industries export tens of billions of dollars of armaments each year. The United States being chief among them.\n\nUsing data from the Trends in International Arms Transfers, 2022 report released today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, 24/7 Wall St. identified the 25 countries that are the largest exporters of arms. Countries are ranked on their share of total global arms exports from 2018 to 2022. The United States and Russia alone account for over half of all global arms exports.\n\nMany of the highest-ranking countries on this list are home to some of the world's largest defense contractors. The United States, which alone accounts for 40% of global arms exports, is home to 12 of the 25 largest defense contractors in the world, including Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin - the three largest. China, which is fourth among the world's exporters, has seven companies in the top 25. (These are the companies profiting most from war.)\n\nThe largest recipients of arms from these major exporters are a reflection of the strategic alliances of these countries. The United States' largest export partner is Saudi Arabia, a controversial long-time partner to the U.S. in the Middle East. In one 2017 deal, the Trump administration sold over $110 billion of weapons to Saudi Arabia to support its campaign to combat Houthi fighters in Yemen.\n\nJapan and Australia, the second and third largest buyers of U.S. military exports, are also key American allies. (These are the countries buying the most weapons from the U.S. government.)",

                    "body": "Main battle tank Leopard 2 A6 Version by the German Armed Forces\n\n(Stockholm, 13 March 2023) Imports of major arms by European states increased by 47 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, while the global level of international arms transfers decreased by 5.1 per cent. Arms imports fell overall in Africa (-40 per cent), the Americas (-21 per cent), Asia and Oceania (-7.5 per cent) and the Middle East (-8.8 per cent) -- but imports to East Asia and certain states in other areas of high geopolitical tension rose sharply. The United States' share of global arms exports increased from 33 to 40 per cent while Russia's fell from 22 to 16 per cent, according to new data on global arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\n'Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, faster. Strategic competition also continues elsewhere: arms imports to East Asia have increased and those to the Middle East remain at a high level.'\n\nGlobal arms exports have long been dominated by the USA and Russia (consistently the largest and second largest arms exporters for the past three decades). However, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest supplier, France, has narrowed. US arms exports increased by 14 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, and the USA accounted for 40 per cent of global arms exports in 2018-22. Russia's arms exports fell by 31 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22 per cent to 16 per cent, while France's share increased from 7.1 per cent to 11 per cent.\n\nRussian arms exports decreased to 8 of its 10 biggest recipients between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Exports to India, the largest recipient of Russian arms, fell by 37 per cent, while exports to the other 7 decreased by an average of 59 per cent. However, Russian arms exports increased to China (+39 per cent) and Egypt (+44 per cent), and they became Russia's second and third largest recipients.\n\n'It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports. This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia and increasing pressure from the USA and its allies not to buy Russian arms,' said Siemon T. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nFrance's arms exports increased by 44 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Most of these exports were to states in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East. India received 30 per cent of France's arms exports in 2018-22, and France displaced the USA as the second largest supplier of arms to India after Russia.\n\n'France is gaining a bigger share of the global arms market as Russian arms exports decline, as seen in India, for example,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'This seems likely to continue, as by the end of 2022, France had far more outstanding orders for arms exports than Russia.'\n\nFrom 1991 until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms. As a result of military aid from the USA and many European states following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine became the 3rd biggest importer of major arms during 2022 (after Qatar and India) and the 14th biggest for 2018-22. Ukraine accounted for 2.0 per cent of global arms imports in the five-year period.\n\n'Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, NATO states declined Ukraine's requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme.\n\nAsia and Oceania received 41 per cent of major arms transfers in 2018-22, a slightly smaller share than in 2013-17. Despite the overall decline in transfers to the region, there were marked increases in some states, and marked decreases in others. Six states in the region were among the 10 largest importers globally in 2018-22: India, Australia, China, South Korea, Pakistan and Japan.\n\nArms imports by East Asian states increased by 21 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. Arms imports by China rose by 4.1 per cent, with most coming from Russia. However, the biggest increases in East Asia were by US treaty allies South Korea (+61 per cent) and Japan (+171 per cent). Australia, the largest arms importer in Oceania, increased its imports by 23 per cent.\n\n'Growing perceptions of threats from China and North Korea have driven rising demand for arms imports by Japan, South Korea and Australia, notably including for long-range strike weapons,' said Siemon T. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'The main supplier for all three is the USA.'\n\nIndia remains the world's top arms importer, but its arms imports declined by 11 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22. This decline was linked to a complex procurement process, efforts to diversify arms suppliers and attempts to replace imports with local designs. Imports by Pakistan, the world's eighth largest arms importer in 2018-22, increased by 14 per cent, with China as its main supplier.\n\nThree of the top 10 importers in 2018-22 were in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt. Saudi Arabia was the world's second largest arms importer in 2018-22 and received 9.6 per cent of all arms imports in the period. Qatar's arms imports increased by 311 per cent between 2013-17 and 2018-22, making it the world's third biggest arms importer in 2018-22.\n\nThe great majority of arms imports to the Middle East came from the USA (54 per cent), followed by France (12 per cent), Russia (8.6 per cent) and Italy (8.4 per cent). They included more than 260 advanced combat aircraft, 516 new tanks and 13 frigates. Arab states in the Gulf region alone have placed orders for another more than 180 combat aircraft, while 24 have been ordered from Russia by Iran (which received virtually no major arms during 2018-22).\n\nThe SIPRI Arms Transfers Database is the only public resource that provides consistent information, often estimates, on all international transfers of major arms (including sales, gifts and production under licence) to states, international organizations and non-state groups since 1950. It is accessible on the Arms Transfers Database page of SIPRI's website. SIPRI's data reflects the volume of deliveries of arms, not the financial value of the deals. As the volume of deliveries can fluctuate significantly year-on-year, SIPRI presents data for five-year periods, giving a more stable measure of trends. This is the second of three major data launches in the lead-up to the release of SIPRI's flagship publication in mid 2023, the annual SIPRI Yearbook. The third data launch will provide comprehensive information on global, regional and national trends in military spending.",
