                    "body": "Dan Sabbagh Defence editor, Aletha Adu Political correspondent\n\nBritain is not planning to send RAF Typhoons to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said, rejecting a high profile campaign led by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with the support of the former prime minister Boris Johnson.\n\nBen Wallace said the jets would be too complex for Ukraine - but added, with the backing of Downing Street, the fighters could provide air cover for eastern bloc countries to backfill if they wanted to send their MiG-29 and other Soviet-era jets to Kyiv.\n\nThe defence secretary said: \"We're not going to send our own Typhoon jets in the short term to Ukraine,\" in an interview with Sky News to coincide with the first anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion on Friday.\n\nBut the comments deal a blow to Zelenskiy, who travelled to the UK this month to make a dramatic request for \"wings for freedom\" in a rare address by a foreign leader to both Houses of Parliament in Westminster.\n\nInstead, Wallace said that if other countries with Soviet-origin aircraft wanted to supply Ukraine instead, the UK would be willing to help provide air cover for that country to make up for the loss of jets.\n\nDowning Street said it had always believed that western jets \"wouldn't help in the immediate future given the training timelines and support systems required\" but added that RAF Typhoons could help other countries.\n\n\"The PM has previously described our willingness to help support other countries who might be able to offer their capabilities, we could help backfill for example, in a range of things they might be required to do,\" a spokesperson added.\n\nPoland has repeatedly said it is willing to supply Ukraine with its fleet of 28 MiG-29s \"as part of a wider coalition\", although at least some of the jets are thought to have been broken up and supplied to Kyiv's air force covertly as spare parts.\n\nKyiv has also called for it to be supplied with US-made F-16s, the most widely available fighter jet worldwide, and discussions between the US and Ukraine continue, despite an initial rejection of the plan by Joe Biden, the US president, in late January.\n\nRelated: Ukraine fighter pilot: I could learn to fly western jet within three months\n\nUkrainian pilots will need to be retrained to use any western fighter aircraft - with the process taking anywhere from three months, as some of Kyiv's pilots say, to six to nine months, as suggested by RAF insiders.\n\nLabour said it would support the government on whatever decision it made on fighter jets. The party leader, Keir Starmer, said: \"We are not going to politically divide on this. We will support the government in the decision that it makes.\"\n\nPart of the problem, Wallace added, was that a rapid deployment would have to involve hundreds of British ground crew having to relocate to Ukraine for support - although Ukraine hopes to train its own engineers as needed.\n\n\"Gifting a fighter jet comes with hundreds of people: engineers, pilots, training, electronic warfare. The more complicated the platform, the greater the tail,\" Wallace said, referring to the need for ground support.\n\n\"The west is not going to be putting troops into Ukraine in those scales. The idea that we would put Typhoons in - we would have to send 200 RAF people and we're not going to do that ... at this current stage,\" he added.\n\nAviation experts have questioned whether RAF Typhoons, which traditionally fly from long, clear runways, would be suitable for Ukraine, given its need to operate in rough, dispersed airstrips to prevent planes being shot down by Russia.\n\nKing Charles offered his support for Ukraine in a personal message issued on Friday. The country's people, he said, have \"suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack\" and \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy\".\n\nA minute's silence was led by Rishi Sunak at 11am outside No 10. Joined by his wife, Akshata Murthy, the prime minister paid his respects to Ukrainians killed in the fighting, along with Kyiv's ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK.\n\nJustin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said Ukraine must not be forced into a \"Munich agreement-like compromise\", referring to the failed 1938 pre-war agreement that led to the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Anglican leader, writing in the Daily Telegraph, also called for a \"just peace\" between Russia and Ukraine, and a settlement that Moscow could consider fair. \"Russia cannot end up like Germany after 1919; it must be able to recover and be secure without being allowed to repeat its aggression,\" he added.\n\nJames Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has announced an export ban on any equipment Russia is found to have used on the battlefield. The ban will mean companies cannot supply Russia with a range of items, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components.\n\nThe Foreign Office also announced new sanctions on executives at several Russian companies, including the state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, two defence companies and four banks.\n\nUkraine's president thanked Sunak and the British people for \"unwavering support\" in \"the fight against aggression\". Zelenskiy praised the prime minister for the sanctions package, and made no mention of the announcement regarding Typhoons.",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nRishi Sunak told the cabinet on Tuesday he was struck by the number of people at last weekend's Munich security conference who noted that \"UK leadership had played an important part in the global response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nFor once, it wasn't just spin. I've talked to some of the participants in Munich. They confirmed the plaudits for the UK, and said the prime minister made a good impression, describing him variously as \"serious,\" \"smart\" and \"trustworthy.\" Not everything went according to plan for Sunak. He spoke to a half-empty hall because, after she introduced him, the US vice president, Kamala Harris, departed - in her 35-car motorcade. Security staff closed the hotel entrance, so people couldn't get in to hear the PM. (There was much grumbling in the margins about the intense US security, which saw even a furious Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, caught in a 20-minute holding operation on his home soil).\n\nSunak's message went down well for those who did hear it. He told the conference the West needed to do more to boost Ukraine's long-term security, saying: \"We must give them the advanced, Nato-standard capabilities that they need for the future. And we must demonstrate that we'll remain by their side, willing and able to help them defend their country again and again.\"\n\nThe architect of Britain's prominent role on Ukraine was Boris Johnson, who displayed strong leadership after the Russian invasion. Whatever his many faults, notably his failure to uphold standards in public life, even Mr Johnson's most severe critics concede privately that his world-leading diplomatic offensive on Ukraine was his finest hour. He deserved his hero status in Ukraine itself, and in the eyes of Zelensky, who visited the UK first on his tour of Europe this month.\n\nThe unexpected war on Europe's soil allowed the UK to rebuild some bridges with the EU that had been badly burned by the vote for Brexit in 2016, and by the fraught negotiations that followed.\n\nRelations that were in the deep freeze started to thaw: officials in London and Brussels began to talk again and symbolically, Liz Truss, then as foreign secretary, even attended a meeting of her EU counterparts. Mr Johnson's stance proved to be good public relations for a UK that looked in danger of becoming isolated in the post-Brexit world. But even some Brexiteers admit that the war reminded them that the UK had more in common with their European neighbours than they often care to admit.\n\nJohnson's resolute stance was continued - albeit briefly - when Ms Truss succeeded him. Some Mr Johnson and Ms Truss allies privately worried that Mr Sunak would not be as robust, noting his scepticism while chancellor about higher defence spending. Arm-wrestling with the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, over the size of his budget continues - not least because of UK commitments to Ukraine - but the government has not wavered in its backing for Volodymyr Zelensky under Sunak.\n\nThe list of the support the UK has offered to Ukraine includes \u00a32.3 billion in military assistance - with the government having said it will match, or exceed in 2023/24 - the second-largest contribution by an individual nation after the US. When that is combined with economic and humanitarian assistance, the UK has committed billions more. When it comes to weaponry, the UK has provided anti-tank missiles, artillery, air defence systems, armoured fighting vehicles, anti-structure munitions, and three M270 long-range multiple-launch rocket systems. Britain will also provide 14 Challenger II main battle tanks. The UK has also provided more 200,000 items of non-lethal aid, including body armour, helmets, night vision equipment, medical equipment and winter clothing.\n\nWorking with other nations on broad sanctions packages against Russia, the UK has moved against 1,200 people and more than 120 businesses since Russia's invasion started.\n\nNow, Mr Johnson and Ms Truss are rattling Mr Sunak's cage by urging him to send fighter jets to Ukraine. In part, this reflects their shared desire to make life difficult for him and, in Mr Johnson's case, leave open the option of trying to make a remarkable comeback. Yet on Ukraine, the two former PMs have a strong case: the present military stalemate suits Russia more than Ukraine, which needs more western weapons now. Recent history is also on their side. As Mr Johnson told the Commons on Monday: \"The story of the last 12 months is that sooner or later, having exhausted all the other options, we give them [the Ukrainians] what they need. If that is the choice - sooner or later - we should give them [planes] sooner.\"\n\nDespite Mr Johnson's record on Ukraine, the UK's reputation on the world stage was harmed by his readiness to break international law and by the economic turmoil during Ms Truss' premiership. Mr Sunak's route to repairing the damage is to hug the US close and improve relations with the EU, with our leadership on Ukraine helping to smooth that process at points. Politicians and diplomats from Europe and the US view him as someone they can trust - a verdict helped by Mr Sunak's efforts in the wings of the Munich conference to reach a settlement with EU leaders on the Northern Ireland protocol. \"He is not exploiting the issue as Johnson did,\" an official from one EU member state said. \"Everyone can see he is working in good faith.\" Another added: \"The UK is back.\"\n\nThe UK public and political opinion has been and remains solidly behind Ukraine. On the day Mr Sunak became PM, he rang Sir Keir Starmer; the pair exchanged mobile numbers and agreed to maintain the bipartisan approach on Ukraine. This was epitomised earlier this month when Zelensky made his surprise visit to London, and an emotional speech in parliament's Westminster Hall. On the same day, there was a rare outbreak of unity between the PM and leader of the opposition at prime minister's questions, as they agreed with each other on the need to continue to supply weapons to Ukraine and to ensure the defeat of Russia.\n\nUkraine will not decide the next general election and it suits both Mr Sunak and Sir Keir to put aside the differences they have on most other issues. The relatively inexperienced PM wants to play the statesman, while the Labour leader wants to look like a PM-in-waiting. In fact, Sir Keir has the greater incentive to play it tough on Ukraine. It allows him to express Labour's solid support for Nato, helping his drive to reassure voters his party has moved on from the Jeremy Corbyn era. Mr Corbyn's initial refusal to blame Russia for the Salisbury poisonings damaged Labour at the 2019 election. The party was seen as unpatriotic by many voters in the red wall in the north and Midlands. Sir Keir has gone to the other extreme, using the Union flag as a backdrop as much as Tory ministers do.\n\nUK politicians are on safe ground because of public opinion. Britons voted with their hearts after the invasion: 152,600 Ukrainians have been issued with visas after finding a sponsor to take them into their home under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.\n\nA year on, there is little sign of public support waning. Britons are proud of the government's actions: 71 per cent think the UK has made the best response to the Ukraine crisis, according to an Opinium poll for the Policy Exchange think tank. There is some evidence that Britons are among the strongest supporters of Ukraine around the world.\n\nLike their counterparts on the continent, Britons tend to view the Ukraine crisis as a security issue, while Americans see it more as the fight to preserve democracy Joe Biden portrayed during his European tour this week.\n\nNo significant body of opinion in the UK opposes the policy on Ukraine. In contrast, some European diplomats worry that doubts on the Trumpian wing of the Republican party could have an impact on the US' leading role in the run-up to next year's presidential election.\n\nDespite the West's surprising degree of unity and resolve, divisions about the possible end game in Ukraine among EU members are visible just below the surface. The unity might not survive; France, Germany and Italy are among the potential wobblers, particularly if any negotiations between Ukraine and Russia take place. This is the giant elephant in the west's room.\n\nAlthough the UK's financial commitment is huge, the war may prove easier than the peace for our politicians too. As one former minister put it: \"There is little coherence in how the west is engaging with the war. It's all about tactics, it was about tanks, now it's air power. The bigger question - a strategy on Russia - is completely missing.\"",

                    "body": "Britons across the UK fell silent this morning to mark the first anniversary of Russia's bloody war in Ukraine.\n\nThousands observed a UK-wide minute's silence on Friday morning as they paid their respects to all those killed in the conflict.\n\nKing Charles and Rishi Sunak led tributes from Buckingham Palace and Downing Street. Former prime minister Boris Johnson - a close ally of Volodymyr Zelensky - joined a service at the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London and lit a candle.\n\nUkraine is marking one year of war on Friday, with the number of Ukrainian civilians killed as high as 100,000. Both sides have suffered tens of thousands of military casualties and millions of civilians have either been displaced or left homeless in the months since Russian tanks rolled across the border.\n\nBut Ukraine continues to stand strong as Russian president Vladimir Putin launched another offensive in the east after suffering a series of setbacks in a faltering campaign that his military strategists first believed would be finished in a matter of weeks.\n\nMr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, said in a defiant address to mark the anniversary that his people were \"invincible\" and will do everything to secure \"victory\" for their country in 2023.\n\nThe King, in his message on Friday, praised the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\n\"It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation,\" he said.\n\n\"They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy.\"\n\nHe added: \"The world has watched in horror at all the unnecessary suffering inflicted upon Ukrainians, many of whom I have had the great pleasure of meeting here in the UK and, indeed, across the world, from Romania to Canada.\n\n\"Earlier this month I met President Zelensky at Buckingham Palace to express my personal support for the people of Ukraine. It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nMr Sunak will urge his counterparts to \"move faster\" to arm Ukraine at a virtual meeting of the G7 countries later on Friday.\n\nHe also praised the country's bravery, adding that the UK and Ukraine \"stand together, stand united\" and led tributes from Downing Street.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nRishi Sunak was joined during the minute silence outside No 10 by wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the UK's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine on February 24 last year, beginning with an attempted lightning assault on the capital Kyiv.\n\nIn the year since, the UK has remained a prominent supporter of Ukraine, sending the eastern European country weapons and other supplies alongside other Western allies.\n\nParliament has been at the heart of several important events during the course of the war, with Mr Zelenksy addressing MPs and peers in Westminster Hall earlier this month, when he called on the UK to provide fighter jets to help his country's ongoing struggle.\n\nLast year, he addressed MPs in the Commons chamber via video link, and echoed Churchill's Second World War speeches.\n\nIn the early days of the war, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko received a rare standing ovation from MPs as he sat in the gallery watching a debate.\n\nMPs stood in silence in the Commons chamber to mark a year since the invasion of Ukraine began.\n\nThe one-minute silence halted Commons proceedings during a Friday sitting, when a small group of MPs usually attend to consider private member's Bills.\n\nSeveral ministers and shadow ministers joined the cohort of backbench Labour and Conservative MPs in the Commons for the occasion.\n\nDeputy Commons Speaker Dame Rosie Winterton said \"Slava Ukraini\", meaning Glory to Ukraine in Ukrainian, as the silence came to an end.\n\nAfter the national pause, the Ukrainian national anthem was sung.\n\nHundreds of people, many of them wrapped in Ukraine's blue and yellow flag national flag, braved the cold to attend a vigil at London's Trafalgar Square last night, which was coordinated by the US, UK and Ukrainian embassies.\n\nAn emotional Dame Helen Mirren called for \"peace\" and \"democracy\" for Ukraine as she recited a poem by one of the country's most celebrated writers at the event.\n\nA large screen was lit up with the phrase 'slava Ukraini' - 'glory to Ukraine' - a national salute that has become known as the battle cry of the fight-back against Moscow.\n\nVideos showed the crowds joining in as singer-songwriter Jamala Bird performed Ukrainian songs on-screen, while Ukrainian pop-rock band Antytila also performed via video link, accompanied by a live dance performance in the square.",

                    "body": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has led a minute's silence from the steps of Downing Street as the UK showed solidarity with Ukraine on the anniversary of the start of the war.\n\nStanding alongside Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, and members of the Ukrainian armed forces, Mr Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, observed the silence in front of a blue and yellow wreath on the door of Number 10 to represent the Ukrainian flag.\n\nUkrainian singers then sang the national anthem to bring the moment of reflection to a close.\n\nUkraine latest: Zelenskyy honours military at service on anniversary of war\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Mr Sunak said: \"As we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also marked the moment on a visit to Cardiff where he had met members of the Ukrainian community.\n\nHe told reporters afterwards: \"I had the privilege last week of being in Ukraine and to see first-hand the courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people, which was really humbling.\n\n\"And I think today is a day for repeating what I said to them, which is whatever other political divides there are in the UK, we stand united in our support of Ukraine. Putin must be defeated in Ukraine.\"\n\nKing Charles released a statement describing how the Ukrainian people had shown \"truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy\", adding: \"I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nAnd MPs in the Commons paused proceedings to observe the silence from the famous green benches.\n\nOther politicians, including former prime minister Boris Johnson and London mayor Sadiq Khan, attended a prayer service earlier at the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in the capital to mark the anniversary.\n\nAfter a choir of children sang, candles were lit by the congregation and pictures of those who had lost their lives in the war were shown on a screen.\n\nAnd faith leaders from across the city offered prayers for those living through the war.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Khan said: \"To those who have been forced to flee your homes, to those who have lost family and friends and to those sick with worry for loved ones in Ukraine - we cant ever know what you are going through, but know that London stands with you.\n\n\"We stand up for your rights to live free from fear, free from threats, free from intimidation, violence and terror because these are rights that are fundamental to our way of life. And we recognise Ukrainians are risking their lives, not just for the future of Ukraine, but for the future of Europe.\"\n\nMr Prystaiko also spoke to thank those who supported Ukraine, adding: \"This 24 February, this date will remain etched in our memory forever.\n\n\"It is a day when the West and the whole world finally understood what was happening and woke up to the challenge.\n\n\"You gave us reassurance that we are not alone... we are forever grateful for all of you.\"\n\nMr Johnson did not speak at the event, but received a round of applause as he left after shouting \"Salava Ukraini\" - meaning \"glory to Ukraine\".\n\nLater on Friday, Mr Sunak is expected to use a virtual G7 meeting to urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" to arm Ukraine's troops.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset,\" he is expected to say.\n\nClick to subscribe to Beth Rigby Interviews... wherever you get your podcasts\n\n\"This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are overreaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nGrant Shapps and Ukrainian refugee family describe living together\n\nThis is how many civilians have lost their lives in Ukraine over the past year\n\nUkraine has continued to appeal to the West to send fighter jets to help them in their fight.\n\nTheir appeal has been backed by former prime minister Mr Johnson, who told Sky News on Thursday that the UK needs to \"break the ice\" by becoming the first country to supply the aircraft.\n\nBut Mr Sunak and defence secretary Ben Wallace have refused the request.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, Mr Wallace said he couldn't \"rule anything in or anything out\" in the long-term.\n\nBut he added: \"We're not going to send our own typhoon jets in the in the short term to Ukraine. We've been quite clear about that.\"",

Ukraine was formally granted EU candidate status last year. \"Ukrainians have expressed their wish for a future within the EU, and we have acknowledged that by granting Ukraine the status of candidate country,\" the statement on Friday went on.\n\nEstonia: Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, speaking at a news conference with Von der Leyen and Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, praised Ukrainian courage and said that \"the free world needs to show the same courage and support to Ukraine until the last Russian soldier has left Ukraine.\"\n\nShe added: \"If we fall for Russia's threats, we will wake up in much more dangerous world.\"",

Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" he is expected to say in a virtual meeting a year on from Russia's invasion.\n\nThe UK is due to hold a minute's silence at 11:00 am (1100 GMT) to mark the first anniversary of the conflict. Sunak will join military personnel in observing the national moment of reflection at his Downing Street office, a statement said.\n\nAlongside the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, he will also host Ukrainian armed forces personnel and representatives of 10 nations supporting the government's programme to provide them with extra military training.\n\nSunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, will also hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door to his office at No 10 Downing Street, the statement added.",

                    "body": "krainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said victory \"will inevitably await us\", one year on from Russia's invasion.\n\nZelensky called on allies to \"respect their promises and deadlines\" and renewed his calls for the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to send fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\nDuring a lengthy press conference on Friday he asked a British journalist: \"Where are our Typhoon aircraft?\" and smiled as he followed up: \"Please ask my friend Rishi [Sunak]\".\n\nWhen pressed on what will happen if victory is not secured against Vladimir Putin's troops this year, he replied: \"I do not even want to think about it.\n\n\"We are partners. We have to be together. We will win.\"\n\nHe added: \"I really want every single partner to remain strong, to remain united for our victory, because that is going to be a victory of values.\n\n\"I am confident that we will have this victory soon. We have everything to have it this year.\"\n\nZelensky's reflections came as Rishi Sunak agreed with G7 leaders to intensify military aid for Ukraine's armed forces.\n\nIn a statement after meeting virtually they pledged to deepen sanctions against those aiding Russia's war effort.\n\nSeparately, Washington announced $2 billion in additional aid and released details of new measures it was taking that not only targeted Russia but also \"third-country actors\" across Europe, Asia and the Middle East supporting Russia's war machine.\n\nBritain also issued more sanctions against Russia, including export bans on every item it has used on the battlefield and import bans on iron and steel goods.\n\nEarlier, the PM led the UK in a minute's silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the war, as the world reflected on the conflict initiated by Putin's full-scale invasion last February.\n\nOutside No 10 on Friday morning, Sunak had been joined by his wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King also issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nDuring his two-and-a-half hour press conference, Zelensky told how the worst moment since war began was the Bucha massacre last March, when hundreds of civilians were slaughtered by Putin's troops.\n\n\"What I saw there. The moment we de-occupied Bucha, it was horrible. What we have seen - the devil is among us,\" he told journalists.\n\nAsked about whether Putin might face a war crimes tribunal, the Ukrainian leader says he believes both the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014 and the war would play a key roles in any prosecution.\n\nHe also said it was conceivable Russia might invade another country and used Moldova as an example amid recent fears of a leadership change.\n\nZelensky became emotional when quizzed about how he and his family are coping personally.\n\n\"I love my family,\" he said. \"I love my wife. My children are the most important people for me. I do not get to see them often.\n\n\"I don't have any opportunities to see my parents.\n\n\"I am very proud of my wife. I know what kind of person she is and I know that she is doing everything she can for the sake of the children and the country. They are all in my heart. I was honest with you when I said this was the hardest question.\"\n\nSunak and his fellow world leaders have pledged to stand with Ukraine for as long as needed after war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced.\n\nA call on Friday afternoon saw Sunak join fellow leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to discuss the war effort and how best to support Ukraine going forward.\n\nIn a joint statement, G7 leaders committed to intensifying \"diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine\" as well as \"increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort\".\n\nThey also pledged that \"solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law\".\n\nAccording to a Downing Street readout, Sunak urged allies to \"support Ukraine with long-term military and security assurances to send a strong message to Putin that the global support was enduring\".\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian president.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian president will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nCharles, who hosted Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nFormer Labour leader Sir Tony Blair lent his support to calls for Ukraine to receive the much-desired jets.",

                    "body": "Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said victory \"will inevitably await us\", one year on from Russia's invasion.\n\nZelensky called on allies to \"respect their promises and deadlines\" and renewed his calls for the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to send fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\nDuring a lengthy press conference on Friday he asked a British journalist: \"Where are our Typhoon aircraft?\" and smiled as he followed up: \"Please ask my friend Rishi [Sunak]\".\n\nWhen pressed on what will happen if victory is not secured against Vladimir Putin's troops this year, he replied: \"I do not even want to think about it.\n\n\"We are partners. We have to be together. We will win.\"\n\nHe added: \"I really want every single partner to remain strong, to remain united for our victory, because that is going to be a victory of values.\n\n\"I am confident that we will have this victory soon. We have everything to have it this year.\"\n\nZelensky's reflections came as Rishi Sunak agreed with G7 leaders to intensify military aid for Ukraine's armed forces.\n\nIn a statement after meeting virtually they pledged to deepen sanctions against those aiding Russia's war effort.\n\nSeparately, Washington announced $2 billion in additional aid and released details of new measures it was taking that not only targeted Russia but also \"third-country actors\" across Europe, Asia and the Middle East supporting Russia's war machine.\n\nBritain also issued more sanctions against Russia, including export bans on every item it has used on the battlefield and import bans on iron and steel goods.\n\nEarlier, the PM led the UK in a minute's silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the war, as the world reflected on the conflict initiated by Putin's full-scale invasion last February.\n\nOutside No 10 on Friday morning, Sunak had been joined by his wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King also issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nDuring his two-and-a-half hour press conference, Zelensky told how the worst moment since war began was the Bucha massacre last March, when hundreds of civilians were slaughtered by Putin's troops.\n\n\"What I saw there. The moment we de-occupied Bucha, it was horrible. What we have seen - the devil is among us,\" he told journalists.\n\nAsked about whether Putin might face a war crimes tribunal, the Ukrainian leader says he believes both the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014 and the war would play a key roles in any prosecution.\n\nHe also said it was conceivable Russia might invade another country and used Moldova as an example amid recent fears of a leadership change.\n\nZelensky became emotional when quizzed about how he and his family are coping personally.\n\n\"I love my family,\" he said. \"I love my wife. My children are the most important people for me. I do not get to see them often.\n\n\"I don't have any opportunities to see my parents.\n\n\"I am very proud of my wife. I know what kind of person she is and I know that she is doing everything she can for the sake of the children and the country. They are all in my heart. I was honest with you when I said this was the hardest question.\"\n\nSunak and his fellow world leaders have pledged to stand with Ukraine for as long as needed after war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced.\n\nA call on Friday afternoon saw Sunak join fellow leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to discuss the war effort and how best to support Ukraine going forward.\n\nIn a joint statement, G7 leaders committed to intensifying \"diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine\" as well as \"increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort\".\n\nThey also pledged that \"solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law\".\n\nAccording to a Downing Street readout, Sunak urged allies to \"support Ukraine with long-term military and security assurances to send a strong message to Putin that the global support was enduring\".\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian president.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian president will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nCharles, who hosted Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nFormer Labour leader Sir Tony Blair lent his support to calls for Ukraine to receive the much-desired jets.",

                    "body": "Rishi Sunak and his fellow world leaders have pledged to stand with Ukraine for as long as needed, after a year of war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced.\n\nEarlier, the Prime Minister led the UK in a minute's silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the war, as the world reflected on the conflict initiated by Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion last February.\n\nA call on Friday afternoon saw Mr Sunak join fellow leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to discuss the war effort and how best to support Ukraine going forward.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nIn a joint statement, G7 leaders committed to intensifying \"diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine\" as well as \"increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort\".\n\nThey also pledged that \"solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law\".\n\nAccording to a Downing Street readout, Mr Sunak urged allies to \"support Ukraine with long-term military and security assurances to send a strong message to President Putin that the global support was enduring\".\n\nOutside No 10 on Friday morning, the Prime Minister had been joined by his wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King also issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by President Volodymyr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian president.\n\nA part-destroyed business tower in Kyiv, ahead of the first anniversary (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian president will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nAddressing the UN Security Council in New York, Mr Cleverly said that Mr Putin would attempt to intimidate Ukraine's allies in his bid for \"imperial expansion\", as the conflict drags on.\n\nHe added: \"His land grabs in eastern and southern Ukraine show us that his heart is set on imperial expansion. But 800 Russian soldiers a day are dying for his hopeless ambitions.\n\n\"They are paying for his ego with their lives. As he sees that his aggression against Ukraine is failing, we should expect him to try and strongarm us into backing down with every dirty, coercive instrument at his disposal.\"\n\nSome 461 paper angels, one for each child that has died in the past year according to official statistics, hang from the roof of the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London (Yui Mok/PA)\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nUkrainian troops and their UK military instructors (Gareth Fuller/PA)\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\nFormer Labour leader Sir Tony Blair lent his support to calls for Ukraine to receive the much-desired jets.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that \"if that's what Ukraine needs\" then support should include jets.\n\nHe added: \"They have to be given what is necessary for them to defend themselves. But the single biggest thing they are going to need is munitions and artillery.\"",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nRishi Sunak and his fellow world leaders have pledged to stand with Ukraine for as long as needed, after a year of war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced.\n\nEarlier, the Prime Minister led the UK in a minute's silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the war, as the world reflected on the conflict initiated by Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion last February.\n\nA call on Friday afternoon saw Mr Sunak join fellow leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to discuss the war effort and how best to support Ukraine going forward.\n\nIn a joint statement, G7 leaders committed to intensifying \"diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine\" as well as \"increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort\".\n\nThey also pledged that \"solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law\".\n\nAccording to a Downing Street readout, Mr Sunak urged allies to \"support Ukraine with long-term military and security assurances to send a strong message to President Putin that the global support was enduring\".\n\nOutside No 10 on Friday morning, the Prime Minister had been joined by his wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King also issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by President Volodymyr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian president.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian president will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nAddressing the UN Security Council in New York, Mr Cleverly said that Mr Putin would attempt to intimidate Ukraine's allies in his bid for \"imperial expansion\", as the conflict drags on.\n\nHe added: \"His land grabs in eastern and southern Ukraine show us that his heart is set on imperial expansion. But 800 Russian soldiers a day are dying for his hopeless ambitions.\n\n\"They are paying for his ego with their lives. As he sees that his aggression against Ukraine is failing, we should expect him to try and strongarm us into backing down with every dirty, coercive instrument at his disposal.\"\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\nFormer Labour leader Sir Tony Blair lent his support to calls for Ukraine to receive the much-desired jets.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that \"if that's what Ukraine needs\" then support should include jets.\n\nHe added: \"They have to be given what is necessary for them to defend themselves. But the single biggest thing they are going to need is munitions and artillery.\"",

                    "body": "Earlier the Prime Minister led the UK in a minute's silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the war.\n\nRishi Sunak and his fellow world leaders have pledged to stand with Ukraine for as long as needed, after a year of war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced.\n\nEarlier, the Prime Minister led the UK in a minute's silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the war, as the world reflected on the conflict initiated by Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion last February.\n\nA call on Friday afternoon saw Mr Sunak join fellow leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to discuss the war effort and how best to support Ukraine going forward.\n\nThey also pledged that \"solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law\".\n\nAccording to a Downing Street readout, Mr Sunak urged allies to \"support Ukraine with long-term military and security assurances to send a strong message to President Putin that the global support was enduring\".\n\nOutside No 10 on Friday morning, the Prime Minister had been joined by his wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King also issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by President Volodymyr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian president.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian president will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nAddressing the UN Security Council in New York, Mr Cleverly said that Mr Putin would attempt to intimidate Ukraine's allies in his bid for \"imperial expansion\", as the conflict drags on.\n\nHe added: \"His land grabs in eastern and southern Ukraine show us that his heart is set on imperial expansion. But 800 Russian soldiers a day are dying for his hopeless ambitions.\n\n\"They are paying for his ego with their lives. As he sees that his aggression against Ukraine is failing, we should expect him to try and strongarm us into backing down with every dirty, coercive instrument at his disposal.\"\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\nFormer Labour leader Sir Tony Blair lent his support to calls for Ukraine to receive the much-desired jets.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that \"if that's what Ukraine needs\" then support should include jets.\n\nHe added: \"They have to be given what is necessary for them to defend themselves. But the single biggest thing they are going to need is munitions and artillery.\"",

                    "body": "Dominic McGrath, Sam Blewett and Gavin Cordon, PA Political Staff\n\nRishi Sunak and his fellow world leaders have pledged to stand with Ukraine for as long as needed, after a year of war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced.\n\nEarlier, the Prime Minister led the UK in a minute's silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the war, as the world reflected on the conflict initiated by Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion last February.\n\nA call on Friday afternoon saw Mr Sunak join fellow leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to discuss the war effort and how best to support Ukraine going forward.\n\nIn a joint statement, G7 leaders committed to intensifying \"diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine\" as well as \"increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort\".\n\nThey also pledged that \"solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law\".\n\nAccording to a Downing Street readout, Mr Sunak urged allies to \"support Ukraine with long-term military and security assurances to send a strong message to President Putin that the global support was enduring\".\n\nOutside No 10 on Friday morning, the Prime Minister had been joined by his wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King also issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by President Volodymyr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian president.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian president will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nAddressing the UN Security Council in New York, Mr Cleverly said that Mr Putin would attempt to intimidate Ukraine's allies in his bid for \"imperial expansion\", as the conflict drags on.\n\nHe added: \"His land grabs in eastern and southern Ukraine show us that his heart is set on imperial expansion. But 800 Russian soldiers a day are dying for his hopeless ambitions.\n\n\"They are paying for his ego with their lives. As he sees that his aggression against Ukraine is failing, we should expect him to try and strongarm us into backing down with every dirty, coercive instrument at his disposal.\"\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\nFormer Labour leader Sir Tony Blair lent his support to calls for Ukraine to receive the much-desired jets.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that \"if that's what Ukraine needs\" then support should include jets.\n\nHe added: \"They have to be given what is necessary for them to defend themselves. But the single biggest thing they are going to need is munitions and artillery.\"",

                    "body": "ishi Sunak and his fellow world leaders have pledged to stand with Ukraine for as long as needed, after a year of war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced.\n\nEarlier, the Prime Minister led the UK in a minute's silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the war, as the world reflected on the conflict initiated by Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion last February.\n\nA call on Friday afternoon saw Mr Sunak join fellow leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to discuss the war effort and how best to support Ukraine going forward.\n\nIn a joint statement, G7 leaders committed to intensifying \"diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine\" as well as \"increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort\".\n\nThey also pledged that \"solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law\".\n\nAccording to a Downing Street readout, Mr Sunak urged allies to \"support Ukraine with long-term military and security assurances to send a strong message to President Putin that the global support was enduring\".\n\nOutside No 10 on Friday morning, the Prime Minister had been joined by his wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King also issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by President Volodymyr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian president.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian president will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nAddressing the UN Security Council in New York, Mr Cleverly said that Mr Putin would attempt to intimidate Ukraine's allies in his bid for \"imperial expansion\", as the conflict drags on.\n\nHe added: \"His land grabs in eastern and southern Ukraine show us that his heart is set on imperial expansion. But 800 Russian soldiers a day are dying for his hopeless ambitions.\n\n\"They are paying for his ego with their lives. As he sees that his aggression against Ukraine is failing, we should expect him to try and strongarm us into backing down with every dirty, coercive instrument at his disposal.\"\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\nFormer Labour leader Sir Tony Blair lent his support to calls for Ukraine to receive the much-desired jets.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that \"if that's what Ukraine needs\" then support should include jets.\n\nHe added: \"They have to be given what is necessary for them to defend themselves. But the single biggest thing they are going to need is munitions and artillery.\"",

                    "body": "Rishi Sunak is to urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" to arm Ukraine's troops as he leads a minute's silence on the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.\n\nThe prime minister is expected to use a G7 meeting today to call on allies to supply longer-range weapons to Ukraine as there is an urgent need for Kyiv to gain a \"decisive advantage\" on the battlefield.\n\nMr Sunak will lead the UK in a minute's silence at 11am to mark the anniversary on Downing Street's doorstep.\n\nHe will be joined by the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and representatives from each of the 11 nations that are part of the British-led Ukrainian troop training programme, Operation Interflex.\n\nUN demands Russia withdraw troops - Ukraine war latest\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell G7 leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are overreaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nMr Sunak will also reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine as he and his wife, Akshata Murty, hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of Number 10.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on Western countries to send fighter jets to Ukraine - and while the UK has announced training for Ukrainian pilots on NATO-standard jets, it has not sent any planes.\n\nFormer PM Boris Johnson has joined those calls and told Sky News on Thursday the UK needs to \"break the ice\" by becoming the first country to supply Ukraine with the aircraft.\n\nBut so far, neither Mr Sunak or Defence secretary Ben Wallace have not made a steadfast commitment to do so.\n\nSky News exclusively reported on Thursday the Treasury has signalled there is no new money for defence, despite recognising the urgent need to rearm in the wake of the war.\n\nAs things stand, the British army would run out of ammunition within a few days if called upon to fight and would take up to 10 years to field a modern warfighting division of some 25,000 to 30,000 troops.\n\nRead more:\n\nMatter of time before Putin is on trial for war crimes, US envoy says\n\nThis is how many civilians have lost their lives in Ukraine war\n\nRussia's economy has weathered the West's sanctions - but how?\n\nFrom Paddington 2 to president - what voters think of Zelenskyy\n\nOn the eve of the anniversary, Mr Sunak said: \"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict.\n\n\"As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nLater today, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will tell the UN Security Council that Ukraine's allies will support the country for \"as long as it takes\".\n\nSpeaking at a special session, he is expected to say: \"One year into this terrible war, let us send this clear message: our support for Ukraine is not, and will never be, time-limited.\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who met Mr Zelenskyy in Kyiv recently, said the UK's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nHe said his party stands \"in lockstep with the government\" in continuing support to Ukraine \"regardless of what other political disagreements we may have\".",

                    "body": "year of Ukraine's extraordinary resistance to Vladimir Putin's all-out assault that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced has been marked with a minute's silence.\n\nRishi Sunak was joined outside No 10 by wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister will use a call with G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to \"move faster\" in arming Volodymyr Zelensky's resistance against the invasion.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by Mr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian President.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\n\"It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin,\" he told Times Radio.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian President will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nAddressing the UN Security Council in New York, Mr Cleverly said that Mr Putin would attempt to intimidate Ukraine's allies in his bid for \"imperial expansion\", as the conflict drags on.\n\n\"His land grabs in eastern and southern Ukraine show us that his heart is set on imperial expansion. But 800 Russian soldiers a day are dying for his hopeless ambitions.\n\n\"They are paying for his ego with their lives. As he sees that his aggression against Ukraine is failing, we should expect him to try and strongarm us into backing down with every dirty, coercive instrument at his disposal.\"\n\n\"One year on, one year into this terrible, terrible war, let us in this chamber send a clear message. Our support for Ukraine is not and will never be time-limited. Our defence of the UN Charter is not and will never be time-limited.\"\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nMr Sunak will use the virtual G7 meeting to urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the conflict is stuck in a bloody stalemate.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence,\" Mr Sunak was expected to say.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nMr Sunak is expected to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

Your help in these difficult times is invaluable.\n\n'The new package of sanctions against the Russian Federation announced today is evidence of steadfast solidarity. Let's put pressure on the Russian Federation together. We will definitely win!'\n\nSunak today joined Ukraine's ambassador and some Ukrainian soldiers being trained in the United Kingdom outside Downing Street for a minute's silence in commemoration of those killed in the war.\n\nMeanwhile, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Britain is prepared to supply fighter jets to eastern European allies to enable them to release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nWallace said back-filling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nBritain are set to train Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian President.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio: 'The other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result.'\n\n'They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,' he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering 'huge losses' on the battlefield for very little territorial gain and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\n'It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin,' he told Times Radio.\n\n'That's why we see huge losses amongst the Russian army and only gains - where we see gains - in metres not miles.'\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attends memorial service for those killed and injured since beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war on the first anniversary in Kyiv, Ukraine on February 24\n\nUkrainians attend a tactical training and evacuation of injured people during military training organised by the Ukrainian political organisation 'Right Sector', in the Lviv region, western Ukraine, on Friday\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nMr Cleverly warned Mr Putin will 'probably threaten nuclear use' as he fails in Ukraine.\n\n'We have committed to ensure that Putin fails in his attempt to invade Ukraine and as that realisation of his failure dawns on him, he will use every trick in the book,' he told Times Radio.\n\n'He will use cyber, he will use disinformation, he will try and call in any and every favour in the international community that he can.\n\n'He will threaten escalation and he will probably threaten nuclear use. What we have to say to the Russian people is that there is not and has never been a threat to Russia itself.\n\n'This is a purely defensive posture. No one else is talking about this kind of escalation and there is no threat to Russia itself.'\n\nUkrainian troops and their UK military instructors mark one year since the start of the war at Lydd army camp in Kent\n\nLater, Sunak will use a call with G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to urge allies to 'move faster' in arming Zelensky's resistance against the invasion.\n\nOver the last year, the UK has been among the most vocal supporters of Ukraine's efforts to push back the Kremlin's troops, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nMr Sunak said 14 Challenger 2 tanks will be supplied, with the war machines set to arrive in eastern Europe next month.\n\nUkraine has over the last 12 months benefited from a broad coalition of support led by the US, UK and a host of European states amid international condemnation of Russia's invasion.\n\nWashington is sending 31 of its fast-moving M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, while Berlin will initially supply at least 14 Leopard 2 tanks and give permission to other NATO countries - including Poland, Norway, Finland and Spain - to deliver their own to Kyiv.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, visiting Kyiv, said a first batch of four German Leopard tanks - among scores promised - were already in Ukraine.\n\nThe prime minister said Poland will provide more Leopard tanks soon, as well as a number of upgraded, Soviet-era T-72 tanks.\n\nMeanwhile, Sweden on Friday said it would send around 10 Leopard 2 tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.",

                    "body": "King Charles says \"the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably\" in a message marking the first anniversary of Russia's invasion.\n\nHe also praised the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people after thousands have been killed and injured in the conflict.\n\nA minute's silence was held in the UK at 11:00 GMT.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak will also urge allies to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine, at a meeting of the G7 later.\n\nUkrainian troops who are being trained in the UK took part in the minute's silence outside No 10 Downing Street.\n\nMr Sunak was also joined by his wife Akshata Murthy and Kyiv's ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko.\n\nAfter the moment of commemoration the Ukrainian national anthem was sung.\n\nIn his message, King Charles said: \"It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation.\n\n\"They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy.\n\n\"The world has watched in horror at all the unnecessary suffering inflicted upon Ukrainians, many of whom I have had the great pleasure of meeting here in the UK and, indeed, across the world, from Romania to Canada.\"\n\nKing Charles, who met Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace this month, added: \"I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\n\nAt a vigil on Thursday evening, a crowd listened to an emotional reading of the Ukrainian poem Take Only What Is Most Important by actress Dame Helen Mirren - who was visibly moved to tears.\n\nAnd Defence Secretary Ben Wallace paid tribute to Ukrainian soldiers as the \"bravest of the brave\".\n\nThe conflict, which began when Russia invaded on 24 February 2022, has seen at least 100,000 of each side's soldiers killed or injured, according to the US military.\n\nThousands of civilians have also died, with more than 13 million people made refugees or displaced within Ukraine.\n\nRita and her four children were among those who fled in the early stages of the conflict. They are now living in the UK with Rita's British partner, Andy.\n\nShe told BBC Two's Newsnight programme she would \"never forget\" the \"horrible sound, that panic, that fear\" when Russian troops invaded.\n\nRita said her heart was \"aching\" after witnessing how parts of Ukraine had changed after 12 months of conflict.\n\n\"The country is in pain,\" she said. \"I know how my country is and how it can be, I know how beautiful it is. Now it's different [but] it can come back to that beautiful place.\n\n\"I can see summer time - it is going to be warm, it's going to be green. That's how I see Ukraine - with lots of green trees with lots of flowers... with lots of smiles on people's face and with tears from happiness.\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury called for peace between Russia and Ukraine as he reflected on the anniversary.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Thought of the Day segment, Justin Welby said: \"There must be a future with a just and stable peace - a free and secure Ukraine - and the beginning of a generation's long process of healing and reconciliation.\"\n\nThe British Ambassador to Ukraine, Dame Melinda Simmons, has recalled how the outbreak of the war last February was \"such a traumatic time\" for her and her colleagues, due to the uncertainty of what was ahead.\n\nShe went on to describe how her role became different, saying it stopped being a job and became \"a life because war isn't just a five day thing\".\n\nDame Melinda told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme: \"We often talk about how sirens can make your hand shake, heart beat faster, even sounds that aren't sounds like motorbikes on the road can make you start, but none of us talk about it as an active fear... we factor it in to our daily work and we are deliberate in keeping calm and carrying on.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has announced fresh export bans on goods that could be used by the Russian military.\n\nForeign Secretary James Cleverly said sanctions have been extended to more products, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components.\n\nSenior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks will also face sanctions.\n\nUkraine has been urging its Western backers to increase support, as Russia mobilises ahead of an expected spring offensive.\n\nDuring a recent tour of Europe, President Zelensky increased his calls for Western nations to supply modern fighter jets.\n\nThe UK is to start training Ukrainian forces to fly Nato-standard aircraft. But like other Western nations, it has so far not supplied jets, saying it remains a long-term option.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK would be \"very happy\" to supply fighter jets to eastern European allies so they could release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine. He said they were already being used by Kyiv and it would be a faster way of boosting Ukraine defences than suppling British Typhoons.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"That is definitely on offer, let's put it that way. If a country approaches us and says they would like us to do that, then the UK would be very happy to either backfill or indeed cover with things like extra deployment of our aircraft to cover for policing and extra protection.\"\n\n\"That's already been happening for the last eight or nine months in other countries across Europe,\" Mr Wallace added.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting of leaders from the G7 group of advanced economies, Mr Sunak is expected to say an acceleration in support for Ukraine is \"what it will take to shift Putin's mindset\".\n\n\"This must be our priority now,\" he will add. \"Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\"\n\nHe is expected to make the argument for supplying Ukraine with \"longer-range weapons\" to disrupt Russia's ability to target Ukraine's infrastructure, something to which he committed the UK earlier this month.\n\nOther senior UK politicians have sent messages to Ukraine on the anniversary of the war:\n\nAlthough support for Ukraine has united the UK's main political parties, the prime minister has faced pressure from some of his own Conservative MPs to supply fighter planes as soon as possible.",

                    "body": "London: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak led the UK in a \"national moment of reflection\" joined by wife Akshata Murty, as the first couple hung a blue and yellow wreath in the colours of the Ukrainian flag on the door of 10 Downing Street on Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe British Indian leader was accompanied by military personnel in Downing Street for the one-minute national silence at 11 am GMT to pay tribute to the \"bravery and courage\" of the Ukrainians who have been fighting on the frontlines since the conflict began on February 24 last year.\n\nAlongside the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, Sunak hosted members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as well as representatives from the 10 nations supporting the government's Interflex training programme in support of Ukraine.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" said Sunak.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe,\" he said.\n\nOperation Interflex is a British-led multinational training programme for the Ukrainian armed forces involving New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland.\n\nKing Charles III also issued a statement from Buckingham Palace condemning the \"unprovoked\" attack and expressed hope the outpouring of solidarity may bring not only practical aid but also strength from the \"knowledge that, together, we stand united\".\n\n\"It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy,\" said King Charles.\n\nEarlier this month, Sunak had raised the possibility of adding longer-range weapons to the programme with President Volodymyr Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK.\n\nOn Friday, the British Prime Minister is set to raise the issue with G7 allies including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US in a virtual meeting as he calls on international partners to help Ukraine push back Russian forces.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war and to accelerate that day they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift [Russian President] Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Sunak is due to say in his address.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward,\" he will say, according to excerpts of his speech released by Downing Street.\n\nSunak's central message to the world leaders will be that sophisticated western capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and preserve the frontline defences.\n\nHe is also expected to reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine to help in the immediate conflict.\n\nDowning Street said the capability step change underlines Sunak's push to help Ukraine seize a window of opportunity to push back Russian forces and help Ukraine defend and regain territory for the long term.",

                    "body": "The British Indian leader was accompanied by military personnel in Downing Street for the one-minute national silence at 11 am GMT.\n\nUK PM Rishi Sunak also led a minute of silence. (File)\n\nLondon:\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak led the UK in a \"national moment of reflection\" joined by wife Akshata Murty, as the first couple hung a blue and yellow wreath in the colours of the Ukrainian flag on the door of 10 Downing Street on Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe British Indian leader was accompanied by military personnel in Downing Street for the one-minute national silence at 11 am GMT to pay tribute to the \"bravery and courage\" of the Ukrainians who have been fighting on the frontlines since the conflict began on February 24 last year.\n\nAlongside the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, Sunak hosted members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as well as representatives from the 10 nations supporting the government's Interflex training programme in support of Ukraine.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" said Sunak.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe,\" he said.\n\nOperation Interflex is a British-led multinational training programme for the Ukrainian armed forces involving New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland.\n\nKing Charles III also issued a statement from Buckingham Palace condemning the \"unprovoked\" attack and expressed hope the outpouring of solidarity may bring not only practical aid but also strength from the \"knowledge that, together, we stand united\".\n\n\"It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy,\" said King Charles.\n\nEarlier this month, Sunak had raised the possibility of adding longer-range weapons to the programme with President Volodymyr Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK.\n\nOn Friday, the British Prime Minister is set to raise the issue with G7 allies - including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - in a virtual meeting as he calls on international partners to help Ukraine push back Russian forces.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift [Russian President] Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Sunak is due to say in his address.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again.

                    "body": "The silence at 11am was part of a series of moments to mark 12 months since the start of the war.\n\nKing Charles issued a message to mark the milestone, saying: \"It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy.\n\n\"The world has watched in horror at all the unnecessary suffering inflicted upon Ukrainians, many of whom I have had the great pleasure of meeting here in the UK and, indeed, across the world, from Romania to Canada.\n\n\"Earlier this month I met President Zelensky at Buckingham Palace to express my personal support for the people of Ukraine. It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak led a moment of national reflection to commemorate the anniversary. Hailing the bravery of Ukraine's people who have confounded international expectations by holding out against the Russian onslaught, the Prime Minister urged Western allies to step up military support for Kyiv.\n\nJoined by Ukrainian ambassador Vadym Prystaiko and members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street, Mr Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty showed solidarity with Ukraine by hanging a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No10.\n\nThe UK is the second largest donor of military equipment to Ukraine, having provided \u00a32.3 billion of military support to Kyiv since the war started. It has pledged to match that amount in 2023. The Prime Minister said: \"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict.\n\n\"As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nHis comments came as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK could be prepared to help meet Ukraine's plea for fighter jets by backfilling Western allies like Poland with UK planes.\n\nHe told Times Radio: \"So the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian or Soviet fighter jets and MIG 29s or SU 24s, if they wish to donate we could use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result.\"\n\nIn a further show of support for Ukraine, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced another package of sanctions against Russia, including export bans on hundreds of goods like aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that could help Russia's military.\n\nMayor Sadiq Khan was joined by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other London political figures for a church service at the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Duke's Street, Mayfair.\n\nSpeaking at the service, Mr Khan said London would not forget Ukraine... \"Londoners understand a threat to your democracy is a threat to our democracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was in Cardiff to meet members of Ukrainian communities and Ukrainian troops and UK instructors held a sunrise service at Lydd army camp in Kent, and at Westminster Abbey this evening a special service will be held.",

                    "body": "London, Feb 24 (PTI) Prime Minister Rishi Sunak led the UK in a \"national moment of reflection\" joined by wife Akshata Murty, as the first couple hung a blue and yellow wreath in the colours of the Ukrainian flag on the door of 10 Downing Street on Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe British Indian leader was accompanied by military personnel in Downing Street for the one-minute national silence at 11 am GMT to pay tribute to the \"bravery and courage\" of the Ukrainians who have been fighting on the frontlines since the conflict began on February 24 last year.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War Anniversary: G7 Leaders to Establish Enforcement Coordination Mechanism Against Russia, Says White House.\n\nAlongside the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, Sunak hosted members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as well as representatives from the 10 nations supporting the government's Interflex training programme in support of Ukraine.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" said Sunak.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: UK PM Rishi Sunak To Call on G7 Nations To Help Ukraine Amid Ongoing Conflict.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe,\" he said.\n\nOperation Interflex is a British-led multinational training programme for the Ukrainian armed forces involving New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland.\n\nKing Charles III also issued a statement from Buckingham Palace condemning the \"unprovoked\" attack and expressed hope the outpouring of solidarity may bring not only practical aid but also strength from the \"knowledge that, together, we stand united\".\n\n\"It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy,\" said King Charles.\n\nEarlier this month, Sunak had raised the possibility of adding longer-range weapons to the programme with President Volodymyr Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK.\n\nOn Friday, the British Prime Minister is set to raise the issue with G7 allies - including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - in a virtual meeting as he calls on international partners to help Ukraine push back Russian forces.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift [Russian President] Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Sunak is due to say in his address.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward,\" he will say, according to excerpts of his speech released by Downing Street.\n\nSunak's central message to the world leaders will be that sophisticated western capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and preserve the frontline defences.\n\nHe is also expected to reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine to help in the immediate conflict.\n\nDowning Street said the capability step change underlines Sunak's push to help Ukraine seize a window of opportunity to push back Russian forces and help Ukraine defend and regain territory for the long term.",

                    "body": "Alongside the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, Sunak hosted members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as well as representatives from the 10 nations supporting the governments Interflex training programme in support of Ukraine.As we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country, said Sunak.I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak led the UK in a ''national moment of reflection'' joined by wife Akshata Murty, as the first couple hung a blue and yellow wreath in the colours of the Ukrainian flag on the door of 10 Downing Street on Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe British Indian leader was accompanied by military personnel in Downing Street for the one-minute national silence at 11 am GMT to pay tribute to the ''bravery and courage'' of the Ukrainians who have been fighting on the frontlines since the conflict began on February 24 last year. Alongside the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, Sunak hosted members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as well as representatives from the 10 nations supporting the government's Interflex training programme in support of Ukraine.\n\n''As we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,'' said Sunak.\n\n''I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe,'' he said.\n\nOperation Interflex is a British-led multinational training programme for the Ukrainian armed forces involving New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland. King Charles III also issued a statement from Buckingham Palace condemning the ''unprovoked'' attack and expressed hope the outpouring of solidarity may bring not only practical aid but also strength from the ''knowledge that, together, we stand united''. ''It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy,'' said King Charles.\n\nEarlier this month, Sunak had raised the possibility of adding longer-range weapons to the programme with President Volodymyr Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK. On Friday, the British Prime Minister is set to raise the issue with G7 allies - including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - in a virtual meeting as he calls on international partners to help Ukraine push back Russian forces.\n\n''For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift [Russian President] Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,'' Sunak is due to say in his address.\n\n''The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward,'' he will say, according to excerpts of his speech released by Downing Street.\n\nSunak's central message to the world leaders will be that sophisticated western capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and preserve the frontline defences. He is also expected to reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine to help in the immediate conflict.\n\nDowning Street said the capability step change underlines Sunak's push to help Ukraine seize a window of opportunity to push back Russian forces and help Ukraine defend and regain territory for the long term.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "A tweet showing two images of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky side by sideshow how much he has changed as the war has progressed.\n\nIt has been one year since Russia invaded Ukraine, and in that time the country's president has dealt with multiple assassination attempts, negotiated with European leaders to provide safe passage for refugees, and asked for more intervention including a no-fly zone, and for Russia to be hit with more sanctions.\n\nWhen the conflict started, Zelensky said he intended to stay in the country and help and he has done.\n\nSign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter\n\nSpeaking on the anniversary, Zelensky said: \"A year ago on this day, from this same place around seven in the morning, I addressed you with a brief statement, lasting only 67 seconds,\" the president said in an early morning address, recalling his dawn speech delivered as bombs fell across Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\n\n\"Two of the most important things both then and now echoed . . . The fact that Russia started a full-scale war against us. And that we are strong. We are ready for anything. We will defeat everyone. Because we are Ukraine!\"\n\nTake a look at it the images of him changing from just the first 41 days of the war:\n\nIn the UK Rishi Sunak has led a minute's silence from Downing Street to mark a year of Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion.\n\nThe Prime Minister was joined outside No 10 by wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK.\n\nAfter the national pause, the Ukrainian national anthem was sung.\n\nAdditional reporting from PA.\n\nThe Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015. Now, as we renew our campaign and launch this petition in the wake of the unfolding Ukrainian crisis, we are calling on the government to go further and faster to ensure help is delivered.",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA year of Ukraine's extraordinary resistance to Vladimir Putin's all-out assault that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced has been marked with a minute's silence.\n\nRishi Sunak was joined outside No 10 by wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister will use a call with G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to \"move faster\" in arming Volodymyr Zelensky's resistance against the invasion.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by Mr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian President.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\n\"It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin,\" he told Times Radio.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian President will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nMr Cleverly told Times Radio: \"We have committed to ensure that Putin fails in his attempt to invade Ukraine and as that realisation of his failure dawns on him, he will use every trick in the book.\n\n\"He will threaten escalation and he will probably threaten nuclear use. What we have to say to the Russian people is that there is not and has never been a threat to Russia itself.\n\n\"This is a purely defensive posture. No one else is talking about this kind of escalation and there is no threat to Russia itself.\"\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nMr Sunak will use the virtual G7 meeting to urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the conflict is stuck in a bloody stalemate.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence,\" Mr Sunak was expected to say.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nMr Sunak is expected to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

                    "body": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set to call on partners to increase Ukraine's capability to stop Russian forces.\n\nThe Prime Minister will call on international partners to help Ukraine degrade Russian forces beyond the front lines of the conflict in a G7 meeting today (Friday).\n\nLauding the strength and resolve of the international community in supporting Ukraine, as demonstrated by the G7, the Prime Minister will make the case for longer range weapons to be supplied to their armed forces.\n\nHe will tell world leaders that the sophisticated capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and preserve the front line defences. He is also expected to reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine to help in the immediate conflict.\n\nThe capability step change underlines the Prime Minister's push to help Ukraine seize a window of opportunity to push back Russian forces and help Ukraine defend and regain territory for the long term. The Prime Minister raised the possible provision of the longer range weapons with President Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK earlier this month.\n\nThe acceleration comes as Ukraine prepares to mark a year since Russia's barbaric full scale invasion today [FRI]. The Prime Minister will join military personnel in Downing Street, as part of a national moment of reflection at 11am, to pay tribute to the bravery and courage of all the Ukrainians in their fight against Russia.\n\nAlongside the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, the Prime Minister will host members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Downing Street, as well as representatives from the 10 nations supporting the Government's Interflex training programme, including trainers from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland.\n\nJoined by his wife, Akshata Murty, the Prime Minister will also hang a blue and yellow wreath on the No10 door.\n\nPrime Minster Rishi Sunak said:\n\nAs we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country.\n\nI am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\n\nLater in the day, the Prime Minister will tell G7 allies in the virtual meeting that he has been humbled by Ukraine's bravery and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's leadership, and is proud of the united response from international partners, including the G7.\n\nHe is expected to say:\n\nFor Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\n\nThe coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\n\nHis rallying call at the G7 will come as the Foreign Secretary speaks at the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York today to call on countries to step up their support for Ukraine to help the country secure a lasting peace on their terms.\n\nHe will set out how Russia's continued targeting of Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, and key agricultural sites, has exacerbated global food prices and hurt the most vulnerable.",

                    "body": "A year of Ukraine's extraordinary resistance to Vladimir Putin's all-out assault that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced has been marked with a minute's silence.\n\nRishi Sunak was joined outside No 10 by wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister will use a call with G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to \"move faster\" in arming Volodymyr Zelensky's resistance against the invasion.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by Mr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian President.\n\nA part-destroyed business tower in Kyiv, ahead of the first anniversary (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\n\"It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin,\" he told Times Radio.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian President will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nMr Cleverly told Times Radio: \"We have committed to ensure that Putin fails in his attempt to invade Ukraine and as that realisation of his failure dawns on him, he will use every trick in the book.\n\nSome 461 paper angels, one for each child that has died in the past year according to official statistics, hang from the roof of the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London (Yui Mok/PA)\n\n\"He will threaten escalation and he will probably threaten nuclear use. What we have to say to the Russian people is that there is not and has never been a threat to Russia itself.\n\n\"This is a purely defensive posture. No one else is talking about this kind of escalation and there is no threat to Russia itself.\"\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nUkrainian troops and their UK military instructors (Gareth Fuller/PA)\n\nMr Sunak will use the virtual G7 meeting to urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the conflict is stuck in a bloody stalemate.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence,\" Mr Sunak was expected to say.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nThe Penshaw Monument near Sunderland flooded with blue and yellow lights during the night to mark the one-year anniversary of the start of the all-out assault (Owen Humphreys/PA)\n\nMr Sunak is expected to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

                    "body": "Volodymyr Zelensky has led an extraordinary year-long resistance but hundreds of thousands have been killed and millions displaced.\n\nA year of Ukraine's extraordinary resistance to Vladimir Putin's all-out assault that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced has been marked with a minute's silence.\n\nRishi Sunak was joined outside No 10 by wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by Mr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian President.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\n\"It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin,\" he told Times Radio.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian President will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nMr Cleverly told Times Radio: \"We have committed to ensure that Putin fails in his attempt to invade Ukraine and as that realisation of his failure dawns on him, he will use every trick in the book.\n\n\"This is a purely defensive posture. No one else is talking about this kind of escalation and there is no threat to Russia itself.\"\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence,\" Mr Sunak was expected to say.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also marked the moment on a visit to Cardiff where he had met members of the Ukrainian community.\n\nKing Charles released a statement describing how the Ukrainian people had shown \"truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy\", adding: \"I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nPoliticians including former prime minister Boris Johnson and London mayor Sadiq Khan attended a prayer service earlier at the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in the capital to mark the anniversary.\n\nAfter a choir of children sang, candles were lit by the congregation and pictures of those who had lost their lives in the war were shown on a screen.\n\nAnd faith leaders from across the city offered prayers for those living through the war.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Khan said: \"To those who have been forced to flee your homes, to those who have lost family and friends and to those sick with worry for loved ones in Ukraine - we cant ever know what you are going through, but know that London stands with you.\n\n\"We stand up for your rights to live free from fear, free from threats, free from intimidation, violence and terror because these are rights that are fundamental to our way of life. And we recognise Ukrainians are risking their lives, not just for the future of Ukraine, but for the future of Europe.\"\n\nMr Prystaiko also spoke to thank those who supported Ukraine, adding: \"This 24 February, this date will remain etched in our memory forever.\n\n\"It is a day when the West and the whole world finally understood what was happening and woke up to the challenge.\n\n\"You gave us reassurance that we are not alone... we are forever grateful for all of you.\"\n\nMr Johnson did not speak at the event, but received a round of applause as he left after shouting \"Salava Ukraini\" - meaning \"glory to Ukraine\".\n\nLater on Friday, Mr Sunak is expected to use a virtual G7 meeting to urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" to arm Ukraine's troops.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset,\" he is expected to say.\n\n\"This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are overreaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nGrant Shapps and Ukrainian refugee family describe living together\n\nThis is how many civilians have lost their lives in Ukraine over the past year\n\nUkraine has continued to appeal to the West to send fighter jets to help them in their fight.\n\nTheir appeal has been backed by former Mr Johnson, who told Sky News on Thursday that the UK needs to \"break the ice\" by becoming the first country to supply the aircraft.\n\nBut Mr Sunak and defence secretary Ben Wallace have refused the request.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, Mr Wallace said he couldn't \"rule anything in or anything out\" in the long-term.\n\nBut he added: \"We're not going to send our own typhoon jets in the in the short term to Ukraine. We've been quite clear about that.\"",

                    "body": "Sam Blewett, Gavin Cordon and Dominic McGrath, PA Political Staff\n\nA year of Ukraine's extraordinary resistance to Vladimir Putin's all-out assault that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced has been marked with a minute's silence.\n\nRishi Sunak was joined outside No 10 by wife Akshata Murthy, Kyiv's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause on Friday morning.\n\nThe King issued a message praising the \"remarkable courage and resilience\" of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo give Kyiv a \"decisive advantage\", Britain was trying to revive plans to provide eastern European allies with fighter jets so they can release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister will use a call with G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to \"move faster\" in arming Volodymyr Zelensky's resistance against the invasion.\n\nBritain also announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Mr Putin launched his renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, many believed his military might would capture Kyiv within weeks or even days.\n\nBut the Ukrainian resistance led by Mr Zelensky and assisted by the weapons and support provided by allies, including Britain, repelled the invasion to the east.\n\nAt least 100,000 of each side's soldiers are estimated to have been killed or injured, thousands more civilians have died and more than 13 million people have been made refugees or displaced inside Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky vowed Ukraine will do everything in its power to defeat the invasion before another anniversary can be marked.\n\n\"It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian President.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\n\"It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin,\" he told Times Radio.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian President will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nMr Cleverly told Times Radio: \"We have committed to ensure that Putin fails in his attempt to invade Ukraine and as that realisation of his failure dawns on him, he will use every trick in the book.\n\n\"He will threaten escalation and he will probably threaten nuclear use. What we have to say to the Russian people is that there is not and has never been a threat to Russia itself.\n\n\"This is a purely defensive posture. No one else is talking about this kind of escalation and there is no threat to Russia itself.\"\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nMr Sunak will use the virtual G7 meeting to urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the conflict is stuck in a bloody stalemate.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence,\" Mr Sunak was expected to say.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nMr Sunak is expected to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity,\" he said in a national address.\n\n\"The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year.\"\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian President.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for territorial gain measured \"in metres not miles\" and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\n\"It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin,\" he told Times Radio.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions and warned the failing Russian President will \"probably threaten nuclear use\".\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nMr Cleverly told Times Radio: \"We have committed to ensure that Putin fails in his attempt to invade Ukraine and as that realisation of his failure dawns on him, he will use every trick in the book.\n\n\"He will threaten escalation and he will probably threaten nuclear use. What we have to say to the Russian people is that there is not and has never been a threat to Russia itself.\n\n\"This is a purely defensive posture. No one else is talking about this kind of escalation and there is no threat to Russia itself.\"\n\nCharles, who hosted Mr Zelensky at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, said that Ukraine has \"shown truly remarkable courage and resilience\" while suffering \"unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation\".\n\n\"It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time,\" the King said in his message.\n\n\"Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.\"\n\nMr Sunak will use the virtual G7 meeting to urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the conflict is stuck in a bloody stalemate.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence,\" Mr Sunak was expected to say.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nMr Sunak is expected to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

He looked solemn as he took part in the tribute.\n\nUkraine's embassador for Britain Vadym Prystaiko and his wife Inna Prystaiko were among the attendees, as well as Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, all who were pictured lighting candles in tribute.\n\nMr Johnson described it as a 'powerful' service in a tweet this morning.\n\n'We paid tribute to all those who have lost their lives in the year since Putin launched his illegal and horrific invasion,' he wrote.\n\nHis message came as King Charles III condemned the 'unprovoked full-scale attack' on Ukraine and declared that the world stood 'united'.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Boris Johnson lights one of 52 candles - one for each week of the war\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan also lights one of the candles during the prayer service in London\n\nCharles said in his message: 'It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy.\n\n'The world has watched in horror at all the unnecessary suffering inflicted upon Ukrainians, many of whom I have had the great pleasure of meeting here in the UK and, indeed, across the world, from Romania to Canada.\n\n'Earlier this month I met President Zelensky at Buckingham Palace to express my personal support for the people of Ukraine. It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time.\n\n'Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.'\n\nMr Johnson, who was Prime Minister when the war began and when few believed Ukraine could hold out against Russia, has become a vocal advocate of the need to send fighter jets to the Ukrainians.\n\n'Now is the time to give President Zelensky the tools the Ukrainians need to finish the job,' he has said.\n\n'The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need.\n\n'And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\n\n'A swift Ukrainian victory is the humane, compassionate and economically sensible outcome.'\n\nAn ecumenical prayer service at the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London\n\nUkraine's embassador for Britain Vadym Prystaiko (R) and his wife Inna Prystaiko (L)\n\nBoris Johnson described the service as 'powerful' in a tweet this morning\n\nA woman dries her tears during the prayer service today, on the one year anniversary of Ukraine's invasion by Russia\n\n'We paid tribute to all those who have lost their lives in the year since Putin launched his illegal and horrific invasion,' Mr Johnson said\n\nA woman praying during the service as many paid poignant tributes\n\nFormer Prime Minister Boris Johnson (right) speaks to Mayor of London Sadiq Khan (left)\n\nChildren from St Mary's Ukrainian School attended the service\n\nRead more: President Zelensky vows to bring Putin's 'murderers' to justice after a 'year of pain' Advertisement\n\nPM Rishi Sunak, who will also host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10 accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\n'As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,' he said.\n\n'I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.'\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support 'is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago'.\n\n'As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,' he said.\n\n'No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year.\n\n'Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.'\n\nKing Charles III condemned the 'unprovoked full-scale attack' on Ukraine and declared that the world stood 'united'\n\nUkraine's president has pledged to push for victory in 2023 as he and other Ukrainians marked the sombre first anniversary of the Russian invasion that changed their lives.\n\nAs dawn broke on a day of commemorations and defiance, President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that Ukrainians had proven themselves to be 'invincible' in what he called 'a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity'.\n\n'We know that 2023 will be the year of our victory!' the tweet said.\n\nIn a defiant video address, Mr Zelensky recalled the terror unleashed a year ago by the Russian assault, triggering Europe's biggest and deadliest war since the Second World War.\n\nHe said February 24, 2022, the date of the Russian invasion, was 'the longest day of our lives'.\n\n'We survived the first day of the full-scale war. We didn't know what tomorrow would bring, but we clearly understood that for each tomorrow, you need to fight. And we fought,' he said.\n\nA year on, casualty figures are horrific on both sides, with Western estimates suggesting hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded.\n\nEconomic and diplomatic repercussions have rippled across the globe.",

The call will come on a day of events to mark one year since the war began.\n\nThere will be a minute's silence in the UK at 11.00 GMT, and Sunak will host Ukrainian troops at a Downing Street event.\n\nOther British political leaders will also mark the anniversary, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer calling for the UK to \"double down\" on support for Ukraine.\n\nThe conflict, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February last year, has seen at least 100,000 of each side's soldiers killed or injured, according to the US military.\n\nThousands of civilians have also been killed, with more than 13 million people made refugees abroad or displaced within Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has been urging its Western backers to increase support, as Russia mobilises ahead of an expected spring offensive.\n\nDuring the virtual meeting of leaders from the G7 group of advanced economies, Sunak is expected to say an acceleration in support is \"what it will take to shift Putin's mindset\".\n\n\"This must be our priority now,\" he will add. \"Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\"\n\nHe is expected to make the argument for supplying Ukraine with \"longer-range weapons\" to disrupt Russia's ability to target Ukraine's infrastructure, something to which he committed the UK earlier this month.\n\nDuring a recent tour of Europe, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky increased his calls for Western nations to supply his country with modern fighter jets.\n\nThe UK is to start training Ukrainian forces to fly Nato-standard jets. But like other Western nations, it has so far not supplied jets, saying it remains a long-term option.\n\nAlthough support for Ukraine has united the UK's main political parties, Mr Sunak has faced pressure from some of his own Conservative MPs to supply fast jets as soon as possible.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was in office when Russia invaded and is among those urging faster action on jets, used the anniversary to repeat his call to give President Zelensky weapons \"to finish the job\".\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need,\" he said in a statement released to journalists.\n\n\"And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\"",

He is expected to reiterate his offer of the UK's support to nations able to provide jets to Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict.\n\n\"He will tell world leaders that the sophisticated capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and preserve the front line defences. He is also expected to reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine to help in the immediate conflict,\" the UK Prime Minister's Office said in a press release.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War Anniversary: This Will Be the Year of Our Victory, Says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nSunak had raised the possible provision of the longer range weapons with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK earlier this month. During the G7 meeting, PM Sunak will laud the strength of international community in supporting Ukraine. He will call for providing longer range weapons to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the press release, Sunak will join military personnel at Downing Street at 11 am (local time) to pay tribute to the bravery and courage of all the Ukrainians in their fight against Russia.

As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\" Notably, the UK has been providing economic and defence support to Ukraine ever since Moscow began its offensive in Kyiv.\n\nAccording to the press release, Sunak is expected to say, \"For Ukraine to win this war and to accelerate that day, they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\"\n\nIn the voting on a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on the need to reach comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, nations on Thursday condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe assembly demanded Moscow to withdraw from Kyiv \"immediately,\" with an appeal for the need to reach comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine. In the UNGA, 141 members voted in favour of the resolution, 32 abstained, including India and China, while seven voted against it.

He is expected to reiterate his offer of the UK's support to nations able to provide jets to Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the G7 meeting on Friday will call on international partners to help Ukraine degrade Russian forces beyond the frontlines of the conflict. He is expected to reiterate his offer of the UK's support to nations able to provide jets to Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict. \"He will tell world leaders that the sophisticated capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and preserve the front line defences. He is also expected to reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine to help in the immediate conflict,\" the UK Prime Minister's Office said in a press release.\n\nSunak had raised the possible provision of the longer range weapons with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK earlier this month. During the G7 meeting, PM Sunak will laud the strength of international community in supporting Ukraine. He will call for providing longer range weapons to Ukraine. According to the press release, Sunak will join military personnel at Downing Street at 11 am (local time) to pay tribute to the bravery and courage of all the Ukrainians in their fight against Russia. Sunak along with Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street and representatives from the 10 nations supporting the government's Interflex training programme.\n\nIn the press release, Rishi Sunak said, \"As we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country.\" He added, \"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\" Notably, the UK has been providing economic and defence support to Ukraine ever since Moscow began its offensive in Kyiv.\n\nAccording to the press release, Sunak is expected to say, \"For Ukraine to win this war and to accelerate that day, they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\" In the voting on a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on the need to reach comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, nations on Thursday condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe assembly demanded Moscow to withdraw from Kyiv \"immediately,\" with an appeal for the need to reach comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine. In the UNGA, 141 members voted in favour of the resolution, 32 abstained, including India and China, while seven voted against it.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "London [UK], February 24 (ANI): United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the G7 meeting on Friday will call on international partners to help Ukraine degrade Russian forces beyond the frontlines of the conflict. He is expected to reiterate his offer of the UK's support to nations able to provide jets to Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict.\n\n\"He will tell world leaders that the sophisticated capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and preserve the front line defences. He is also expected to reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine to help in the immediate conflict,\" the UK Prime Minister's Office said in a press release.\n\nSunak had raised the possible provision of the longer range weapons with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK earlier this month. During the G7 meeting, PM Sunak will laud the strength of international community in supporting Ukraine. He will call for providing longer range weapons to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the press release, Sunak will join military personnel at Downing Street at 11 am (local time) to pay tribute to the bravery and courage of all the Ukrainians in their fight against Russia. Sunak along with Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street and representatives from the 10 nations supporting the government's Interflex training programme.\n\nIn the press release, Rishi Sunak said, \"As we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country.\"\n\nHe added, \"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\" Notably, the UK has been providing economic and defence support to Ukraine ever since Moscow began its offensive in Kyiv.\n\nAccording to the press release, Sunak is expected to say, \"For Ukraine to win this war and to accelerate that day, they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\"\n\nIn the voting on a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on the need to reach comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, nations on Thursday condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe assembly demanded Moscow to withdraw from Kyiv \"immediately,\" with an appeal for the need to reach comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine. In the UNGA, 141 members voted in favour of the resolution, 32 abstained, including India and China, while seven voted against it. (ANI)",

                    "body": "ritain is prepared to supply fighter jets to eastern European allies to enable them to release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine, the Defence Secretary has said.\n\nBen Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nHis comments came on Friday as Rishi Sunak prepared to lead the nation in a minute's silence to mark a year of Russian President Vladimir Putin's all-out assault on his neighbour.\n\nBritain announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister will use a call with G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to urge allies to \"move faster\" in arming Volodymyr Zelensky's resistance against the invasion.\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian President.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the UK is taking steps to rebuild its munitions stockpiles that have been depleted by the war and have \"borne the brunt of defence cuts\" in recent decades.\n\n\"We have now started to place orders to replenish them and where we haven't placed orders we have started the work to make sure we have the supply chain or find alternative sources,\" he told Sky News.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for very little territorial gain and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\n\"It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin,\" he told Times Radio.\n\n\"That's why we see huge losses amongst the Russian army and only gains - where we see gains - in metres not miles.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions.\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nMr Cleverly warned Mr Putin will \"probably threaten nuclear use\" as he fails in Ukraine.\n\n\"We have committed to ensure that Putin fails in his attempt to invade Ukraine and as that realisation of his failure dawns on him, he will use every trick in the book,\" he told Times Radio.\n\n\"He will use cyber, he will use disinformation, he will try and call in any and every favour in the international community that he can.\n\n\"He will threaten escalation and he will probably threaten nuclear use. What we have to say to the Russian people is that there is not and has never been a threat to Russia itself.\n\n\"This is a purely defensive posture. No one else is talking about this kind of escalation and there is no threat to Russia itself.\"\n\nIn the virtual G7 meeting, Mr Sunak will urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Mr Putin's forces continues.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak was expected to say.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nAt the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak is expected to urge other nations to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nMr Sunak, who will also host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10 accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, soldiers are braced for a Russian spring offensive.\n\nBut Mr Putin's original plan of taking the country in only a matter of days failed, with a vast amount of the current fighting centring around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nBoris Johnson, who was prime minister when the war began and when few believed Ukraine could hold out against Russia, has become a vocal advocate of the need to send fighter jets to the Ukrainians.\n\n\"Now is the time to give President Zelensky the tools the Ukrainians need to finish the job,\" he said.\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need. And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\n\n\"A swift Ukrainian victory is the humane, compassionate and economically sensible outcome.\"\n\nIn New York, Mr Cleverly will tell a special session of the UN Security Council that support for Ukraine cannot be \"time-limited\".\n\nThe Foreign Secretary will meet his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, as well as UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a non-binding resolution, backed by 141 nations, calling for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and demanding the withdrawal of its forces.\n\nIn the UK, politicians have been united on the need to stand with Ukraine.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

                    "title": "Top Stories: Rishi Sunak Urges G7 Leaders To \"Move Faster\" In Arming Ukraine, Boris Johnson Increases Pressure To Send British Jets",
                    "body": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will use the one year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to pressure other world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming its military.\n\nSunak will use a meeting of the G7 to make the plea for allies to supply more long-range weapons to help give Ukraine a \"decisive advantage\" on the battlefield.\n\nHe is expected to tell G7 leaders during the call: \"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset.\"\n\n\"This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be for Russia. They are overreaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup and push forward.\"\n\nSunak will also lead a UK-wide minute of silence at 11am, with the Prime Minister expected to appear outside Downing Street alongside Ukraine's Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, and members of the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nMinisters also used the one-year anniversary to launch a series of further sanctions on Russia, claiming they were now banning the export of every item Russia has used on the battlefield.\n\nThe international co-ordinated sanctions package extends beyond conventional weaponary and includes hundreds of goods, including radio and electronic equipment as well as parts which could be used to maintain and repair aircraft.\n\nThe sanctions will also target a further four Russian banks and senior executives at Russia's two largest defence companies.\n\nAnnouncing the latest measures, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said: \"Ukrainians are turning the tide on Russia, but they cannot do it alone. That is why we must do more to help Ukraine win.\n\n\"Today we are sanctioning the elitres who run Putin's key industries and committing to prohibit the export to Russia of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield.\"\n\nThe former prime minister has heaped pressure on the government to send fighter jets to Ukraine as he urged Rishi Sunak to \"break the ice\" by offering Typhoon fighter planes to the country's airforce.\n\nJohnson suggested the UK could encourage a wave of Western countries to supply fighter jets to Ukraine if they chose to donate the planes \"sooner rather than later\".\n\n\"The last year has taught us sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"And it that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's absolutely crucial that we give them the supplies and support they need to get on and finish it. 2023 has got to be the year of victory for Ukraine.\n\n\"It's the best thing for Ukraine - it's the best thing for the Russian people. It's the best thing for the world.\"\n\nMinisters had initially ruled out sending the hi-tech fighter planes to Ukraine, claiming that training pilots to use them would be too time-consuming, but promised to conduct a review following a plea from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky during a historic speech to Parliamentarians earlier this month.\n\nSpeaking in Westminster Hall, the Ukrainian leader urged the UK to provide the jets, saying they were crucial to defence efforts.\n\nBut speaking on Friday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK would not deliver fighter planes in the \"short term\".\n\n\"The one thing I have learnt in this conflict is you can't rule anything in and rule anything out,\" he told Sky News.\n\nWallace said the UK had already provided nearly 200 tanks and helicopters to Ukraine, but said that providing fighter planes would mean deploying \"hundreds of people\" to the country to help with training and maintenance, adding \"the West is not going to be putting troops into Ukraine in those scales\".\n\nThe anniversary of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine has also prompted continued support from opposition parties, who have pledged to keep offering their backing to the government on their response to the war.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Labour leader Keir Starmer said he hoped UK parties would continue to offer a unified approach to Russia's aggression, saying it was time to \"double down\" on support for Ukraine.\n\n\"The resolve and the bravery of the Ukrainian people, supported by their allies across the world, has doomed Putin's barbaric invasion to failure,\" he said.\n\n\"We should take inspiration from their courage and resolve to double down on support for them.\n\n\"Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said the whole country would \"stand in solidarity with Ukraine until they achieve victory\" as he praised the \"amazing acts of heroism\".\n\nTo mark the anniversary Westminster Council leader Adam Hug announcing the decision to rename part of Bayswater Road as \"Kyiv Road\".\n\nThe section of road is close to where the Russian embassy in London is based, with Hug saying it was a \"fitting gesture\" to pay tribute to Ukraine.\n\n\"It's a small stretch of road, but we want to show the people of Ukraine that their struggle has a visible place in our city,\" he said.\n\nPoliticsHome Newsletters",

                    "body": "Ukraine is marking one year since the Russian invasion, with the UK set to join allies in pledging to stand with the war-torn country for as long as is needed.\n\nToday (Friday, 24 February) people of Pembrokeshire fall silent with the rest of the UK to commemorate the war, which has seen thousands of civilians and soldiers killed and injured.\n\n\"Today marks a year since the full-scale illegal invasion of Ukraine. Since that day, Wales has stood alongside the people of Ukraine,\" said a statement from the Welsh government.\n\n\"At 11am, we join others around the world in a minute of silence to acknowledge the strength and bravery of the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nIn London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will lead a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary, with G7 leaders set to meet to discuss a conflict that has scarred Europe and shaken the West.\n\nWith no end in sight for the war, Mr Sunak will urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Vladimir Putin's forces continues.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset.\n\n\"This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell world leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nCrowds gathered in Trafalgar Square in London to mark the anniversary on Thursday evening, where Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and other speakers praised the bravery of Ukrainian fighters.\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's call for fighter jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies.\n\nMr Zelensky, whose leadership during the war has turned him into a global figure, embarked on a whirlwind of diplomacy in recent weeks as he toured Washington and European capitals to pressure allies on the need for further help.\n\nAt the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak is expected to urge other nations to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nMr Sunak, who also will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10 accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, soldiers are braced for a Russian spring offensive. But Mr Putin's original plan of taking the country in only a matter of days failed, with a vast amount of the current fighting centring around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nBoris Johnson, who was prime minister when the war began and when few believed Ukraine could hold out against Russia, has become a vocal advocate of the need to send jet fighters to the Ukrainians.\n\n\"Now is the time to give President Zelensky the tools the Ukrainians need to finish the job,\" he said.\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need. And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\n\n\"A swift Ukrainian victory is the humane, compassionate and economically sensible outcome.\"\n\nIn New York, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will tell a special session of the UN Security Council that support for Ukraine cannot be \"time-limited\".\n\nWhile there, he will meet his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, as well as UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a non-binding resolution, backed by 141 nations, calling for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and demanding the withdrawal of its forces.\n\nIn the UK, politicians have been united on the need to stand with Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the whole country would \"stand in solidarity with Ukraine until they achieve victory\".",

                    "body": "ritain is prepared to supply fighter jets to eastern European allies to enable them to release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine, the Defence Secretary has said.\n\nBen Wallace said backfilling allies with the UK's jets to free up their own would be a quicker way to bolster Kyiv's defences than providing them with British Typhoons.\n\nHis comments came on Friday as Rishi Sunak prepared to lead the nation in a minute's silence to mark a year of Russian President Vladimir Putin's all-out assault on his neighbour.\n\nBritain announced a new package of sanctions, imposing an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister will use a call with G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden, to \"move faster\" in arming Volodymyr Zelensky's resistance against the invasion.\n\nBritain will be training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets but allies have been reluctant to release the modern warplanes requested by the Ukrainian President.\n\nMr Wallace told Times Radio \"the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets - MiG 29s or Su-24s - if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result\".\n\n\"They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't,\" he said.\n\nMr Wallace said the UK is taking steps to rebuild its munitions stockpiles that have been depleted by the war and have \"borne the brunt of defence cuts\" in recent decades.\n\n\"We have now started to place orders to replenish them and where we haven't placed orders we have started the work to make sure we have the supply chain or find alternative sources,\" he told Sky News.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering \"huge losses\" on the battlefield for very little territorial gain and will sacrifice a growing number of troops to satisfy Mr Putin's demands.\n\n\"It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin,\" he told Times Radio.\n\n\"That's why we see huge losses amongst the Russian army and only gains - where we see gains - in metres not miles.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced the internationally co-ordinated new package of sanctions.\n\nExport bans have been extended to include hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex.\n\nThe UK also sanctioned senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia's two largest defence companies and four banks.\n\nMr Cleverly said: \"Ukrainians are turning the tide on Russia but they cannot do it alone. That is why we must do more to help Ukraine win.\n\n\"Today we are sanctioning the elites who run Putin's key industries and committing to prohibit the export to Russia of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield.\"\n\nIn the virtual G7 meeting, Mr Sunak will urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Mr Putin's forces continues.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak was expected to say.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nAt the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak is expected to urge other nations to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nMr Sunak, who will also host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10 accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, soldiers are braced for a Russian spring offensive.\n\nBut Mr Putin's original plan of taking the country in only a matter of days failed, with a vast amount of the current fighting centring around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nBoris Johnson, who was prime minister when the war began and when few believed Ukraine could hold out against Russia, has become a vocal advocate of the need to send fighter jets to the Ukrainians.\n\n\"Now is the time to give President Zelensky the tools the Ukrainians need to finish the job,\" he said.\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need. And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\n\n\"A swift Ukrainian victory is the humane, compassionate and economically sensible outcome.\"\n\nIn New York, Mr Cleverly will tell a special session of the UN Security Council that support for Ukraine cannot be \"time-limited\".\n\nThe Foreign Secretary will meet his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, as well as UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a non-binding resolution, backed by 141 nations, calling for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and demanding the withdrawal of its forces.\n\nIn the UK, politicians have been united on the need to stand with Ukraine.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell G7 leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are overreaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to rearm, regroup, and push forward.\"",

That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell world leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nCrowds gathered in Trafalgar Square in London to mark the anniversary on Thursday evening, where Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and other speakers praised the bravery of Ukrainian fighters.\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's call for fighter jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies.\n\nMr Zelensky, whose leadership during the war has turned him into a global figure, embarked on a whirlwind of diplomacy in recent weeks as he toured Washington and European capitals to pressure allies on the need for further help.\n\nAt the G7 meeting, Sunak is expected to urge other nations to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nSunak, who also will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10 accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, soldiers are braced for a Russian spring offensive. But Mr Putin's original plan of taking the country in only a matter of days failed, with a vast amount of the current fighting centring around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nBoris Johnson, who was prime minister when the war began and when few believed Ukraine could hold out against Russia, has become a vocal advocate of the need to send jet fighters to the Ukrainians.\n\n\"Now is the time to give President Zelensky the tools the Ukrainians need to finish the job,\" he said.\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need. And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\n\n\"A swift Ukrainian victory is the humane, compassionate and economically sensible outcome.\"\n\nIn New York, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will tell a special session of the UN Security Council that support for Ukraine cannot be \"time-limited\".\n\nWhile there, he will meet his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, as well as UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a non-binding resolution, backed by 141 nations, calling for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and demanding the withdrawal of its forces.\n\nIn the UK, politicians have been united on the need to stand with Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the whole country would \"stand in solidarity with Ukraine until they achieve victory\".",

We are ready for anything. We will defeat everyone. This is how it began on February 24, 2022. The longest day of our lives. The most difficult day in our recent history. We woke up early and haven't slept since,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, Mr Zelensky attended a service in Kyiv which commemorated those who gave their lives to protect their country.\n\nComforting widows and mothers who lost their sons, the president gave his condolences and said Ukraine would \"never forget\" what they have done for the country.\n\nAround the world, people are commemorating 12 months of war, with parliamentary buildings lit up in Ukraine's colours of blue and yellow.",

As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.'\n\nIn London, Mr Sunak will lead a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary.\n\nMr Sunak, who also will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10 accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\nG7 leaders are set to meet to discuss a conflict that has scarred Europe and shaken the West.\n\nWith no end in sight for the war, Mr Sunak will urge his fellow world leaders to 'move faster' in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Vladimir Putin's forces continues.\n\n'For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,' Mr Sunak is expected to tell world leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\nUkraine has been coping with the devastation of the Russian invasion for a year (pictured, Mariupol last April)\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky pleaded for fighter jets on a tour of Europe that started in the UK earlier this month (pictured)\n\n'The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.'\n\nCrowds gathered in Trafalgar Square in London to mark the anniversary on Thursday evening, where Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and other speakers praised the bravery of Ukrainian fighters.\n\nIn his interviews, Mr Wallace said Russia has been forced to adopt a 'meat-grinder approach' after its forces failed to make a breakthrough in Ukraine.\n\nMr Wallace said the Russian army was suffering 'huge losses' on the battlefield for very little gain in territory.\n\n'It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin\n\n'That's why we see huge losses amongst the Russian army and only gains, where we see gains, in metres not miles.'",

                    "body": "Ukrainian soldiers man snow-covered trenches along the frontline in the southern Donbas area of Druzhba, Ukraine, on February 18, 2023.\n\nVladimir Putin is likely pursuing a long-term operation to \"eventually exhaust\" Ukraine, western officials have said.\n\nThe ministry of defence [MoD] said Russia had \"changed its approach again\" in a statement issued on the first anniversary of the war.\n\nInstead of trying to seize the whole of Ukraine - after Putin's original plan to take the country in a matter of days failed - Russia hopes to wear down the military.\n\nMuch of the current fighting now centres around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nA fire broke out on a building after Russian shelling as military mobility continues within the Russian-Ukrainian war in Bakhmut, Ukraine on February 15, 2023.\n\nToday marks one-year since the start of Russia's invasion that has killed thousands and uprooted millions.\n\nIn the UK - which has issued more than 200,000 visas to Ukrainian refugees - a one-minute silence will be led by prime minister Rishi Sunak at 11am.\n\n\"Since 2014 Russia's strategic goal in Ukraine has highly likely been consistent: to control its neighbour,\" the MoD said.\n\n\"Over 2014-2021, it pursued this objective through subversion, by fomenting an undeclared war in the Donbas, and by annexing Crimea.\n\n\"On 24 February 2022, Russia pivoted to a new approach and launched a full-scale invasion which attempted to seize the whole country and depose its government.\n\n\"By April 2022, Russia realised this had failed, and focused on expanding and formalising its rule over the Donbas and the south. It has made slow and extremely costly progress.\n\n\"In recent weeks, Russia has likely changed its approach again. Its campaign now likely primarily seeks to degrade the Ukrainian military, rather than being focused on seizing substantial new territory.\n\n\"The Russian leadership is likely pursuing a long-term operation where they bank that Russia's advantages in population and resources will eventually exhaust Ukraine.\"\n\nG7 leaders are set to meet virtually to discuss the conflict that has scarred Europe and shaken the west.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on February 8, 2023.\n\nSunak will urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Putin's forces continues.\n\n\"Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Sunak is expected to tell them.\n\nCrowds gathered in Trafalgar Square in London to mark the anniversary on Thursday evening, where defence secretary Ben Wallace praised the bravery of Ukrainian fighters.\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's call for fighter jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies.",

                    "body": "Vladimir Putin is likely pursuing a long-term operation to \"eventually exhaust\" Ukraine, western officials have said.\n\nThe ministry of defence [MoD] said Russia had \"changed its approach again\" in a statement issued on the first anniversary of the war.\n\nInstead of trying to seize the whole of Ukraine - after Putin's original plan to take the country in a matter of days failed - Russia hopes to wear down the military.\n\nMuch of the current fighting now centres around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nToday marks one-year since the start of Russia's invasion that has killed thousands and uprooted millions.\n\nIn the UK - which has issued more than 200,000 visas to Ukrainian refugees - a one-minute silence will be led by prime minister Rishi Sunak at 11am.\n\n\"Since 2014 Russia's strategic goal in Ukraine has highly likely been consistent: to control its neighbour,\" the MoD said.\n\n\"Over 2014-2021, it pursued this objective through subversion, by fomenting an undeclared war in the Donbas, and by annexing Crimea.\n\n\"On 24 February 2022, Russia pivoted to a new approach and launched a full-scale invasion which attempted to seize the whole country and depose its government.\n\n\"By April 2022, Russia realised this had failed, and focused on expanding and formalising its rule over the Donbas and the south. It has made slow and extremely costly progress.\n\n\"In recent weeks, Russia has likely changed its approach again. Its campaign now likely primarily seeks to degrade the Ukrainian military, rather than being focused on seizing substantial new territory.\n\n\"The Russian leadership is likely pursuing a long-term operation where they bank that Russia's advantages in population and resources will eventually exhaust Ukraine.\"\n\nG7 leaders are set to meet virtually to discuss the conflict that has scarred Europe and shaken the west.\n\nSunak will urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Putin's forces continues.\n\n\"Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Sunak is expected to tell them.\n\nCrowds gathered in Trafalgar Square in London to mark the anniversary on Thursday evening, where defence secretary Ben Wallace praised the bravery of Ukrainian fighters.\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's call for fighter jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies.",

                    "body": "The UK is set to join allies in pledging to stand with Ukraine for as long as is needed as the war-torn country marks one year since the Russian invasion.\n\nThe Prime Minister will lead a national minute's silence from London to mark the anniversary, with G7 leaders preparing to meet for talks over a conflict that has scarred Europe and shaken the West. With no end of the war in sight, Rishi Sunak will urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Vladimir Putin's forces continues.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell world leaders in a \"virtual\" meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\" Crowds gathered in Trafalgar Square in London to mark the anniversary on Thursday evening, where Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and other speakers praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people.\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces. But fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nUkraine's president, who called for fighter jets, has so far had a lukewarm response from western allies. Volodymyr Zelensky, whose leadership during the war has turned him into a global figure, embarked on a whirlwind of diplomacy in recent weeks as he toured Washington and European capitals to put pressure on allies to lend him more help.\n\nAt the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak is expected to urge other nations to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes. Mr Sunak, who also will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10, accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" he said. \"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict.\n\n\"As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, soldiers are braced for a Russian spring offensive. But Mr Putin's original plan of taking the country in only a matter of days failed, with a vast amount of the current fighting revolving around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nBoris Johnson, Britain's prime minister when the war began and when few believed Ukraine could hold out against Russia, has become a vocal advocate of the need to send jet fighters to the Ukrainians. \"Now is the time to give President Zelensky the tools the Ukrainians need to finish the job,\" he said.\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need. And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world. A swift Ukrainian victory is the humane, compassionate and economically sensible outcome.\"\n\nIn New York, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will tell a session of the UN Security Council that support for Ukraine cannot be \"time-limited\". While there, he will meet his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, as well as UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a non-binding resolution, backed by 141 nations, calling for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and demanding the withdrawal of its forces. In the UK, politicians have been united on the need to stand with Ukraine.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support was \"as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\". The Labour leader met Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the whole country would \"stand in solidarity with Ukraine until they achieve victory\".\n\nFor more stories from where you live, visit InYourArea.",

                    "body": "Rishi Sunak will tomorrow urge Western leaders to 'move faster' on increasing military support for Ukraine as the world marks the first anniversary of Russia's invasion.\n\nIn a rallying cry to the G7, Mr Sunak will call on members to follow Britain's lead in supplying longer-range weapons to aid President Volodymyr Zelensky's brave troops.\n\nHe believes the weapons will not only help Ukraine protect critical civilian infrastructure but also push back Russia's forces and regain territory lost in the bloody fighting.\n\nAhead of a meeting of the Western allies, the Prime Minister will join Ukrainian military personnel in Downing Street at 11am as Britain pays tribute to their nation's courage in a minute's silence.\n\nHe and his wife will also hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10.\n\nRishi Sunak will call on G7 members to follow Britain's lead in supplying longer-range weapons to aid Ukraine\n\nIn remarks published tonight, Mr Sunak said he was proud that Britain had stood 'shoulder to shoulder' with Ukraine 'through this horrific conflict'. President Zelensky yesterday vowed his country would prevail and that Russia 'the murderer' will be held to account.\n\nBoris Johnson also spoke out as the anniversary loomed, pushing for a 'swift Ukrainian victory' this year and repeating his call for the RAF to send Typhoon jets to Ukraine.\n\nTomorrow morning, Mr Sunak will host Ukrainian Ambassador Vadym Prystaiko and members of the country's armed forces in Downing Street before the minute's silence. Then, in a virtual call with G7 leaders, he will encourage them to join Britain in stepping up support.\n\nBritain is in discussions about sending longer-range weapons such as Harpoon anti-ship missiles or Storm Shadow air-to-surface missiles, as well as a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks, and has offered to support other countries that can provide jets.\n\nThe PM is expected to say: 'For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day -they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield.\n\n'That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence.\n\n'The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup and push forwards.' His Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will address the UN Security Council today, insisting that Britain will support Ukraine 'for as long as it takes', having provided \u00a32.3billion in military aid over the past year along with \u00a3220million in humanitarian assistance.\n\nTomorrow morning, Mr Sunak (pictured with Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this month) will host Ukrainian Ambassador Vadym Prystaiko and members of the country's armed forces in Downing Street before the minute's silence\n\nIt has also given more than 200,000 visas to people fleeing the warzone. At a meeting in India, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and G7 finance ministers committed to increase financial support for the Ukrainian government to a total of $39billion (\u00a332billion).\n\nHowever, Mr Johnson is continuing to demand that the West goes further still and starts giving fighter jets to Ukraine. President Zelensky made a request for 'wings for freedom' in his historic address to Parliament earlier this month.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News, Mr Johnson said today: 'What the Ukrainians want is F-16s. We don't have F-16s. We do have Typhoons. I think there is an argument for the UK breaking the ice and giving them some Typhoons.'\n\nHe added it would be a 'historic mistake' for China to arm the 'gangster' Putin.\n\nVigils were held across Britain tonight to mark the first anniversary of the invasion, including one in Trafalgar Square, while more will take place tomorrow.",

                    "body": "Source: United Kingdom - Prime Minister's Office 10 Downing Street\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak set to call on partners to increase Ukraine's capability to stop Russian forces\n\nComes as the UK prepares to supply longer range weapons to Ukraine to provide a decisive advantage to Ukraine\n\nRallying call to step up capability coincides with Ukraine preparing to mark one year since the unforgivable full-scale Russian invasion, with the UK set to observe a minute's silence at 11am today\n\nThe Prime Minister will call on international partners to help Ukraine degrade Russian forces beyond the front lines of the conflict in a G7 meeting today (Friday).\n\nLauding the strength and resolve of the international community in supporting Ukraine, as demonstrated by the G7, the Prime Minister will make the case for longer range weapons to be supplied to their armed forces.\n\nHe will tell world leaders that the sophisticated capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and preserve the front line defences. He is also expected to reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine to help in the immediate conflict.\n\nThe capability step change underlines the Prime Minister's push to help Ukraine seize a window of opportunity to push back Russian forces and help Ukraine defend and regain territory for the long term. The Prime Minister raised the possible provision of the longer range weapons with President Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK earlier this month.\n\nThe acceleration comes as Ukraine prepares to mark a year since Russia's barbaric full scale invasion today [FRI]. The Prime Minister will join military personnel in Downing Street, as part of a national moment of reflection at 11am, to pay tribute to the bravery and courage of all the Ukrainians in their fight against Russia.\n\nAlongside the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, the Prime Minister will host members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Downing Street, as well as representatives from the 10 nations supporting the Government's Interflex training programme, including trainers from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland.\n\nJoined by his wife, Akshata Murty, the Prime Minister will also hang a blue and yellow wreath on the No10 door.\n\nPrime Minster Rishi Sunak said:\n\nAs we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country.\n\nI am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\n\nLater in the day, the Prime Minister will tell G7 allies in the virtual meeting that he has been humbled by Ukraine's bravery and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's leadership, and is proud of the united response from international partners, including the G7.\n\nHe is expected to say:\n\nFor Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\n\nThe coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\n\nHis rallying call at the G7 will come as the Foreign Secretary speaks at the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York today to call on countries to step up their support for Ukraine to help the country secure a lasting peace on their terms.\n\nHe will set out how Russia's continued targeting of Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, and key agricultural sites, has exacerbated global food prices and hurt the most vulnerable.",

                    "body": "Ukraine is marking one year since the Russian invasion, with the UK set to join allies in pledging to stand with the war-torn country for as long as is needed.\n\nIn London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will lead a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary, with G7 leaders set to meet to discuss a conflict that has scarred Europe and shaken the West.\n\nWith no end in sight for the war, Mr Sunak will urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Vladimir Putin's forces continues.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell world leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nNow is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\n\nCrowds gathered in Trafalgar Square in London to mark the anniversary on Thursday evening, where Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and other speakers praised the bravery of Ukrainian fighters.\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's call for fighter jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies.\n\nMr Zelensky, whose leadership during the war has turned him into a global figure, embarked on a whirlwind of diplomacy in recent weeks as he toured Washington and European capitals to pressure allies on the need for further help.\n\nAt the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak is expected to urge other nations to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nMr Sunak, who also will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10 accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky outside 10 Downing Street with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (Victoria Jones/PA)\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, soldiers are braced for a Russian spring offensive. But Mr Putin's original plan of taking the country in only a matter of days failed, with a vast amount of the current fighting centring around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nBoris Johnson, who was prime minister when the war began and when few believed Ukraine could hold out against Russia, has become a vocal advocate of the need to send jet fighters to the Ukrainians.\n\n\"Now is the time to give President Zelensky the tools the Ukrainians need to finish the job,\" he said.\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need. And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\n\n\"A swift Ukrainian victory is the humane, compassionate and economically sensible outcome.\"\n\nIn New York, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will tell a special session of the UN Security Council that support for Ukraine cannot be \"time-limited\".\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace at a vigil in London on Thursday (James Manning/PA)\n\nWhile there, he will meet his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, as well as UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a non-binding resolution, backed by 141 nations, calling for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and demanding the withdrawal of its forces.\n\nIn the UK, politicians have been united on the need to stand with Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the whole country would \"stand in solidarity with Ukraine until they achieve victory\".",

                    "body": "Ukraine is marking one year since the Russian invasion, with the UK set to join allies in pledging to stand with the war-torn country for as long as is needed.\n\nIn London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will lead a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary, with G7 leaders set to meet to discuss a conflict that has scarred Europe and shaken the West.\n\nWith no end in sight for the war, Mr Sunak will urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Vladimir Putin's forces continues.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell world leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's call for fighter jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies.\n\nMr Zelensky, whose leadership during the war has turned him into a global figure, embarked on a whirlwind of diplomacy in recent weeks as he toured Washington and European capitals to pressure allies on the need for further help.\n\nAt the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak is expected to urge other nations to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nMr Sunak, who also will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10 accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, soldiers are braced for a Russian spring offensive. But Mr Putin's original plan of taking the country in only a matter of days failed, with a vast amount of the current fighting centring around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nBoris Johnson, who was prime minister when the war began and when few believed Ukraine could hold out against Russia, has become a vocal advocate of the need to send jet fighters to the Ukrainians.\n\n\"Now is the time to give President Zelensky the tools the Ukrainians need to finish the job,\" he said.\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need. And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\n\n\"A swift Ukrainian victory is the humane, compassionate and economically sensible outcome.\"\n\nIn New York, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will tell a special session of the UN Security Council that support for Ukraine cannot be \"time-limited\".\n\nThe UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a non-binding resolution, backed by 141 nations, calling for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and demanding the withdrawal of its forces.\n\nIn the UK, politicians have been united on the need to stand with Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the whole country would \"stand in solidarity with Ukraine until they achieve victory\".",

                    "body": "kraine is marking one year since the Russian invasion, with the UK set to join allies in pledging to stand with the war-torn country for as long as is needed.\n\nIn London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will lead a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary, with G7 leaders set to meet to discuss a conflict that has scarred Europe and shaken the West.\n\nWith no end in sight for the war, Mr Sunak will urge his fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming Ukraine's troops as the battle against Vladimir Putin's forces continues.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell world leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nCrowds gathered in Trafalgar Square in London to mark the anniversary on Thursday evening, where Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and other speakers praised the bravery of Ukrainian fighters.\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv, with the Government announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nBut fears remain that the war could continue for at least another year, even as Ukraine insists that further support and weaponry can help bring the conflict to a conclusion.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's call for fighter jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies.\n\nMr Zelensky, whose leadership during the war has turned him into a global figure, embarked on a whirlwind of diplomacy in recent weeks as he toured Washington and European capitals to pressure allies on the need for further help.\n\nAt the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak is expected to urge other nations to supply longer-range weapons to Kyiv, while also repeating his offer of British support to countries able to provide planes.\n\nMr Sunak, who also will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10 accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, soldiers are braced for a Russian spring offensive. But Mr Putin's original plan of taking the country in only a matter of days failed, with a vast amount of the current fighting centring around the battle for the east of Ukraine.\n\nBoris Johnson, who was prime minister when the war began and when few believed Ukraine could hold out against Russia, has become a vocal advocate of the need to send jet fighters to the Ukrainians.\n\n\"Now is the time to give President Zelensky the tools the Ukrainians need to finish the job,\" he said.\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need. And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\n\n\"A swift Ukrainian victory is the humane, compassionate and economically sensible outcome.\"\n\nIn New York, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will tell a special session of the UN Security Council that support for Ukraine cannot be \"time-limited\".\n\nWhile there, he will meet his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, as well as UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a non-binding resolution, backed by 141 nations, calling for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and demanding the withdrawal of its forces.\n\nIn the UK, politicians have been united on the need to stand with Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the country's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No-one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the whole country would \"stand in solidarity with Ukraine until they achieve victory\".",

                    "body": "Rallying call to step up capability coincides with Ukraine preparing to mark one year since the unforgivable full-scale Russian invasion, with the UK set to observe a minute's silence at 11am today\n\nThe Prime Minister will call on international partners to help Ukraine degrade Russian forces beyond the front lines of the conflict in a G7 meeting today (Friday).\n\nLauding the strength and resolve of the international community in supporting Ukraine, as demonstrated by the G7, the Prime Minister will make the case for longer range weapons to be supplied to their armed forces.\n\nHe will tell world leaders that the sophisticated capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and preserve the front line defences. He is also expected to reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine to help in the immediate conflict.\n\nThe capability step change underlines the Prime Minister's push to help Ukraine seize a window of opportunity to push back Russian forces and help Ukraine defend and regain territory for the long term. The Prime Minister raised the possible provision of the longer range weapons with President Zelenksyy during his visit to the UK earlier this month.\n\nThe acceleration comes as Ukraine prepares to mark a year since Russia's barbaric full scale invasion today [FRI]. The Prime Minister will join military personnel in Downing Street, as part of a national moment of reflection at 11am, to pay tribute to the bravery and courage of all the Ukrainians in their fight against Russia.\n\nAlongside the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, the Prime Minister will host members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Downing Street, as well as representatives from the 10 nations supporting the Government's Interflex training programme, including trainers from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland.\n\nJoined by his wife, Akshata Murty, the Prime Minister will also hang a blue and yellow wreath on the No10 door.\n\nPrime Minster Rishi Sunak said:\n\nAs we mark one year since a full scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country.\n\nI am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\n\nLater in the day, the Prime Minister will tell G7 allies in the virtual meeting that he has been humbled by Ukraine's bravery and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's leadership, and is proud of the united response from international partners, including the G7.\n\nHe is expected to say:\n\nFor Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\n\nThe coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\n\nHis rallying call at the G7 will come as the Foreign Secretary speaks at the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York today to call on countries to step up their support for Ukraine to help the country secure a lasting peace on their terms.\n\nHe will set out how Russia's continued targeting of Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, and key agricultural sites, has exacerbated global food prices and hurt the most vulnerable.",

                    "body": "MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 24th February, 2023) UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will urge G7 leaders during a virtual meeting on Friday to \"move faster\" with arms deliveries to Ukraine, including artillery, heavy armor, and air defense systems, according to Sunak's extracts released by No 10 on Thursday.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield... This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence,\" Sunak will tell the G7 meeting, as quoted by The Guardian.\n\nAccording to extracts, \"the coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine;\" therefore, \"now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that US President Joe Biden will meet virtually with G7 leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday morning to discuss continued support for Ukraine.\n\nThe United States and G7 nations on Friday are also set to release a new round of sanctions on Russia, focused on addressing alleged sanctions evasion. The actions come on the one-year anniversary of the launch of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine.\n\nWestern countries have been supplying Ukraine with various types of weapon systems, including air defense missiles, multiple launch rocket systems, tanks, self-propelled artillery, and anti-aircraft guns since Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine a year ago. In late January, Germany committed to sending 14 Leopard 2A6 tanks to Kiev, with other states announcing similar steps or promising to chip in.\n\nIn February, Ukraine's government also started negotiations with its allies on the supply of longer-range missiles and jets to prepare for a counter-offensive. The Kremlin has repeatedly warned against further escalation that could lead to the direct involvement of the US and NATO in the conflict.",

Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" he is expected to say in a virtual meeting a year on from Russia's invasion.\n\nThe UK is due to hold a minute's silence at 11:00 am (1100 GMT) to mark the first anniversary of the conflict.\n\nSunak will join military personnel in observing the national moment of reflection at his Downing Street office, a statement said.\n\nAlongside the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, he will also host Ukrainian armed forces personnel and representatives of 10 nations supporting the government's programme to provide them with extra military training.\n\nSunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, will also hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door to his office at No 10 Downing Street, the statement added.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" he said in the statement.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict.\"\n\nIn his comments to G7 allies, Sunak is expected to add that while the coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, they will also be hard for Russia.\n\n\"They are overreaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward,\" he will say.\n\nAfter the US, the UK has been the biggest donor of aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt was the first to pledge heavy tanks to Kyiv but has so far resisted sending fighter jets.",

                    "body": "Rishi Sunak is to urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" to arm Ukraine's troops as he leads a minute's silence on the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.\n\nThe prime minister is expected to use a G7 meeting on Friday to call on allies to supply longer-range weapons to Ukraine as there is an urgent need for Kyiv to gain a \"decisive advantage\" on the battlefield.\n\nMr Sunak will lead the UK in a minute's silence at 11am to mark the anniversary in front of the Downing Street door.\n\nHe will be joined by the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and representatives from each of the 11 nations that are part of the British-led Ukrainian troop training programme, Operation Interflex.\n\nUN demands Russia withdraw troops - Ukraine war latest\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell G7 leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are overreaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nMr Sunak will also reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine as he and his wife, Akshata Murty, hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of Number 10.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on Western countries to send fighter jets to Ukraine and while the UK has announced training for Ukrainian pilots on NATO-standard jets it has not sent any planes.\n\nFormer PM Boris Johnson has joined those calls and told Sky News on Thursday the UK needs to \"break the ice\" by becoming the first country to supply Ukraine with the aircraft.\n\nBut so far, neither Mr Sunak or his defence secretary Ben Wallace have not made a steadfast commitment to do so.\n\nSky News exclusively reported on Thursday the Treasury has signalled there is no new money for defence, despite recognising the urgent need to rearm in the wake of the war.\n\nAs things stand, the British army would run out of ammunition within a few days if called upon to fight and would take up to 10 years to field a modern warfighting division of some 25,000 to 30,000 troops.\n\nRead more:\n\nPM has 'no interest in defence' as UK ammo stockpiles proved 'inadequate' by war\n\nUkraine war: The race to rearm could decide who wins the conflict\n\nBritish prisoner of war in Ukraine reveals Russian torture methods\n\nOn the eve of the anniversary, Mr Sunak said: \"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict.\n\n\"As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who met Mr Zelenskyy in Kyiv recently, said the UK's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nHe said his party stands \"in lockstep with the government\" in continuing support to Ukraine \"regardless of what other political disagreements we may have\".",

PM tells Zelensky nothing off table after jet plea\n\nThe conflict, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February last year, has seen at least 100,000 of each side's soldiers killed or injured, according to the US military.\n\nLoad Error\n\nThousands of civilians have also been killed, with more than 13 million people made refugees abroad or displaced within Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has been urging its Western backers to increase support, as Russia mobilises ahead of an expected spring offensive.\n\nDuring the virtual meeting of leaders from the G7 group of advanced economies, Mr Sunak is expected to say an acceleration in support is \"what it will take to shift Putin's mindset\".\n\n\"This must be our priority now,\" he will add. \"Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\"\n\nHe is expected to make the argument for supplying Ukraine with \"longer-range weapons\" to disrupt Russia's ability to target Ukraine's infrastructure, something to which he committed the UK earlier this month.\n\n\u00a9 BBC\n\nDuring a recent tour of Europe, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky increased his calls for Western nations to supply his country with modern fighter jets.\n\nThe UK is to start training Ukrainian forces to fly Nato-standard jets. But like other Western nations, it has so far not supplied jets, saying it remains a long-term option.\n\nAlthough support for Ukraine has united the UK's main political parties, Mr Sunak has faced pressure from some of his own Conservative MPs to supply fast jets as soon as possible.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was in office when Russia invaded and is among those urging faster action on jets, used the anniversary to repeat his call to give President Zelensky weapons \"to finish the job\".\n\n\"The last year has taught us that sooner or later, the West gives the Ukrainians what they need,\" he said in a statement released to journalists.\n\n\"And if that is the choice - sooner or later - let's make it sooner, for the sake of Ukraine and the world.\"\n\n'Acts of heroism'\n\nAs he marked the anniversary, Sir Keir said UK parties should continue the unity they had shown during the war so far in the coming months.\n\n\"The resolve and the bravery of the Ukrainian people, supported by their allies across the world, has doomed Putin's barbaric invasion to failure,\" he said.\n\n\"We should take inspiration from their courage and resolve to double down on our support for them.\n\n\"Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight\".\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey paid tribute to the \"amazing acts of heroism in Ukraine\" and said the UK would \"stand in solidarity with Ukraine until they achieve victory\".\n\nIn a letter to Ukrainians in Scotland to mark the anniversary, SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wished a \"speedy victory for Ukraine\".\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "Rishi Sunak will use the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming the country's troops.\n\nAfter 12 months of conflict, the Prime Minister is expected to use a G7 meeting on Friday to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Ukraine, stressing the urgent need for Kyiv to gain a \"decisive advantage\" on the battlefield.\n\nThe UK will hold a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary, amid fears that the war could drag on for at least another year.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell G7 leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister, with his wife Akshata Murty, is also expected to hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country\", he said.\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv and President Volodymyr Zelensky, with Mr Sunak announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nMr Zelensky's call for jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies, although the UK has announced training for Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, as he marked the anniversary, said that the UK's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"The resolve and the bravery of the Ukrainian people, supported by their allies across the world, has doomed Putin's barbaric invasion to failure. We should take inspiration from their courage and resolve to double down on our support for them.\n\n\"When I visited President Zelensky in Kyiv recently, I was deeply moved by the way people there are continuing with their lives. Despite the appalling suffering being inflicted upon them, they remain steadfast and united.\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" he is expected to say in a virtual meeting a year on from Russia's invasion.\n\nThe UK is due to hold a minute's silence at 11:00 am (1100 GMT) to mark the first anniversary of the conflict.\n\nSunak will join military personnel in observing the national moment of reflection at his Downing Street office, a statement said.\n\nAlongside the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, he will also host Ukrainian armed forces personnel and representatives of 10 nations supporting the government's programme to provide them with extra military training.\n\nSunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, will also hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door to his office at No 10 Downing Street, the statement added.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country,\" he said in the statement.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict.\"\n\nIn his comments to G7 allies, Sunak is expected to add that while the coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, they will also be hard for Russia.\n\n\"They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward,\" he will say.\n\nAfter the US, the UK has been the biggest donor of aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt was the first to pledge heavy tanks to Kyiv but has so far resisted sending fighter jets.",

                    "body": "Rishi Sunak will use the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming the country's troops.\n\nAfter 12 months of conflict, the Prime Minister is expected to use a G7 meeting on Friday to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Ukraine, stressing the urgent need for Kyiv to gain a \"decisive advantage\" on the battlefield.\n\nThe UK will hold a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary, amid fears that the war could drag on for at least another year.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell G7 leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nAs we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country\n\nMr Sunak, who will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will also reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister, with his wife Akshata Murty, is also expected to hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country\", he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv and President Volodymyr Zelensky, with Mr Sunak announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nMr Zelensky's call for jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies, although the UK has announced training for Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, as he marked the anniversary, said that the UK's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"The resolve and the bravery of the Ukrainian people, supported by their allies across the world, has doomed Putin's barbaric invasion to failure. We should take inspiration from their courage and resolve to double down on our support for them.\n\n\"When I visited President Zelensky in Kyiv recently, I was deeply moved by the way people there are continuing with their lives. Despite the appalling suffering being inflicted upon them, they remain steadfast and united.\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

                    "body": "Rishi Sunak will use the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to urge fellow world leaders to 'move faster' in arming its troops.\n\nRishi Sunak will use the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming the country's troops.\n\nAfter 12 months of conflict, the Prime Minister is expected to use a G7 meeting on Friday to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Ukraine, stressing the urgent need for Kyiv to gain a \"decisive advantage\" on the battlefield.\n\nThe UK will hold a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary, amid fears that the war could drag on for at least another year.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell G7 leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister, with his wife Akshata Murty, is also expected to hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country\", he said.\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv and President Volodymyr Zelensky, with Mr Sunak announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nMr Zelensky's call for jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies, although the UK has announced training for Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, as he marked the anniversary, said that the UK's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"The resolve and the bravery of the Ukrainian people, supported by their allies across the world, has doomed Putin's barbaric invasion to failure. We should take inspiration from their courage and resolve to double down on our support for them.\n\n\"When I visited President Zelensky in Kyiv recently, I was deeply moved by the way people there are continuing with their lives. Despite the appalling suffering being inflicted upon them, they remain steadfast and united.\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

                    "body": "The Prime Minister is due to use a G7 meeting on the anniversary to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Ukraine to defend itself, stressing the urgent need for Kyiv to gain a \"decisive advantage\" on the battlefield to end the war.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is set to tell G7 leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nMr Sunak, who will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will also reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine.\n\nThe UK is a prominent supporter of Kyiv and President Volodymyr Zelensky, with Mr Sunak announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces. Other Western nations have also promised tanks and other heavy weapons.\n\nBut Mr Zelensky has urged more support including fighter jets but this call has so far been met with reluctance by western allies amid fears of escalating the conflict, although the UK has announced training for Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets.\n\nPressure was ramped up on the PM to do more on jets on Thursday when Boris Johnson said the UK should \"break the ice\" and send RAF Typhoons to the government in Kyiv.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News, Mr Johnson said: \"What the Ukrainians want is F16s. We don't have F16s. We do have Typhoons. I think there is an argument for the UK breaking the ice and giving them some Typhoons.\"\n\nAs part of events to mark the anniversary on Friday the UK will hold a national minute's silence. The Prime Minister, with his wife Akshata Murty, is also expected to hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10.\n\nOn Thursday evening a vigil was held in Trafalgar Square. Events were held around the world, with the Eiffel Tower lit in blue to show solidarity for the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country\", Mr Sunak said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nThe US government will announce \"sweeping\" new sanctions against Russia on Friday \"against key sectors that generate revenue\" for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the US president will also meet virtually with his Ukrainian counterpart Mr Zelensky as well as the G7 leaders.\n\nEuropean Union countries on Thursday failed to agree on a new set of sanctions, missing a planned deadline to have them in place for the one-year anniversary. Representatives of the member states were due to meet again at 9am on Friday to try seal a deal, according to sources.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly for a resolution calling for Russia to end hostilities and withdraw from Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky said his country \"will prevail\" as he mourned \"all the terror, all the killings\" ahead of the first anniversary.\n\nMr Zelensky took to Telegram on Thursday to reflect on the impact of war, saying the memories will \"leave deep scars in your heart and soul\".\n\nHe said: \"They remind us of the path we have gone [on] from February to February.We have overcome many ordeals and we will prevail.\n\n\"We will hold to account all those who brought this evil, this war to our land. All the terror, all the killings, all the torture, all the looting.\n\nEarlier the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step.\n\nThe announcement came days after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned China of consequences if it provided material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMr Stoltenberg said the war in Ukraine must bring an end to \"a cycle of Russian aggression\" that goes back much further than the invasion Moscow launched a year ago.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters , Mr Stoltenberg said the invasion was part of a pattern that included Russian military action in Georgia in 2008 and Donbas and Crimea in Ukraine in 2014.\n\n\"We don't know when the war will end. But what we do know is that when the war ends, we need to ensure that history doesn't repeat itself,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to ensure that we break the cycle of Russian aggression. We need to prevent Russia from chipping away at European security,\" he told Reuters.\n\nChina told the United Nations on Thursday that one year into the Ukraine war \"brutal facts offer an ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace,\" just days after the United States and NATO warned Beijing against giving Russia military support.\n\n\"Adding fuel to the fire will only exacerbate tensions. Prolonging and expanding the conflict will only make ordinary people pay an even heftier price,\" China's deputy UN Ambassador Dai Bing told the UN General Assembly.",

I think there's an argument for the UK breaking the ice and giving them some Typhoons. If it's a question of training people up to use those machines - we can do that.\"\n\nIn a lengthy interview, Johnson said it would be a \"historic mistake\" if China were to supply Russia with any weaponry, saying: \"Why does China want to be contaminated by association with Putin, who has revealed himself to be this gangster and adventurer?\"\n\nIn his necessarily more constrained comments released before the anniversary, Sunak called for greater international efforts to assist Ukraine, while giving few details.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield,\" he was to tell G7 leaders, according to extracts released by No 10. \"This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour and air defence.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are overreaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nAt Downing Street on Thursday evening, Sunak was hosting the Ukrainian ambassador, Vadym Prystaiko, as well as military personnel from 10 nations involved in Operation Interflex, a mass effort to train Ukrainian forces.\n\nIn New York, as well as addressing the security council, Cleverly was due to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, as well as Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general.\n\n\"When Putin invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, he expected his brutal assault to succeed and international support to crumble within weeks. He has been proved gravely wrong,\" Cleverly was to tell the security council.\n\n\"Ukraine is turning the tide and Putin is losing. One year into this terrible war, our support will continue for as long as it takes.\"\n\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, marked the anniversary by saying UK support for Ukraine \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"When I visited President Zelenskiy in Kyiv recently, I was deeply moved by the way people there are continuing with their lives,\" he said. \"Despite the appalling suffering being inflicted upon them, they remain steadfast and united.\"",

                    "body": "ishi Sunak will use the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming the country's troops.\n\nAfter 12 months of conflict, the Prime Minister is expected to use a G7 meeting on Friday to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Ukraine, stressing the urgent need for Kyiv to gain a \"decisive advantage\" on the battlefield.\n\nThe UK will hold a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary, amid fears that the war could drag on for at least another year.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell G7 leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nMr Sunak, who will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will also reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister, with his wife Akshata Murty, is also expected to hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country\", he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv and President Volodymyr Zelensky, with Mr Sunak announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nMr Zelensky's call for jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies, although the UK has announced training for Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, as he marked the anniversary, said that the UK's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"The resolve and the bravery of the Ukrainian people, supported by their allies across the world, has doomed Putin's barbaric invasion to failure. We should take inspiration from their courage and resolve to double down on our support for them.\n\n\"When I visited President Zelensky in Kyiv recently, I was deeply moved by the way people there are continuing with their lives. Despite the appalling suffering being inflicted upon them, they remain steadfast and united.\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

                    "body": "Rishi Sunak will use the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to urge fellow world leaders to 'move faster' in arming its troops.\n\nRishi Sunak will use the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to urge fellow world leaders to \"move faster\" in arming the country's troops.\n\nAfter 12 months of conflict, the Prime Minister is expected to use a G7 meeting on Friday to urge allies to supply longer-range weapons to Ukraine, stressing the urgent need for Kyiv to gain a \"decisive advantage\" on the battlefield.\n\nThe UK will hold a national minute's silence to mark the anniversary, amid fears that the war could drag on for at least another year.\n\n\"For Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence,\" Mr Sunak is expected to tell G7 leaders in a virtual meeting.\n\n\"The coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia. They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nMr Sunak, who will host members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street as well as ambassador Vadym Prystaiko, will also reiterate his offer of UK support to countries able to provide jets to Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister, with his wife Akshata Murty, is also expected to hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country\", he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nThe UK remains a prominent supporter of Kyiv and President Volodymyr Zelensky, with Mr Sunak announcing earlier this year that Britain would be the first country to supply tanks to its armed forces.\n\nMr Zelensky's call for jets has so far been met with reluctance by western allies, although the UK has announced training for Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, as he marked the anniversary, said that the UK's support \"is as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\nThe Labour leader met with Mr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital recently.\n\nHe said: \"The resolve and the bravery of the Ukrainian people, supported by their allies across the world, has doomed Putin's barbaric invasion to failure. We should take inspiration from their courage and resolve to double down on our support for them.\n\n\"When I visited President Zelensky in Kyiv recently, I was deeply moved by the way people there are continuing with their lives. Despite the appalling suffering being inflicted upon them, they remain steadfast and united.\n\n\"As we mark this solemn anniversary and look ahead to the coming months, we must do the same. Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the Government on this issue.\n\n\"No one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"",

                    "body": "The prime minister will host ambassador Vadym Prystaiko and members of the Ukrainian armed forces in Downing Street on Thursday to mark 365 days since Vladimir Putin's grinding war of attrition began.\n\nIn a virtual meeting with fellow G7 leaders, Mr Sunak will warn that \"for Ukraine to win this war - and to accelerate that day - they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield\".\n\n\"That is what it will take to shift Putin's mindset. This must be our priority now,\" he will say. \"Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\"\n\nWith both sides hoping for major breakthroughs in the weeks ahead after a bloody but largely stagnant winter on the frontline, Mr Sunak will warn that the \"coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia.\n\n\"They are over-reaching once again. So now is the time to support Ukraine's plan to re-arm, regroup, and push forward.\"\n\nBritain was the first Western nation to commit to providing its main battle tanks, the Challenger 2, and has said that it will assist allies who wish to answer president Volodymyr Zelensky's new pleas for fighter jets, and will train Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard jets.\n\nOn the anniversary of Russia's invasion, Mr Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty are also expected to hang a blue and yellow wreath on the door of No 10, while the UK will hold a national minute's silence.\n\n\"As we mark one year since a full-scale war broke out on our continent, I urge everyone to reflect on the courage and bravery of our Ukrainian friends who, every hour since, have fought heroically for their country\", he said.\n\n\"I am proud that the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine through this horrific conflict. As I stand with brave Ukrainian soldiers outside Downing Street today, my thoughts will be with all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend freedom and return peace to Europe.\"\n\nAlso marking the anniversary, shortly after meeting with Mr Zelensky in Kyiv, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK's support was \"as firm and unstinting today as it was on that dark day one year ago\".\n\n\"The resolve and the bravery of the Ukrainian people, supported by their allies across the world, has doomed Putin's barbaric invasion to failure. We should take inspiration from their courage and resolve to double down on our support for them,\" Sir Keir said.\n\nHe added: \"Regardless of what other political disagreements we may have, we stand in lockstep with the government on this issue.\n\n\"No one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our Nato allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"\n\nTheir comments come as Ukraine's leading war crimes prosecutor Yuriy Belousov told The Independent that he believed more than 100,000 Ukrainians have been killed so far - far more than the UN's latest estimate of 8,000, which it acknowledges is a significant undercount.\n\n\"There could be 100,000 civilians killed across Ukraine, whose bodies will have to be found and identified once occupied territory is liberated,\" Mr Belousov said.",
