                    "body": "FAIRMONT, W.Va. (Tribune News Service) -- High school students from across the Mountain State poured into school auditoriums, libraries, and classrooms, Wednesday awaiting a call from Sen. Joe Manchin.\n\nSmall squares depicting crowded rooms in nearly every West Virginia public school filled the screen of a video call, their faces only supplanted when the Senator himself joined.\n\nManchin hosted the video call to familiarize students with United States service academies, and introduce them to the process of applying to -- and, hopefully, being selected by -- these schools after graduation.\n\nLocated across the country, service academies are federal institutions that educate undergraduate students and prepare them for careers of military service. To attend these schools, students must receive approval from state officials including Manchin or other member of Congress representing West Virginia.\n\nThe session began with a series of videos explaining the service academy application process from members of Manchin's staff. Then, once Manchin joined the call, a student representative from each school present introduced themselves and the institution they represented.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone, each of the schools that have joined today,\" Manchin said during the call. \"This is the best part of my day, the brightest spot I've had in Washington for a long time.\"\n\nThroughout his speech to the students, Manchin expressed the importance of military service, and the value of an education at a U.S. service academy.\n\nManchin underscored \"the opportunities and the skillset that you receive getting your education that you can attain free with the government because of the service you're giving to your country.\"\n\n\"The people in uniform today are the glue for our country. It holds us together,\" he said. \"It's the people that are willing to put their life on the line for you and me and the great country they serve.\"\n\nManchin then took questions from select students present on the video call.\n\nEli Campbell, a senior at Princeton High School, asked Manchin what qualities make an applicant stand out when applying to service academies.\n\nManchin replied that servant leadership, excellent conduct, and the ability to learn from moments of failure make for an ideal service academy student.\n\nCody Blosser, a senior at Mountaineer Challenge Academy, asked Manchin how valuable he feels it is for service academy alums to serve in the armed forces. Manchin described those who attend service academies as a \"major contribution\" to the U.S. military.\n\n\"Leadership begins in your communities, through lessons learned in the classroom. That's what you're doing now,\" Manchin said.\n\n\"The more things you do for others,\" the \"stronger\" you are as an individual, he added.\n\nManchin also has set aside part of U.S. Senate website dedicated to educating youth about the service academies.",

                    "body": "\"You guys think I'm scared of a motion to vacate. Go [expletive] ahead and do it. I'm not scared,\" McCarthy told the House GOP conference in a closed-door meeting Thursday morning, according to a lawmaker in attendance who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private remarks. Several lawmakers and aides recalled that McCarthy told lawmakers to move or file \"a [expletive] motion\" to oust him.\n\nA motion to vacate would launch the process that could remove McCarthy from the speakership.\n\nLawmakers reacted enthusiastically to McCarthy's defiance, because a majority of the conference continues to support him as speaker. But with Republicans having a razor-thin margin as the House majority, even a small group of far-right antagonists could succeed in removing McCarthy from the speakership if all Democrats voted to remove him, although there is no indication that Democrats are entertaining that idea.\n\nMcCarthy's comments underscore tensions within the GOP conference that have plunged the House into chaos this week.\n\nFacing a Sept. 30 deadline, lawmakers appear to be in worse shape to avert a shutdown than they were three days ago. On Tuesday, amid negotiations on a government funding bill, McCarthy unilaterally directed House committees to open an impeachment inquiry into President Biden -- after vowing that an inquiry would be launched only with a full House vote -- in an apparent attempt to satisfy hard-right lawmakers.\n\nThat move did not appear sufficient, however, as members of the House Freedom Caucus and other far-right lawmakers spent Tuesday publicly reiterating that they view McCarthy's decision to launch an impeachment inquiry as a separate matter from earning their support on funding the government and averting a shutdown.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Republicans failed to move ahead with a procedural vote on a typically noncontroversial bill to fund the Defense Department after it became clear they did not have enough votes.\n\nAfter Thursday morning's gathering of the Republican conference, McCarthy appeared upbeat but declined to describe the language he had used or answer whether he thought he had the votes to avoid a motion to vacate.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I think the best thing to happen here is that we're able to get our work done and we don't get into that mess,\" McCarthy told reporters.\n\nSeveral GOP lawmakers emerged from the meeting voicing support for McCarthy, who endured 15 rounds of voting to win the speaker's gavel in January.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, one of McCarthy's staunchest allies in the far-right wing of the conference, told reporters that she no longer was a member of the \"burn-it-all-down caucus,\" referring to the House Freedom Caucus, and saw no reason to oust McCarthy.\n\n\"Kevin McCarthy does not let these little things get underneath the skin. Nothing has come easy for this guy in the last nine months,\" Representative Dusty Johnson, Republican of South Dakota, said. \"Like all of us, he does occasionally get frustrated by how many members, including myself, can be knuckleheads in any given day. But listen, I mean, he understands that he's the right guy at this moment. And he's not going to be dissuaded by the fact that the job's hard.\"\n\nWashington Post\n\nSenator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, is having trouble making a decision about his political future.\n\nDuring a series of private meetings in the Hamptons over Labor Day weekend, Manchin, his wife, Gayle, and their daughter, Heather, grappled with what the senator should do in 2024, according to two people familiar with the meetings who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. One of the meetings was a private sit-down with former president Bill Clinton.\n\nManchin and his family said in the meetings that the senator was considering three options: running for reelection in West Virginia as an independent; running for president as a No Labels candidate; or retiring from politics. Manchin has not decided what path to pursue, but it seemed clear to those he met with that he is likely to leave the Democratic Party if he chooses to stay in politics.\n\nManchin declined to comment through a spokesperson.\n\nIn some of the meetings, Democratic donors strongly urged Manchin to run for reelection in West Virginia, and Manchin said he believed he could win the race but only if he ran as an independent. Manchin has previously said he has considered leaving the Democratic Party, but people familiar with the meetings said Manchin was more adamant than he has been in public about his need to run as an independent to win.\n\nBut Heather Bresch, Manchin's daughter who was the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, is strongly encouraging her father to run for president with the backing of No Labels, a bipartisan group recruiting a Democrat and a Republican to potentially run on a third-party ticket in next year's presidential election. Manchin has long supported No Labels, once serving as an honorary co-chair of the group and headlining a July event sponsored by the group in New Hampshire.\n\nWashington Post\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis and the state's surgeon general are warning residents under age 65 against the new coronavirus booster, going against the advice of federal health officials who have recommended the shots.\n\nIn a call live-streamed on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, DeSantis and Surgeon General Joseph A. Ladapo repeated comments made in a live event last week in Jacksonville, Fla., and argued there isn't enough evidence that the booster's benefits outweigh any risks. \"I will not stand by and let the FDA and CDC use healthy Floridians as guinea pigs for new booster shots that have not been proven to be safe or effective,\" DeSantis said in a statement after the call with Ladapo and other doctors, which opened with the title \"No way FDA.\"\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved a reformulated coronavirus vaccine that targets an omicron subvariant and is cleared for everyone 6 months and older. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its advisers recommended the shots, manufactured by Moderna and by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.\n\nThe CDC recommends that everyone 5 and older receive a single dose of the updated vaccine, which is part of an arsenal of tools the government is using to counter an expected increase in covid-19, influenza and RSV as the weather turns cooler. Experts interviewed by The Washington Post said they would get the shot as soon as possible. Previously vaccinated children 6 months through 4 years should receive one or two doses of the updated Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Unvaccinated children in that age range should receive three doses of the new Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or two doses of the Moderna vaccine.",

Joe Manchin's (D-WV) daughter has urged him to run for president as a third-party candidate under the No Labels ticket, former President Bill Clinton (D) has conveyed fears to Manchin that such a candidacy could help propel former President Donald Trump to the White House, according to a report.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that over Labor Day weekend, Manchin received dueling advice from his daughter, Heather Bresch, and Clinton during conversations in the Hamptons regarding his political future.\n\nHeather is vehemently pushing for her father to run for president of the United States, according to the Post's sources:\n\nBut Heather Bresch, Manchin's daughter who was the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, is strongly encouraging her father to run for president with the backing of No Labels, a bipartisan group recruiting a Democrat and a Republican to potentially run on a third-party ticket in next year's presidential election. Manchin has long supported No Labels, once serving as an honorary co-chair of the group and headlining a July event sponsored by the group in New Hampshire.\n\nDuring a meeting, Clinton expressed worry that Manchin's potential candidacy could hurt the Democrat nominee and help Trump into the White House. For these reasons, he \"aggressively\" cautioned Manchin against launching a third party.\n\n\"Beyond that, Clinton largely listened as the family discussed the various options, one of the people familiar with the conversation said,\" wrote Tyler Pager and Michael Scherer.\n\nAlong with possibly running for president, Manchin's future holds two potential other paths: calling it a career in American politics or running for reelection in West Virginia, where he likely faces an uphill battle against popular Gov. Jim Justice (R-WV).\n\nNotably, a Morning Consult poll in July found that Manchin had the second-worst approval rating of all U.S. Senators, behind only Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Breitbart News reported. Manchin's approval rating registered at 39 percent, while 55 percent of West Virginians disapproved of him.\n\nAccording to the Post, Manchin has been \"adamant\" in private conversations with Democrat donors that he would have to run as an Independent to win reelection as West Virginia turns increasingly red.\n\nAfter Justice filed his intent to run with the Federal Election Commission in April, Manchin released a statement declaring, \"I will win any race I enter,\" spurring conversations around a potential White House bid.\n\nSpeaking at the No Labels forum in New Hampshire in July, Manchin expressed a similar sentiment.\n\n\"I've never been in any race I've ever spoiled. I've been in races to win,\" Manchin said. \"And if I get in a race, I'm going to win.\"",

That is absolutely inaccurate. We never had that conversation period,\" Manchin told host Hoppy Kercheval Thursday on MetroNews \"Talkline.\"\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Manchin said. \"Never even talked about it. We talked in generalities of all the things and challenges that we have in this country and how we can best bring it together. We never got into that.\"\n\nManchin met with Clinton in The Hamptons last weekend.\n\nManchin repeated again Thursday he hasn't made up his mind yet about 2024.\n\n\"I'm considering the best way for me to serve my state and my country. I have made no decisions yet and not planning to do so before the end of the year,\" Manchin said.\n\nHe said he'll continue to have meetings like the one he had with Clinton last weekend.\n\n\"When I get a chance and people are talking about how we best serve and what we would have to do and our greatest concerns and our great challenges -- we have many but have an opportunity to do some great things,\" Manchin said.\n\nManchin said he'll be on the West Coast this weekend for meetings,\n\nHis Senate seat is up next year but some polls have shown he would have a tough time keeping the seat if he runs against Gov. Jim Justice. Manchin has previously said any race he enters he'll win.\n\nManchin admitted he's struggling with the decision about 2024.\n\n\"That's absolutely true because I love my country and I love my state,\" Manchin said.\n\nNo to WVU president\n\nManchin also said on \"Talkline\" Thursday he wanted to put rumors to rest that he is interested in being the president of West Virginia University.\n\n\"I have no interest in serving as university president,\" Manchin, a WVU grad, said. \"I'm going to be there as their biggest cheerleader, Rah, Rah, Rah, every day.\"\n\nManchin said he's supporting current WVU President Gordon Gee and his administration in their current rightsizing of the university.",

                    "body": "Mitt Romney's retirement shines a glaring spotlight on the potentially bleak future of the Senate's ideological center in both parties. If Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema follow him out the door, it will get worse.\n\nManchin, a centrist Democrat, and the Independent Sinema are both still mulling whether to run again. Like Romney, they could be replaced by senators on either end of the ideological spectrum -- almost surely a Republican in Manchin's West Virginia.\n\nAnd as maligned as Romney, Manchin and Sinema are by one party or the other's faithful, the possible 2024 departures of two or three of them would change the Senate, which passed several notable bipartisan deals in the last Congress.\n\n\"You lose the center, you lose the moderates, you're screwed. You really are screwed,\" Manchin said in an interview. \"I'm hoping the voters will wake up.\"\n\nIt had become cliche to bemoan the Senate's increasing partisanship over the past two decades, a period of fewer big bipartisan deals, endless procedural delays and episodes like the GOP's 2016 Supreme Court blockade. Then, for two years under a 50-50 Senate, President Joe Biden found some legislative success by letting the chamber work its will.\n\nA roving bipartisan group started on Covid aid in late 2020 and came together on big issues that had bedeviled previous Congresses: gun safety, same-sex marriage protection, microchip manufacturing and infrastructure investment. Democrats made their fair share of partisan moves, jamming through hundreds of billions in party-line dollars and a massive pandemic aid plan, but the Senate's playing field was also open for centrist maneuvering.\n\nThese days, the House is run by Republicans in no mood to deal, and it's hard for some to see the conditions of 2021 and 2022 returning anytime soon. That alone was enough for Romney to call it quits.\n\n\"That group was so productive. And it was so fun,\" Romney said of his fellow Senate centrists in an interview on Wednesday. \"That little group, I think, is not going to be around. And so, time for new groups to form.\"\n\nEvery few years, the Senate undergoes sweeping changes due to retirements and lost reelection bids. Taken together, over time, they reshape the act of legislating in surprising ways. Some new senators step up to fill the voids, while other efforts disappear. As Romney sees it -- and he's not alone -- the Senate's current referendum on bipartisanship has three others at its \"heart\": Sinema, Manchin and Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a more progressive red-state dealmaker who faces a tough reelection campaign.\n\nShould some or all of them leave Congress next year, it would mark a repeat of the 2014 and 2018 cycles when a drove of red-state Democrats were ousted or retired. The losses of former moderate Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly still sting among the party's red-state survivors.\n\nBut it's not just Democrats. A quintet of deal-making GOP senators retired last year, and some were replaced by more conservative or pugnacious senators.\n\nThat's certainly a possibility when it comes to Romney's seat. Utah could elect an establishment Republican like Gov. Spencer Cox or a combative conservative like Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). Romney said he'll be neutral in the race to replace him but that he doesn't \"think we're going to get someone off the wall.\"\n\nSinema, if she runs, would face a three-way race against Congressional Progressive Caucus member Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and a hard-right Republican like Kari Lake or Blake Masters. If Manchin retires, Democrats would almost certainly cede the seat to the GOP, which faces a primary between Gov. Jim Justice and the more conservative Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.).\n\n\"With the sort of populist phase we're going through right now, you may have fewer [centrists] coming out of primaries,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another bipartisan collaborator.\n\nManchin and Tester's reelection wins in 2018 were impressive given the deep-red hues of their states. There are some other success stories for the centrist crew: Two moderate GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have withstood challenges from a Democrat and Trump-backed Republican, respectively, in the last two cycles.\n\nNow, it's the Democratic caucus' turn. There, some worry that Sinema and Manchin joining Romney in retirement could shrink a centrist group that swelled during the last Congress down to the size of a Senate phone booth, with negative consequences.\n\n\"This place functions the best when you have individuals on both sides of the aisle that are willing to work across the aisle together. And I think that's true for the three of them,\" said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Sinema's home-state colleague.\n\nStill, the legislative filibuster and its 60-vote threshold remain intact -- and that could mean new members step into the bipartisan breach. The question is whether that means collaboration only on essential government functions like keeping the lights on and raising the debt ceiling or whether there's a bipartisan desire to do more.\n\n\"If that gets hollowed out, working across the aisle, nothing will get done. It's not like over in the House, where if you had the majority, you can still push it through,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of GOP leadership who often supports bipartisan compromises. \"I don't know how we function without that, whoever the personalities are.\"\n\nCapito said she did not believe Manchin, Sinema and Romney would all necessarily follow the same path or were coordinating at all: \"It's not a groupthink there. I think they're all [operating with] three separate different ideas and issues as to where they want to go.\"\n\nRomney's decision probably predates Manchin's and Sinema's by months. Manchin is looking at an end-of-year choice, which would be just before his state's January filing deadline. Romney has urged Manchin not to seek the White House on a third-party ticket.\n\n\"I encouraged him not to run [for president]. I tell Joe that in my opinion, him running would only serve to elect Donald Trump,\" Romney said.\n\nSince Sinema is an independent, she faces even less time pressure to decide. She's giving almost nothing away about her thinking; senators of all stripes are unsure of where she stands, despite having close relationships with her.\n\nIn a statement, Sinema spokeswoman Hannah Hurley said that \"Arizonans are sick of career candidates constantly fighting the next election. Kyrsten promised Arizonans she'd be an independent senator who delivers lasting solutions, and that's exactly what she's done.\"\n\nRomney said he's encouraging his friend Sinema to run again, despite his own decision to retire. Both first-termers, their circumstances are otherwise different: Romney is 76 and at the end of his career; Sinema is 47 and could serve in the Senate for decades if she keeps winning.\n\nManchin is 76 and faces by far the most difficult political circumstances of any Democratic incumbent. But as the only game in town for the Democratic Party, he's winning some converts who might not seem like obvious Manchin fans.\n\n\"I really, really like Joe Manchin. He's a good dude. I don't agree with some of his votes, but he's just a good dude,\" said Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), who said he would support Gallego over Sinema if he lived in Arizona. \"He would be a much, much better senator than Gov. Justice.\"",

                    "body": "SCHUMER AI FORUM DRAWS IRE OF BIG TECH FOES IN THE SENATE\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\n\nSanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, still has not indicated whether he intends to run for a fourth term.\n\nThe 82-year-old doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon. Sanders is the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, giving him broad jurisdiction over concerns at the center of his previous campaigns, such as workers' rights, the cost of prescription drugs, and access to healthcare.\n\nHowever, a debate about the age of political leaders has been building for months. It came to the forefront again a couple of weeks ago when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) appeared to freeze for 30 seconds while answering questions from reporters, the second such incident this summer. If Sanders runs again, he will be 89 at the end of his fourth term.\n\nFor now, Sanders and his staff continue to fend off the reelection questions. The Vermont senator has indicated to reporters who ask him that he thinks it is a distraction.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-WV)\n\nThe West Virginia Democrat has still not announced whether he will be running for reelection in 2024 in a ruby red state President Joe Biden lost by 40 points last cycle. Manchin has openly flirted with a third-party run for president in 2024. Weeks ago, he said he was considering changing his party affiliation from Democrat to independent.\n\nBehind closed doors, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has encouraged him to run. Most Democrats recognize Manchin is perhaps the only Democrat who can win a statewide contest in West Virginia, a key to preserving the party's control of the Senate. Manchin recently told the New York Times he would make a decision about his political future by the end of the year. If he intends to run again, he must inform the state by January.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee is eyeing Manchin's seat as a top pickup opportunity next year to flip the Senate from Democratic to GOP control, attempting to frame his position as \"attempts to rewrite history.\"\n\nShould Manchin decide to run, he could face popular Gov. Jim Justice (R-WV) or Rep. Alex Mooney (R-WV), who are currently competing in a Republican primary. A poll last week for the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce showed Justice beating Manchin handily, winning in a hypothetical Senate contest 51% to 38%. The poll also found that Manchin would narrowly lead Mooney 45% to 41%.\n\n\"I still don't think he knows what he is going to do,\" said a former aide of the senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"I think he'll do exactly what he did last time: wait until December or January to make up his mind.\"\n\nManchin has raised $1.3 million during the second quarter and has more than $10 million in the bank. That's more than Justice, who raised $935,035 from 5,526 individual donors, and Mooney, who raised $411,192.76 in the second quarter.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ)\n\nSinema has not yet said if she is running for a second term after leaving the Democratic Party late last year and becoming an independent. She was the first Democrat to win an Arizona seat in 30 years in 2018. She has spent most of the Biden presidency at odds with progressives on filibuster reform, corporate taxes, and other issues.\n\nIf she were to run, she could face a potential three-way race with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), the progressive likely Democratic nominee who announced his run in January, and Kari Lake, a polarizing conservative who lost her election for governor last year. The state is 34% Republican, 34% independent, and 30% Democratic, according to Arizona data.\n\nLake has not yet launched her bid. If she runs, she will likely face off against Blake Masters, who recently indicated he's preparing to run for the seat held by Sinema. The only Republican in the race so far, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, announced his candidacy in April but is considered an underdog who has yet to raise significant money.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSinema has nearly $10.8 million in her bank account, almost three times more than Gallego. However, Gallego brought in $3.1 million from April 1 through June 30. Lamb reported raising $608,000 in the second quarter.\n\nMcConnell in May indicated Republicans are still assessing the Arizona Senate race and voiced some hesitation about whether the GOP wants to invest resources. In an interview with CNN in May, he emphasized that Republicans will likely wait to see what happens in the primary before they decide to engage.",

                    "body": "West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin is likely going to leave the Democratic Party if he runs for office in 2024, The Washington Post reported Thursday.\n\nManchin hasn't announced a run for reelection, where he would face stiff opposition from Republicans in the predominately red state, and has also teased a third-party run for president. The senator is deciding between three options for next year -- retire from politics, run for reelection as an independent or for president on centrist organization No Labels' ticket, sources familiar with private meetings told the Post.\n\nWhen Manchin, his wife and daughter met with Democratic donors over Labor Day weekend, they told the senator he should run for reelection, according to the Post. Manchin insisted he would only do so as an independent, which he believes would be necessary to win. (RELATED: Here's What West Virginia Dems Think Of Joe Manchin's Political Future In 2024)\n\nRepublican Gov. Jim Justice and GOP Rep. Alex Mooney are vying for their party's nomination to potentially take on Manchin in 2024, and a late May survey from East Carolina University suggests both would beat the senator in a general. Another poll from Research America released Sept. 1 indicates Manchin has a 4-point lead over Mooney, but would lose to Justice, the GOP primary frontrunner, by 13 points.\n\nThe senator also privately met with former President Bill Clinton, who advised Manchin not to run for president, citing similar concerns from other Democrats that it could allow for former President Donald Trump, the clear frontrunner for the Republican primary, to secure a win against President Joe Biden, according to the Post.\n\nManchin has already publicly floated departing from the Democrats, and told West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval that he's \"thinking seriously\" about it.\n\n\"I have to have peace of mind, basically. The brand has become so bad. The D brand and R brand ... You've heard me say a million times, I am not a Washington Democrat,\" said Manchin. \"I've been thinking about that for quite some time. I haven't made any decisions whatsoever on any of my political direction. I want to make sure that my voice is truly an independent voice.\"\n\nManchin served in both chambers of the state legislature in the 1980s and 1990s prior to his time as secretary of state, according to Ballotpedia. The senator went on to complete two terms as governor before being elected to the upper chamber in a special election in 2010, and the election 2018 was his most narrow victory against a Republican opponent by only 3.3 points.\n\nManchin declined to comment, and neither Clinton nor No Labels immediately responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation's requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

                    "body": "Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) is having trouble making a decision about his political future.\n\nDuring a series of private meetings in the Hamptons over Labor Day weekend, Manchin, his wife, Gayle, and their daughter, Heather, grappled with what the senator should do in 2024, according to two people familiar with the meetings who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. One of the meetings was a private sit-down with former president Bill Clinton.\n\nManchin and his family said in the meetings that the senator was considering three options: running for reelection in West Virginia as an independent, running for president as a No Labels candidate or retiring from politics. Manchin has not decided what path to pursue, but it seemed clear to those he met with that he is likely to leave the Democratic Party if he chooses to stay in politics.\n\nManchin declined to comment through a spokesperson.\n\nIn some of the meetings, Democratic donors strongly urged Manchin to run for reelection in West Virginia, and Manchin said he believed he could win the race but only if he ran as an independent. Manchin has previously said he has considered leaving the Democratic Party, but people familiar with the meetings said Manchin was more adamant than he has been in public about his need to run as an independent to win.\n\nBut Heather Bresch, Manchin's daughter who was the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, is strongly encouraging her father to run for president with the backing of No Labels, a bipartisan group recruiting a Democrat and a Republican to potentially run on a third-party ticket in next year's presidential election. Manchin has long supported No Labels, once serving as an honorary co-chair of the group and headlining a July event sponsored by the group in New Hampshire.\n\nManchin has not ruled out a run for president and has supported No Labels' message and proposition. No Labels declined to comment.\n\n\"We're here to make sure that the American people have an option,\" Manchin said at the No Labels event he headlined in July. \"And the option is, can you move the political parties off their respective sides? They've gone too far right, too far left.\"\n\nIn his meeting with Manchin, Clinton made an aggressive pitch that Manchin should absolutely not run for president, warning that his candidacy would only serve to bolster former president Donald Trump, the current front-runner for the Republican nomination. Beyond that, Clinton largely listened as the family discussed the various options, one of the people familiar with the conversation said.\n\nManchin requested the meeting with Clinton after the senator heard the former president was in the Hamptons at the same time, the person said. Clinton often vacations with his family in the Hamptons, and he and Manchin have been in contact over the years. White House officials had asked Clinton to call Manchin when he was debating whether to support important pieces of legislation earlier in Biden's presidency.\n\nClinton's office declined to comment.\n\nManchin has served in the Senate since 2010 after his tenure as governor of West Virginia, and he won his last election by just over three points. If he chooses to run for reelection, he is likely to face stiff competition. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) and Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) are both running for the Republican nomination in a state Trump won by nearly 40 points in 2020. Manchin has said he is not considering running for governor of West Virginia again.\n\nIn a radio interview with a West Virginia radio station in August, Manchin said he has \"absolutely\" considered becoming an independent.\n\n\"I'm thinking seriously what's best for me; I have to have peace of mind, basically,\" he said about the decision. \"I've been thinking about that for quite some time.\"\n\nIf Manchin decides to leave the party, he would become the second Democrat to do so in the last year. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) announced in December that she was becoming an independent, though she has not publicly declared whether she will run for reelection in 2024. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) is running for the seat as a Democrat.\n\nDemocrats are optimistic Manchin will run for reelection in West Virginia, and even if he chooses to run as an independent, most expect the party will back his campaign.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee declined to comment. A national Democratic aide working on Senate races, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the \"party hopes he runs.\"\n\nFor the first two years of Biden's presidency, when the Senate was split 50-50, Manchin held outsize influence over policy and personnel matters. He shaped the Inflation Reduction Act, one of Biden's signature domestic policy accomplishments, after he torpedoed the Build Back Better Act, a more expansive version of the legislation he ultimately agreed to. In recent months, though, Manchin has ratcheted up his criticism of the Biden administration and has opposed an increasing number of Biden nominees. He has been especially angered by the administration's approach in implementing the Inflation Reduction Act and its climate and energy provisions.\n\nStill Democrats acknowledge that if Manchin does not run for reelection, a Republican is almost certainly going to win the Senate seat, and in the last Congress, Manchin voted with the president nearly 88 percent of the time.\n\n\"I believe he has as good a chance as anyone to win reelection as senator in West Virginia,\" said Manchin ally Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. \"He has been as good as senator as anyone in West Virginia. He also has a huge role in the United States in the position that he is in. His influence led to the final passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. So I think that the role he plays in the Senate gives him tremendous clout for his state and for the U.S.\"\n\nWeingarten added that she does not think Manchin \"is going to put himself in the position that would in any way hurt Joe Biden's prospects for reelection.\"",

                    "body": "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is still undecided on his political future, despite a looming deadline to run for reelection in 2024 or file to run for the presidency instead. He has been meeting with his family to discuss what he should do, as well as consulting former President Bill Clinton for his perspective.\n\nOver Labor Day weekend, the Washington Post reported 76-year-old Manchin's future was the subject of several meetings with his family in the Hamptons, one of which was a private sit-down meeting with Clinton.\n\nREPUBLICAN THREAT BECOMES REAL FOR BIDEN AFTER IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nThere are reportedly three options on the table for the centrist senator. These include launching a West Virginia reelection campaign but as an independent, joining No Labels to run for president on a third-party ticket, or retiring altogether.\n\nOne thing for sure, according to the report, is that if he chooses to stay in politics, he will probably leave the Democratic Party.\n\nDemocratic donors are apparently pushing the senator to run for reelection in West Virginia, but his daughter, former pharmaceutical CEO Heather Bresch, wants him to seek the presidency via No Labels.\n\nManchin has been open in his support for the organization and its mission. In July, he headlined a town hall for the group in New Hampshire alongside former Utah Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman.\n\nRunning for president is something Clinton was reportedly adamant Manchin should not do. According to the former president, a third-party run from Manchin would give former President Donald Trump an advantage in 2024.\n\nThe meeting with Clinton was not planned. Instead, the West Virginia Democrat had heard that Clinton was in the area at the same time and requested it. The White House had apparently encouraged Clinton to discuss the subject with Manchin when the senator served as an obstacle to President Joe Biden passing certain legislation.\n\nManchin has been something of an annoyance for Senate Democrats, but the party can't afford to lose him and put its advantage in the Senate in jeopardy. Despite Manchin's refusal to announce a reelection campaign, Democratic groups have been cutting ads in West Virginia in support of him, pushing voters to tell him to run.\n\nSign up for free: Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country overnight and the stories to follow throughout the day delivered to your inbox each evening.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

He has said that he will make a decision by the end of 2023.\n\nHis consideration of a presidential run comes as the likely candidates to be nominated by the Republican and Democratic parties are Trump and Biden, respectively. He noted after the No Labels town hall that Biden had been \"pushed too far left.\"\n\n\"We're here to make sure that the American people have an option, and the option is: Can you move the political parties off their respective sides?\" he said during the summer event. \"They've gone too far right and too far left.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNo Labels has said that it only intends to put forth a presidential ticket \"in the event both major parties nominate presidential candidates that the vast majority of Americans don't want.\" So far, the party has gained ballot access in at least 10 states.\n\nManchin could not be reached by the Washington Examiner for comment.\n\nOriginal Location: Manchin had private meeting with Bill Clinton as he toys with challenging Biden and ditching Democrats\n\nWashington Examiner Videos\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

                    "body": "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is still undecided on his political future, despite a looming deadline to run for reelection in 2024 or file to run for the presidency instead. He has been meeting with his family to discuss what he should do, as well as consulting former President Bill Clinton for his perspective.\n\nOver Labor Day weekend, the Washington Post reported 76-year-old Manchin's future was the subject of several meetings with his family in the Hamptons, one of which was a private sit-down meeting with Clinton.\n\nREPUBLICAN THREAT BECOMES REAL FOR BIDEN AFTER IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nThere are reportedly three options on the table for the centrist senator. These include launching a West Virginia reelection campaign but as an independent, joining No Labels to run for president on a third-party ticket, or retiring altogether.\n\nOne thing for sure, according to the report, is that if he chooses to stay in politics, he will probably leave the Democratic Party.\n\nDemocratic donors are apparently pushing the senator to run for reelection in West Virginia, but his daughter, former pharmaceutical CEO Heather Bresch, wants him to seek the presidency via No Labels.\n\nManchin has been open in his support for the organization and its mission. In July, he headlined a town hall for the group in New Hampshire alongside former Utah Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman.\n\nRunning for president is something Clinton was reportedly adamant Manchin should not do. According to the former president, a third-party run from Manchin would give former President Donald Trump an advantage in 2024.\n\nThe meeting with Clinton was not planned. Instead, the West Virginia Democrat had heard that Clinton was in the area at the same time and requested it. The White House had apparently encouraged Clinton to discuss the subject with Manchin when the senator served as an obstacle to President Joe Biden passing certain legislation.\n\nManchin has been something of an annoyance for Senate Democrats, but the party can't afford to lose him and put its advantage in the Senate in jeopardy. Despite Manchin's refusal to announce a reelection campaign, Democratic groups have been cutting ads in West Virginia in support of him, pushing voters to tell him to run.\n\nIf Manchin wants to run for reelection, he must inform the state in January. He has said that he will make a decision by the end of 2023.\n\nHis consideration of a presidential run comes as the likely candidates to be nominated by the Republican and Democratic parties are Trump and Biden, respectively. He noted after the No Labels town hall that Biden had been \"pushed too far left.\"\n\n\"We're here to make sure that the American people have an option, and the option is: Can you move the political parties off their respective sides?\" he said during the summer event. \"They've gone too far right and too far left.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNo Labels has said that it only intends to put forth a presidential ticket \"in the event both major parties nominate presidential candidates that the vast majority of Americans don't want.\" So far, the party has gained ballot access in at least 10 states.\n\nManchin could not be reached by the Washington Examiner for comment.",

                    "body": "Every few years, the Senate undergoes sweeping changes due to retirements and lost reelection bids. Taken together, over time, they reshape the act of legislating in surprising ways. Some new senators step up to fill the voids, while other efforts disappear. As Romney sees it -- and he's not alone -- the Senate's current referendum on bipartisanship has three others at its \"heart\": Sinema, Manchin and Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a more progressive red-state dealmaker who faces a tough reelection campaign.\n\nShould some or all of them leave Congress next year, it would mark a repeat of the 2014 and 2018 cycles when a drove of red-state Democrats were ousted or retired. The losses of former moderate Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly still sting among the party's red-state survivors.\n\nBut it's not just Democrats. A quintet of deal-making GOP senators retired last year, and some were replaced by more conservative or pugnacious senators.\n\nThat's certainly a possibility when it comes to Romney's seat. Utah could elect an establishment Republican like Gov. Spencer Cox or a combative conservative like Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). Romney said he'll be neutral in the race to replace him but that he doesn't \"think we're going to get someone off the wall.\"\n\nSinema, if she runs, would face a three-way race against Congressional Progressive Caucus member Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and a hard-right Republican like Kari Lake or Blake Masters. If Manchin retires, Democrats would almost certainly cede the seat to the GOP, which faces a primary between Gov. Jim Justice and the more conservative Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.).\n\n\"With the sort of populist phase we're going through right now, you may have fewer [centrists] coming out of primaries,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another bipartisan collaborator.\n\nManchin and Tester's reelection wins in 2018 were impressive given the deep-red hues of their states. There are some other success stories for the centrist crew: Two moderate GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have withstood challenges from a Democrat and Trump-backed Republican, respectively, in the last two cycles.\n\nNow, it's the Democratic caucus' turn. There, some worry that Sinema and Manchin joining Romney in retirement could shrink a centrist group that swelled during the last Congress down to the size of a Senate phone booth, with negative consequences.\n\n\"This place functions the best when you have individuals on both sides of the aisle that are willing to work across the aisle together. And I think that's true for the three of them,\" said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Sinema's home-state colleague.\n\nStill, the legislative filibuster and its 60-vote threshold remain intact -- and that could mean new members step into the bipartisan breach. The question is whether that means collaboration only on essential government functions like keeping the lights on and raising the debt ceiling or whether there's a bipartisan desire to do more.\n\n\"If that gets hollowed out, working across the aisle, nothing will get done. It's not like over in the House, where if you had the majority, you can still push it through,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of GOP leadership who often supports bipartisan compromises. \"I don't know how we function without that, whoever the personalities are.\"\n\nCapito said she did not believe Manchin, Sinema and Romney would all necessarily follow the same path or were coordinating at all: \"It's not a groupthink there. I think they're all [operating with] three separate different ideas and issues as to where they want to go.\"\n\nRomney's decision probably predates Manchin's and Sinema's by months. Manchin is looking at an end-of-year choice, which would be just before his state's January filing deadline. Romney has urged Manchin not to seek the White House on a third-party ticket.\n\n\"I encouraged him not to run [for president]. I tell Joe that in my opinion, him running would only serve to elect Donald Trump,\" Romney said.",

                    "body": "West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin is likely going to leave the Democratic Party if he runs for office in 2024, The Washington Post reported Thursday.\n\nManchin hasn't announced a run for reelection, where he would face stiff opposition from Republicans in the predominately red state, and has also teased a third-party run for president. The senator is deciding between three options for next year -- retire from politics, run for reelection as an independent or for president on centrist organization No Labels' ticket, sources familiar with private meetings told the Post.\n\nWhen Manchin, his wife and daughter met with Democratic donors over Labor Day weekend, they told the senator he should run for reelection, according to the Post. Manchin insisted he would only do so as an independent, which he believes would be necessary to win.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jim Justice and GOP Rep. Alex Mooney are vying for their party's nomination to potentially take on Manchin in 2024, and a late May survey from East Carolina University suggests both would beat the senator in a general. Another poll from Research America released Sept. 1 indicates Manchin has a 4-point lead over Mooney, but would lose to Justice, the GOP primary frontrunner, by 13 points.\n\nThe senator also privately met with former President Bill Clinton, who advised Manchin not to run for president, citing similar concerns from other Democrats that it could allow for former President Donald Trump, the clear frontrunner for the Republican primary, to secure a win against President Joe Biden, according to the Post.\n\nManchin has already publicly floated departing from the Democrats, and told West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval that he's \"thinking seriously\" about it.\n\n\"I have to have peace of mind, basically. The brand has become so bad. The D brand and R brand ... You've heard me say a million times, I am not a Washington Democrat,\" said Manchin. \"I've been thinking about that for quite some time. I haven't made any decisions whatsoever on any of my political direction. I want to make sure that my voice is truly an independent voice.\"\n\nManchin served in both chambers of the state legislature in the 1980s and 1990s prior to his time as secretary of state, according to Ballotpedia. The senator went on to complete two terms as governor before being elected to the upper chamber in a special election in 2010, and the election 2018 was his most narrow victory against a Republican opponent by only 3.3 points.\n\nManchin, Clinton and No Labels did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's requests for comment.",

                    "body": "After Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) announced Wednesday that he will retire at the end of his term, questions remain about three undecided incumbent senators up for reelection next year who have not made their plans clear.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) have remained evasive about whether they will run again. While Sanders hails from deep blue Vermont, all eyes are on Manchin and Sinema, whose decisions could determine whether Republicans retake the chamber. Senate Democrats are defending a small two-seat majority.\n\nSCHUMER AI FORUM DRAWS IRE OF BIG TECH FOES IN THE SENATE\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\n\nSanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, still has not indicated whether he intends to run for a fourth term.\n\nThe 82-year-old doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon. Sanders is the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, giving him broad jurisdiction over concerns at the center of his previous campaigns, such as workers' rights, the cost of prescription drugs, and access to healthcare.\n\nHowever, a debate about the age of political leaders has been building for months. It came to the forefront again a couple of weeks ago when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) appeared to freeze for 30 seconds while answering questions from reporters, the second such incident this summer. If Sanders runs again, he will be 89 at the end of his fourth term.\n\nFor now, Sanders and his staff continue to fend off the reelection questions. The Vermont senator has indicated to reporters who ask him that he thinks it is a distraction.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-WV)\n\nThe West Virginia Democrat has still not announced whether he will be running for reelection in 2024 in a ruby red state President Joe Biden lost by 40 points last cycle. Manchin has openly flirted with a third-party run for president in 2024. Weeks ago, he said he was considering changing his party affiliation from Democrat to independent.\n\nBehind closed doors, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has encouraged him to run. Most Democrats recognize Manchin is perhaps the only Democrat who can win a statewide contest in West Virginia, a key to preserving the party's control of the Senate. Manchin recently told the New York Times he would make a decision about his political future by the end of the year. If he intends to run again, he must inform the state by January.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee is eyeing Manchin's seat as a top pickup opportunity next year to flip the Senate from Democratic to GOP control, attempting to frame his position as \"attempts to rewrite history.\"\n\nShould Manchin decide to run, he could face popular Gov. Jim Justice (R-WV) or Rep. Alex Mooney (R-WV), who are currently competing in a Republican primary. A poll last week for the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce showed Justice beating Manchin handily, winning in a hypothetical Senate contest 51% to 38%. The poll also found that Manchin would narrowly lead Mooney 45% to 41%.\n\nSign up for free: Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country overnight and the stories to follow throughout the day delivered to your inbox each evening.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

That's more than Justice, who raised $935,035 from 5,526 individual donors, and Mooney, who raised $411,192.76 in the second quarter.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ)\n\nSinema has not yet said if she is running for a second term after leaving the Democratic Party late last year and becoming an independent. She was the first Democrat to win an Arizona seat in 30 years in 2018. She has spent most of the Biden presidency at odds with progressives on filibuster reform, corporate taxes, and other issues.\n\nIf she were to run, she could face a potential three-way race with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), the progressive likely Democratic nominee who announced his run in January, and Kari Lake, a polarizing conservative who lost her election for governor last year. The state is 34% Republican, 34% independent, and 30% Democratic, according to Arizona data.\n\nLake has not yet launched her bid. If she runs, she will likely face off against Blake Masters, who recently indicated he's preparing to run for the seat held by Sinema. The only Republican in the race so far, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, announced his candidacy in April but is considered an underdog who has yet to raise significant money.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSinema has nearly $10.8 million in her bank account, almost three times more than Gallego. However, Gallego brought in $3.1 million from April 1 through June 30. Lamb reported raising $608,000 in the second quarter.\n\nMcConnell in May indicated Republicans are still assessing the Arizona Senate race and voiced some hesitation about whether the GOP wants to invest resources. In an interview with CNN in May, he emphasized that Republicans will likely wait to see what happens in the primary before they decide to engage.\n\nOriginal Location: And then there were three: The last senators undecided about reelection in 2024\n\nWashington Examiner Videos\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

                    "body": "After Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) announced Wednesday that he will retire at the end of his term, questions remain about three undecided incumbent senators up for reelection next year who have not made their plans clear.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) have remained evasive about whether they will run again. While Sanders hails from deep blue Vermont, all eyes are on Manchin and Sinema, whose decisions could determine whether Republicans retake the chamber. Senate Democrats are defending a small two-seat majority.\n\nSCHUMER AI FORUM DRAWS IRE OF BIG TECH FOES IN THE SENATE\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\n\nSanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, still has not indicated whether he intends to run for a fourth term.\n\nThe 82-year-old doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon. Sanders is the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, giving him broad jurisdiction over concerns at the center of his previous campaigns, such as workers' rights, the cost of prescription drugs, and access to healthcare.\n\nHowever, a debate about the age of political leaders has been building for months. It came to the forefront again a couple of weeks ago when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) appeared to freeze for 30 seconds while answering questions from reporters, the second such incident this summer. If Sanders runs again, he will be 89 at the end of his fourth term.\n\nFor now, Sanders and his staff continue to fend off the reelection questions. The Vermont senator has indicated to reporters who ask him that he thinks it is a distraction.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-WV)\n\nThe West Virginia Democrat has still not announced whether he will be running for reelection in 2024 in a ruby red state President Joe Biden lost by 40 points last cycle. Manchin has openly flirted with a third-party run for president in 2024. Weeks ago, he said he was considering changing his party affiliation from Democrat to independent.\n\nBehind closed doors, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has encouraged him to run. Most Democrats recognize Manchin is perhaps the only Democrat who can win a statewide contest in West Virginia, a key to preserving the party's control of the Senate. Manchin recently told the New York Times he would make a decision about his political future by the end of the year. If he intends to run again, he must inform the state by January.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee is eyeing Manchin's seat as a top pickup opportunity next year to flip the Senate from Democratic to GOP control, attempting to frame his position as \"attempts to rewrite history.\"\n\nShould Manchin decide to run, he could face popular Gov. Jim Justice (R-WV) or Rep. Alex Mooney (R-WV), who are currently competing in a Republican primary. A poll last week for the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce showed Justice beating Manchin handily, winning in a hypothetical Senate contest 51% to 38%. The poll also found that Manchin would narrowly lead Mooney 45% to 41%.\n\n\"I still don't think he knows what he is going to do,\" said a former aide of the senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"I think he'll do exactly what he did last time: wait until December or January to make up his mind.\"\n\nManchin has raised $1.3 million during the second quarter and has more than $10 million in the bank. That's more than Justice, who raised $935,035 from 5,526 individual donors, and Mooney, who raised $411,192.76 in the second quarter.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ)\n\nSinema has not yet said if she is running for a second term after leaving the Democratic Party late last year and becoming an independent. She was the first Democrat to win an Arizona seat in 30 years in 2018. She has spent most of the Biden presidency at odds with progressives on filibuster reform, corporate taxes, and other issues.\n\nIf she were to run, she could face a potential three-way race with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), the progressive likely Democratic nominee who announced his run in January, and Kari Lake, a polarizing conservative who lost her election for governor last year. The state is 34% Republican, 34% independent, and 30% Democratic, according to Arizona data.\n\nLake has not yet launched her bid. If she runs, she will likely face off against Blake Masters, who recently indicated he's preparing to run for the seat held by Sinema. The only Republican in the race so far, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, announced his candidacy in April but is considered an underdog who has yet to raise significant money.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSinema has nearly $10.8 million in her bank account, almost three times more than Gallego. However, Gallego brought in $3.1 million from April 1 through June 30. Lamb reported raising $608,000 in the second quarter.\n\nMcConnell in May indicated Republicans are still assessing the Arizona Senate race and voiced some hesitation about whether the GOP wants to invest resources. In an interview with CNN in May, he emphasized that Republicans will likely wait to see what happens in the primary before they decide to engage.",

                    "title": "Manchin makes tortured calculations about risking a reelection run in Trump country",
                    "body": "CHARLES TOWN, W. Va. -- He's a nuisance to the White House, unapologetically critical of his Democratic Party and increasingly alienated from voters in his home state that has turned bright red.\n\nAnd yet, Republicans know there are no assurances to ousting Sen. Joe Manchin III, despite his ranking as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in 2024.\n\nBut there's no guarantee he'll run. He squeaked through to reelection in 2018. Since then, former President Donald Trump dominated the state in 2020 with a nearly 40-point margin of victory.\n\nMr. Manchin, who insists he is an independent voice and not a \"Washington Democrat,\" also appears out of step with Democratic voters in his state.\n\n\"There are a whole lot of Democrats in this state that think he's too conservative. But I think most of them understand that if it weren't for that, he wouldn't have a chance,\" said John Doyle, president of the Jefferson County Democratic Association and a former longtime West Virginia state lawmaker. \"As long as most Democrats believe he's the best we're gonna get, then they'll support him. He then has free rein to try and persuade as many moderate Republicans as he can.\"\n\nMr. Manchin's 2018 election results in Jefferson County, located in the state's panhandle roughly two hours northwest of Washington, closely resembled his narrow statewide victory. He won reelection in the state by less than 20,000 votes or just 3.3 percentage points.\n\nThis election cycle, Mr. Manchin's seat could have far broader implications: deciding which party controls the chamber. Democrats' one-seat majority means Republicans need a net gain of only one or two seats, depending on whether Democrats retain the White House and the vice president's role as the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.\n\nMr. Manchin says a decision on whether he'll seek another six-year term will come later this year as he flirts with a third-party presidential run and vows an \"unrelenting fight\" against Mr. Biden's landmark tax-and-climate law known as the Inflation Reduction Act. He also provided the key vote needed to pass the tax and climate bill without any GOP support.\n\nHis criticism of his party, a tilt back toward the ideological center and uncertainty about his political future have placed Mr. Manchin in the spotlight. That's why it's obvious he'll run again, Mr. Doyle said.\n\n\"He's just trying to demonstrate he believes that we got to get to the center,\" Mr. Doyle said. \"I agree with him about that.\"\n\nRussell Bissett, a 76-year-old West Virginia Republican who was selling Trump apparel at the recent Jefferson County Fair, said Mr. Manchin leaving the Democratic Party to become an independent could persuade him to vote for Mr. Manchin, despite the senator's work on the Inflation Reduction Act. Mr. Manchin has said he's \"seriously thinking\" about such a move.\n\n\"I might consider him. I like Manchin,\" Mr. Bissett said. \"I don't know him well, but I met him. He seems like a really nice guy. I think he just got screwed [on the Inflation Reduction Act]. ... He should have never believed Biden.\"\n\nAlan Engelberg, a retired physician, is among the West Virginia Democrats who feel Mr. Manchin is too conservative but is the party's only hope for keeping the seat blue.\n\n\"If he's going to be the Democratic nominee and we want to keep the Senate in the right place, I definitely would support him. We would do what we need to to help him,\" Mr. Engelberg said. \"I understand he wants to be as middle of the road as possible. I'm not that much of a middle-of-the-roader. I don't know if he really understands what climate change is all about or what it's doing.\"\n\nA wildcard in the forthcoming race will also be the criminal cases against Mr. Trump. It could boost Republican candidates in ruby-red West Virginia, similar to the increased national support the ex-president has received in the GOP presidential primary, said Jefferson County Republican Executive Committee Chair Steven Roberts.\n\nHe said that a lot of Republican voters think the justice system has been weaponized against Republicans. \"It's basically inspiring a lot of backlash against the current administration,\" Mr. Roberts said.\n\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for Senate, said Mr. Manchin presents a \"formidable candidate for anybody.\"\n\nBut with Mr. Manchin's approval rating underwater, hypothetical matchups show him losing to Mr. Justice.\n\n\"I don't think Joe Manchin will run against me. I think what Joe Manchin wants to do is to punch his ticket,\" Mr. Justice told The Washington Times. \"Joe Manchin wants to run for president as an independent. The fantasy tour won't last long. He'll go out looking like a centrist and can go on a book tour, become a CNN analyst, make a lot of money and fade off into the sunset.\"\n\nHis only election loss came during the 1996 Democratic primary for governor, an office he finally won in 2004.\n\nMr. Manchin told The Times that he's no closer to making a reelection decision but argued representing an increasingly red state \"wouldn't protect\" his GOP opponents, including Mr. Justice.\n\n\"I've had a red state for a long time. I'll make that decision with time, but that wouldn't prevent me [from running],\" Mr. Manchin said. \"It's a wide-open race -- period.\"\n\nAnother potential indicator Mr. Manchin won't retire: He's raised a whopping $10.5 million and had nearly $10.8 million in cash on hand as of the end of June, according to campaign filings with the Federal Elections Commission. Without officially entering the race, Mr. Manchin has raised 5 to 10 times more than his GOP challengers who are actively campaigning.\n\nMr. Justice, a billionaire coal baron, will need to overcome his own vulnerabilities and defeat Rep. Alex Mooney in the primary before duking it out with a Democrat in the general election.\n\nMr. Justice endorsed Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus in 2021, putting him at odds with his party over the behemoth spending package. He didn't vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, when he was a Democrat; and he's created enemies in policy fights with state Republican lawmakers, resulting in roughly 30 state lawmakers endorsing Mr. Mooney for Senate.\n\nMr. Mooney accused Mr. Justice of being nothing more than a Democrat disguised as a Republican. Mr. Mooney is a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and he's backed by the Club for Growth and Trump allies such as Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n\"This man is a tax and spend liberal. He's, frankly, not much different than Joe Manchin. We want to get rid of Joe Manchin, not have a liberal Republican version of Joe Manchin,\" Mr. Mooney told The Times. \"Jim Justice didn't even vote for President Trump in 2016. He ran as a Democrat. Trump won, and then he kind of led with Trump after that for pragmatic purposes.\"\n\nMr. Justice called those assertions \"just plain garbage.\" He underwent a Trump-inspired party flip in 2017 at a rally with the former president and touted his close ties to the Trump family.\n\n\"I strongly believe that President Trump will endorse me,\" Mr. Justice said. \"In my world, he's the king. He's got plenty of time to decide what he wants to do in regard to me.\"\n\nMr. Mooney has raised north of $2 million and had $1.5 million cash on hand at the end of June. Club for Growth and the Rand Paul-aligned Protect Freedom PAC are putting $13.5 million behind Mr. Mooney.\n\nMr. Justice has raised $935,000 and had less than $809,000 in the bank but will receive financial backing from Senate Republicans' fundraising arm. He's self-funded past campaigns but is pledging not to do so in the Senate race.\n\nPast polls have indicated Mr. Manchin would lose to Mr. Justice and beat Mr. Mooney. Non-partisan election forecasters like Inside Elections and Sabato's Crystal Ball give a slight advantage to Republicans picking up the seat, while the Cook Political Report rates it a toss-up.\n\nWest Virginia state Sen. Patricia Rucker, who endorsed Mr. Mooney, emphasized Mr. Manchin won't be easy to topple thanks to the bipartisan admiration he's earned over his decades-long political career.\n\n\"If the Republican [nominee] is someone that voters trust, I think the Republican would beat Joe Manchin. If they don't, then I think Joe Manchin has the chance to beat the Republican,\" said Ms. Rucker. \"The one thing you can say about Manchin -- he's not dishonest. He's someone who says and does what he believes. He's taken very big political risks, and we do appreciate that. But at the end of the day, some of his votes are not things that help West Virginia.\"",
