                    "body": "BAGHDAD: An old adage about Arabic books claims that \"Cairo writes, Beirut prints and Baghdad reads.\" While this might not entirely be the case today, the last part of the famous phrase still holds true -- Iraqis love to read.\n\nBuying, reading and discussing books have long been a crucial part of Iraqi intellectual life that endures to this day, notwithstanding the country's political ups and downs.\n\n\"Books allow us to escape,\" Fatimah Jihad, foreign rights manager for Al-Mada Group for Media, Culture and Art, told Arab News. \"No matter what happens in the country, there is a great desire to keep the culture of books and literature alive.\"\n\nThat is not to say that there have not been great challenges, however.\n\n\"Because of the wars, armed militias and the fighting inside Iraq, literature and education have taken a back seat, with people not as keen to educate themselves and to gain knowledge as they used to be,\" Aqeel Al-Khrayfawee, an Iraqi archaeological researcher and academic, told Arab News.\n\n\"Due to lack of support from the government, the selling, buying and even writing of books has decreased.\"\n\nHowever, a number of mostly privately organized initiatives over the past decade across Iraq have been trying to revive this crucial part of Iraqi heritage at a time when traditional bookstores all around the world are increasingly under threat.\n\nAt the end of last year, Al-Saqi Books, which was London's first Arabic bookstore, closed its doors after 44 years of operation.\n\n\"It's been incredible but we have just had to face the facts and realities of the situation: There were just a few too many challenges,\" Lynn Gaspard, the daughter of one of Al-Saqi's two founders, told Arab News in December.\n\nThat same month, thousands of Iraqis and foreigners flocked to the famed Al-Mutanabbi Street in Baghdad. Named after the Abbassid-era poet Abu Al-Tayeb Al-Mutanabbi, the street has long been renowned for its booksellers, coffee shops and intellectual scene.\n\nThe street, which still bears the scars of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, and a car bomb attack in 2007 that killed 30 people and wounded 60, reopened in December 2021 after it was renovated by the Iraqi Private Banks League.\n\nA year later, bookworms flocked there for the third annual Iraq International Book Fair. It was the largest and most global edition of the event to date, featuring about 800,000 books from 350 Iraqi and international publishers representing 20 countries.\n\nThe fair was organized by Al-Mada Group, and sponsored by the Association of Iraqi Private Banks and the Iraqi Central Bank. Al-Mada is a media and cultural foundation that was founded in Damascus, Syria, with branches in Beirut and Cairo. In 2003 it moved its headquarters to Baghdad and began publishing Al-Mada newspaper.\n\nFASTFACTS\n\nLocated near the old quarter of Baghdad, Al-Mutanabbi Street was the first book traders' market in the Iraqi capital.\n\nIt is named after 10th-century poet Abu Al-Tayeb Al-Mutanabbi, who was born under the Abbasid dynasty.\n\nIt has been a refuge for writers of all faiths and a historic heart and soul of the Baghdad literary and intellectual community.\n\nThe fair was dedicated to the Iraqi philosopher, historian, intellectual and linguist Hadi Al-Alawi (1932-1998), renowned for his studies of Islamic and Arab culture, science, and Chinese and Islamic civilizations. It featured poetry readings, book signings, art exhibitions, and seminars on Iraqi culture and society, and Al-Alawi's creative journey.\n\nThe Iraqis who frequent Al-Mutanabbi Street say that books can safely remain out on display there at night because \"the reader does not steal, and the thief does not read.\" Despite Iraq's numerous woes, literature continues to be a mainstay of the nation's intellectual and cultural life -- and one that Iraqis continue to champion through events such as the book fair.\n\nStill, the uncertain political situation continues to weigh on not just the book-publishing industry but the small and medium enterprises sector in general.\n\nPrime Minister Mohammed Al-Sudani, who took office in October last year, has struggled to deliver on his promises concerning the economy, security, human rights and corruption.\n\nAt the end of January, the wife of the former head of Iraq's tax authority and two other people were arrested on corruption-related charges. Poverty, unemployment, a lack of local industry, and climate inaction continue to affect the country.\n\nAs one of the nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, bureaucratic inaction and inefficiency at the central and provincial levels have contributed to a shortage of even basic necessities such as clean water and electricity in many parts of Iraq.\n\n\"Because of the security situation over the years, we haven't had access to bookstores and publishers from outside of Iraq,\" Ali Tariq, executive director of the Iraqi Private Banks League, told Arab News.\n\n\"Iraqis attend (the book fair) from all over Iraq because it allows them to access international books and books from other Arab countries that are not readily available in Iraq.\n\n\"A fair like this offers a big opportunity for Iraqis to interact with international publishers, especially (those) from the Arab region.\"\n\nOver the past decade, and particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic began, a number of initiatives have been launched across the country encouraging Iraqis, especially the nation's youth, to develop a love of reading.\n\nIn early November, the ninth edition of the \"I Am Iraqi, I Read\" festival was held on the grassy lawns of Abu Nawas Park in Baghdad. About 35,000 books were distributed free of charge, a massive increase from the 3,000 handed out during the first edition in 2012. The festival is staged each year in different provinces throughout the country.\n\nIn 2014, a few months after the liberation of the northern city of Mosul from Daesh, the residents there staged their first reading festival. During the occupation of Iraq's third-largest city, its famous library at Mosul University was bombed and burned down the extremists, an event dubbed \"The Book Massacre of Mosul.\"\n\nThe library, which was established in 1967, was once one of the biggest libraries in Iraq, containing hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts.\n\nIn September 2017, Mosul residents staged a literary festival called \"From the Ashes, the Book Was Born.\" Attendees were asked to bring one book and donate it to the university's library. According to the UN, the event collected more than 6,000 books in one day, helping to restock and rebuild the destroyed library.\n\nBook fairs also take place in other parts of the country, including the southern city of Basra, through the Al-Mada Foundation. In 2021, more than 250 international and Arab publishers took part in the Basra fair, which included a range of cultural activities.\n\n\"A love for literature is part of our roots; Iraqis visit Al-Mutanabbi Street on a regular basis now,\" said Tariq. \"There is a movement now within the population to increase general awareness and emphasize the importance of reading, particularly for the younger population.\"\n\nDespite awareness campaigns, however, funding to help Iraqi writers get their work in print remains scarce.\n\n\"There are many Iraqi writers but there is no budget to publish their books,\" said Al-Khrayfawee, who is also the vice president of the Story Club for the Writers Union of Najaf.\n\n\"Iraqis love literature, history and learning about the culture of other people. It's part of our ancient heritage, like our classical literature and love for poetry.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the many challenges, book fairs and festivals create more opportunities for Iraqi booksellers, writers and publishers, Al-Mada Group's Jihad said, as well as hope of investment from the private sector in the region and beyond.\n\n\"It's a win-win situation,\" she said. \"More and more people attend the fairs each year. We have this culture of reading in Iraq, of buying and selling books.\n\n\"The Iraqi writers, publishers and book sellers meet vendors from around the region and the world. These exchanges create new business. Our hard work is paying off because each year, more Iraqis and international visitors are attending.\"",

                    "body": "James Phillips is a Visiting Fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe House's nonbinding resolution against the Bush Administration's new strategy for Iraq is only the first skirmish in what is likely to be a bitter struggle over the future of U.S. policy in Iraq. Democrats in the House engineered a 246 to 182 vote by crafting a resolution that enabled House members to take a cost-free symbolic stand against President Bush's \"new way forward\" without taking responsibility for proposing a coherent alternative policy. This resolution, a rare rebuke to the nation's commander in chief in a time of war, is the first step in what will be a protracted campaign to hamstring President Bush's Middle East policy and undermine his constitutional authority as commander in chief. At stake is not only the fate of Iraq but also the outcome of the war against terrorism and of U.S. efforts to contain Iran, as well as the ability of future American presidents to fight and win wars.\n\nHouse Democrats already have signaled that they intend to escalate their efforts to block the Administration's plans in Iraq by placing restrictions on the funds and resources needed to implement the Administration's new counterinsurgency strategy. Representative John Murtha (D-PA), chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, has indicated that he will seek to attach conditions to the $93 billion supplemental defense appropriation due to be voted on next month that will make it impossible for the Administration to follow through with its promising new strategy. Murtha intends to legislatively impose restrictions on the deployment of military units to Iraq by stipulating that they must meet certain requirements for equipment, training, and time between deployments. By cynically masking his proposals as efforts to enhance military readiness, Representative Murtha seeks to sabotage the surge strategy.\n\nDemocrats hope to sidestep the charge that they are undermining the troops during wartime by imposing restrictions by legislative fiat, rather than direct cuts to funding. But blocking reinforcements would put the lives of the troops already deployed in Iraq at greater risk. And those troops now in Iraq are likely to face extended deployments if Congress delays the deployment of their replacements. This kind of congressional micromanagement not only undermines the flexibility of the forces available to military commanders and reduces the overall effectiveness of the war effort, but it also impinges on the President's powers as commander in chief. Such legislation could provoke a constitutional clash over presidential war powers.\n\nIf the Democratic-controlled Congress does succeed in choking off the troop reinforcements and resources needed to implement the Bush Administration's Iraq strategy, then it must assume responsibility for the resulting disaster.\n\nBy undercutting the Administration's Iraq policy, Congress risks fatally undermining the Iraqi government, allowing Iraq to slide into a much more bloody sectarian civil war, and handing Iran, Syria, and al-Qaeda a major victory. A rush-to-exit strategy also risks abandoning Iraqis to a humanitarian catastrophe far worse than the murderous ethnic cleansing in the Balkans that led to two U.S. interventions there in the 1990s and even worse than the tragic bloodletting in Darfur today. Pulling the plug on the war in Iraq also will help create the conditions for many future wars. A defeat in Iraq will increase the likelihood that future U.S. military interventions will be needed to combat a resurgent al-Qaeda, contain spillover effects that threaten Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Jordan, and confront an increasingly aggressive Iran.\n\nJames Phillips is Research Fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs in the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, a division of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for International Studies, at The Heritage Foundation.",

                    "body": "On March 20, 2003, having turned a deaf ear to the global opposition, the United States invaded Iraq claiming that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction, offering as proof what was later revealed to be a small tube of detergent. Iraq has endured endless chaos and instability ever since.\n\nThe US invasion led to the deaths of between 180,000 to 210,000 civilians, according to the Iraq Body Count project, which maintains the world's largest public database of violent civilian deaths in the country since the 2003 invasion. The instability and security vacuum caused by the toppling of the Iraqi government and the withdrawal of US forces in 2011 also led to the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\nHence, when US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin landed in Baghdad on Tuesday on an unannounced visit, his message that the US \"will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty\", was a hypocritical repudiation of US culpability.\n\nAfter Iraq, the US has continued its military adventures, including in Libya and Syria. And it is not just the Middle East that has been plunged into turbulence and turmoil by the US' actions. Afghanistan is still roiling from the effects of the US invasion of the country in 2001 and subsequent military occupation and it is also the US' invisible hand that has turned Ukraine into a butcher's block.\n\nTo consolidate its global hegemony and play its zero-sum games, the US has no qualms about meddling in the internal affairs of other countries. Although it does so upholding the banners of democracy and human rights, these are just fig leaves for exercising of its might makes right.\n\nThanks to the US' always calamitous interventions in other countries' affairs, passages of peace and tranquility are rare in any part of the world as they always cause radiating shock waves of turmoil and turbulence.\n\nAs the 20th anniversary of the Iraq War draws near, the world should reflect on what has happened over the past two decades as a result and denounce the US' interventionist policies that continue to wreak havoc in many parts of the world. Not least in Ukraine, where, having gamed the support of its NATO allies, the US is constantly pouring oil on the conflict by providing Kyiv with ever more military aid.\n\nNot content with this, the Joe Biden administration and the strategists in Washington are trying to extend the Ukraine crisis to the Asia-Pacific, as a means to create a hard buffer to halt China's development. On the anniversary of the start of the Iraq War, the rest of the international community should say a resolute \"no more\" to the US and its chauvinist allies.",

                    "body": "Baghdad, Iraq, 08 March 2023- On International Women's Day (IWD), the United Nations family in Iraq renews its commitment to support the rights of women and girls in Iraq, and to advocate for the acceleration of their empowerment as well as the strengthening of gender equality.\n\nTo mark the occasion in Iraq, the Council of Ministers Secretariat (ComSec)/Women Empowerment Directorate, under the auspices of H.E. Prime Minister Mohammed S. al-Sudani and in cooperation with UN agencies, launched a conference in conjunction with the declaration of Baghdad as the Capital of Arab Women for 2023, as decided by the Arab Women's Committee.\n\nAt the conference, the government also launched its National Strategy for Iraqi Women 2023-2030, with special focus on the importance of women's political participation, protection of women and girls, economic empowerment, and climate change. The national strategy is in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1325, constitutional principles of human rights, and the Government of Iraq's priority to empower women.\n\nInternational Women's Day was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly as a global call to recognize the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women, and an opportunity to advocate for their rights and empowerment.\n\nThis year's International Women's Day theme is \"DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality,\" recognizing how a gender-responsive approach to innovation, technology and digital education can help us to collectively achieve the Global Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Advancements in digital technology offer opportunities to address development and humanitarian challenges, including increasing participation of women and girls in leadership and political realms, as well as entrepreneurship.\n\n\"On this occasion, we congratulate Iraqi women for the recent vote by the Council of Ministers to approve the National Strategy for Iraqi Women for the years 2023-2030. The General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers contributed to its formulation and adoption of its axes through the participatory effort of the executive and legislative sectors, local organizations, and supporting international bodies.\"\n\n\"The axes of the strategy focus on advancing the reality of Iraqi women and empowering them in various fields, such as social, political, economic, protection, participation, financial inclusion, and facing climate challenges. The government believes in the active and influential role that women have accomplished and continue to achieve in building state institutions and maturing their democratic experience.\" said Hameed al-Ghizi, Secretary-General of the Cabinet, on behalf of Prime Minister Mohammed Shiaa Al-Sudani and expressed these views.\n\n\"The UN stands with the women and girls of Iraq, and their empowerment is at the heart of our work in this country,\" said Ghulam Isaczai, the United Nations Resident Coordinator for Iraq. \"UN family in Iraq is committed to see Iraqi women enjoy full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic, and public life. To achieve this, we must keep moving forward to ensure the root causes of systemic inequality are addressed, and women and girls are provided with every opportunity to participate in an increasingly digitized world\", he added.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nZainab Salih, Communications Officer, zainab.salih@un.org , 009647901105664",

                    "body": "The case for invading Iraq in March 2003 was built on three basic premises: that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (WMD); that it was developing more of them; and that it was failing to comply with its disarmament obligations under a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions. All of these premises were based on scraps of unreliable information. None of them was true.\n\nDavid Kay was one of the loudest voices outside the United States government advocating a new invasion of Iraq in the years and months leading to the second Gulf War. As a former nuclear inspector who had worked in Iraq in 1991, after the first Gulf War, he became a popular TV pundit and was even called to testify before Congress, talking up dubious claims about new Iraqi WMD programmes.\n\nIt was not surprising, then, that Kay should be chosen to head the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) -- the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) mission to find and disable those putative WMD programmes -- once the US-led multinational coalition had toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime and turned Iraq into an occupied state.\n\nThe ISG found no WMD in Iraq, and returning to Congress to testify on 28 January 2004, Kay admitted 'we were almost all wrong'. He blamed a lack of human agents inside Iraq in the months before the war, and analysts being under pressure to draw conclusions based on inadequate intelligence. True, the intelligence Kay and many others in Washington, DC, London and other capitals had chosen to listen to was inadequate and flawed. But there was plenty more information that they ignored, much of it coming from many weapons inspectors working inside Iraq -- including US nuclear experts -- under UN mandate for four months in 2002-2003.\n\nI was in Iraq in those final months before the 2003 invasion as Deputy for Analysis of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Action Team tasked with the nuclear side of the weapons inspections, while the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) worked in parallel, looking for biological and chemical weapons, as well as illicit missile programmes. We studied a few outstanding questions regarding the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme that had been discovered and dismantled in the early 1990s; we looked for new evidence and investigated leads and suspicions passed on to us by national governments; we inspected many sites and interviewed Iraqi scientists and officials in person; and we analysed the data. By early 2003 we knew at a very high level of confidence that there was no nuclear weapons effort of any kind in Iraq, and we were regularly passing this information back to the UN Security Council. We were not wrong.\n\nI had been an IAEA inspector in Iraq in 1992-93. The UN Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) and the IAEA Action Team carried out hundreds of person-days of inspections in Iraq. We discovered nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programmes and methodically destroyed them -- even to the extent of blowing up entire factories and laboratories and bringing special nuclear materials out of the country. In the 1990s, the US, British, French, German and other governments freely provided excellent intelligence on where to look and what to look for. By 1998, even though Iraq had stopped cooperating with the inspections, there was general agreement that the Iraqi WMD programmes were completely dead, with only a few questions unanswered.\n\nA major turning point in the US approach to Iraq was the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, DC. Al Qaeda, operating from Afghanistan, was identified as the source of the attacks, and the invasion of Afghanistan launched weeks later. The administration of new US President George W. Bush then tried, with very little credible evidence, to link Iraq to the attacks. After intense campaigning led by the USA, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1441, ordering Iraq to immediately allow UNMOVIC and IAEA weapons inspectors back into the country in November of 2002. Aware that the war drums were beating, Iraq complied.\n\nHowever, the Bush administration included many senior policy makers who had no use for the United Nations and made their distaste clear. As the months went by, we watched them repeat stories about Iraqi WMDs and covert WMD programmes that we knew to be false -- and that we had even specifically debunked -- in order to build public and diplomatic support for an invasion.\n\nOne of the most best-known false narratives used to build the case for invasion concerned consignments of and tenders for aluminum tubes. In around 2001, CIA analyst 'Joe' noticed an attempt by Iraq to purchase high-strength aluminium tubes that he suspected could be used in building centrifuges to enrich uranium for weapons. The claims were soon investigated and dismissed within the US Intelligence Community and the subject died. UNSCOM and the IAEA had investigated earlier evidence in the 1990s of identical tubes that were already in Iraq in the thousands. Although they had a vague circumstantial similarity to tubes on export control lists, they were for conventional military use and experts had ruled out that they could be useful for centrifuges.\n\nBut suddenly, in September 2002, the same story leaked to the media and the old allegations were back. Experts from the IAEA, the US National Laboratories and the EU pointed out that the tubes were identical to those used in Italian NATO-standard Medusa air-to-ground rockets that Iraq had started trying to reverse engineer in the 1980s for ground-to-ground use.\n\nAt around this time a friendly source leaked internal CIA correspondence to the IAEA showing that the CIA was completely aware that the tubes matched those used in Medusa rockets. Nevertheless, 'Joe' and his colleagues stuck to the centrifuge story. It was even repeated by President Bush in his January 2003 State of the Union address and by Secretary of State Colin Powell in his infamous February 2003 briefing to the UN Security Council aimed at demonstrating that Iraq was not complying with Resolution 1441 -- one of the most decisive moments in the build-up to war.\n\nOne of several mistakes the CIA made was to only ask the US National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) to comment on whether the tubes could be for an Iraqi rocket. NGIC replied that ground-to-ground rockets did not need such high-specification tubes. They were apparently unaware of Iraq's attempts to copy and repurpose the Medusa design. Had the Air Force Research Laboratory been brought in, it could have identified the tubes as suitable for Medusa rockets.\n\nIn Iraq, the weapons inspectors investigated the story in the field. The IAEA nuclear inspectors educated themselves thoroughly about small rockets. We also gained access from the Iraqis to every aspect of their rocket programme: procurement records, manufacturing, testing and military stockpiles. We thus easily identified the likely true purpose of the tubes -- which was later confirmed by the Iraq Survey Group.\n\nCentrifuges also featured in another piece of misinformation communicated by President Bush during this period. In an address to the nation in October 2002, President Bush showed satellite imagery of a repurposed facility at Al Furat, a former centrifuge manufacturing site from the Iraqi nuclear programme that was dismantled in 1991. He implied that this was evidence that Iraq was rebuilding its nuclear programme, apparently unaware that UNMOVIC had free access to the site and had known for many years that it had been converted to a surface-to-air missile system repair facility. Satellite images could not determine this, but UNMOVIC could. By relying on old information and satellite images, and ignoring the reports of highly qualified eyewitnesses in the field, desk-bound analysts had once again come to an incorrect, but politically useful, conclusion.\n\nKay's lament that there were no human agents recruited in Iraq during the months leading up the war overlooked the fact that the USA and the IAEA put some of the most qualified analysts into the inspection teams. While ignoring the inspectors, the CIA and others in Washington were not only relying on obsolete data but also a few highly unreliable clandestine sources. These included an Iraqi defector, Rafid al-Janabi, known as Curveball. Curveball had been granted asylum by Germany in 2000 and made claims about Iraq having mounted facilities for manufacturing biological weapons in trucks that were moving around the country to escape detection. Germany's federal intelligence service doubted his veracity. Nevertheless, when Germany passed on the source notes, US analysts took Curveballs's stories at face value, without vetting them.\n\nCurveball's distortions were leaked to the public, in some cases by an 'intelligence cell' in the Pentagon staffed by people with no intelligence experience. This cell worked by cherry-picking items from raw intelligence that supported political positions -- particularly Iraq's supposed links to the 11 September attacks and the existence of WMD programmes. Curveball's highly dubious claims were also repeated in Powell's February 2003 Security Council briefing as established fact.\n\nAnother favoured defector source, whose stories leaked to the New York Times in 2001, was Adnan al Haideri. He claimed to have worked on a number of facilities that he believed were to be used for WMD development, in particular painting them with hard epoxy that would be easy to decontaminate. In fact, some of these locations were already known in the early 1990s and had been inspected. Nevertheless, the UN inspectors revisited the sites in 2002 and found them to be harmless.\n\nIt is also worth noting that much of the 'intelligence' favoured by the upper echelons in Washington came from the Iraqi National Congress (INC). The INC was a dissident group headed by Ahmed Chalabi who was a fierce opponent of Saddam Hussein's regime, was favoured by Iran and was determined to be the post-war leader of Iraq. His intelligence was largely unverifiable political stories and intrigues, supposedly from inside sources in Iraq.\n\nOften overlooked is the highly cooperative attitude of the Iraqis during the inspections in 2002-2003. They saw clearly that they were being blamed for the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that there was likely to be a war and saw full cooperation as a last chance to prevent it. They negotiated reasonable terms for inspections by UNMOVIC and the IAEA in 2002 and 2003 and provided full access to people, places and information linked to nuclear activities.\n\nAn example of this cooperation concerned one of the highest-profile pieces of misinformation to emerge from Washington in the run-up to war. Claims started circulating in around 2000 that Iraq was seeking to import semi-processed uranium ore, called yellowcake, from Niger, and that this was for developing nuclear weapons. In fact, Iraq already had sufficient uranium stockpiled for peaceful uses had it wished to divert some for a weapons programme. Nevertheless, the claim was leaked to the media and cited in public statements by senior government figures, including President Bush in his 2003 State of the Union address.\n\nThe source documents that the yellowcake story was based on were held back from the IAEA for several months, until someone in the US State Department passed them on unofficially in an attempt to undermine the CIA's claims. It took the IAEA Iraq team leader only hours to demonstrate that the documents were crude forgeries. Iraq gave the IAEA inspectors full access to interviewees and records to confirm the story.\n\nWe soon came to realize that none of the findings of our inspections were making it back to the most important audience in the United States: US policy makers. I discussed this with a contact I had at the US mission in Vienna. He advised me to give up because 'they don't want to hear what you have to say'. 'They' were presumably all the people in the chain between us and the ultimate decision makers in Washington. As the weeks of inspections went by, the people in this chain, from the bottom to the top, evidently learned what kind of news would be welcomed by their superiors and what would not.\n\nUS organizations like the CIA, the National Photographic Interpretation Center and the Department of Energy (DOE) that had supplied the UN inspectors with solid intelligence in 1991 were now muzzled. We were receiving far more information and engagement from other governments. When we passed back our findings to US government sources through the UN, they were generally ignored.\n\nThe UNMOVIC and IAEA inspectors were derided by the CIA and others as international flunkies unable to understand what Washington knew. In his State of the Union address, President Bush claimed that the Iraqi scientists we were interviewing were intelligence officers who had been coached in what to say -- despite the fact that we knew some of their bona fides from inspections in the 1990s. On the day we were told to pack up and leave Baghdad, as the bombing was about to start, I was preparing for a meeting with Jaffar Dhia Jaffar, the head of the Iraqi nuclear programme dismantled in 1991.\n\nAnalysts in the CIA and the 'intelligence cell' at the Pentagon no longer interacted with the inspectors and their findings. This was all the more remarkable that the UN inspectors were ignored given that a very large fraction of the new inspectors in 2002 came from the US military and the national nuclear weapons laboratories of the DOE. Most had been involved in earlier inspections. They had a broad grasp of the issues raised and solved in previous years. They had access to classified US intelligence and had many days' experience in the field, first in the early 1990s, and then in 2002 and early 2003.\n\nThe CIA and Pentagon analysts also disregarded information from other branches of government, such as opinions on nuclear issues from experts in the DOE. Instead they were making faulty judgements based on data that was often decades old, trying to solve problems that had been resolved in the early 1990s, along with claims from unreliable defectors. Anything that did not align with their conclusions was ignored. Politics, compliance and groupthink prevailed. It is sobering to think that one junior CIA analyst prevailed in the falsehood that aluminium tubes were for a nuclear weapons programme. His credentials to make the claims were virtually non-existent, yet he convinced colleagues and superiors that his interpretation was right and the DOE nuclear experts were wrong.\n\nThe claim by David Kay -- 'we were almost all wrong' -- reflects how most people still think of the events of 2002-2003: as a story of faulty and inadequate intelligence, rather than robust and reliable intelligence information ignored.\n\nThe weapons inspectors had credibility that dwarfed that of Curveball and other defectors, who clearly had much to gain by fabricating intelligence about the Iraqi regime, as well as that of desk-bound analysts poring over out-of-date information and satellite photos.\n\nThe result of all this was a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people and fueled years of instability in Iraq and around the region. The CIA spent a billion dollars looking for Iraq's non-existent WMD programmes in 2003-2004 only to find that UNMOVIC and the IAEA had got it almost perfectly right. A succession of later inquiries and commissions into the intelligence failings in Washington and London rarely asked why the UN weapons inspectors were ignored. So far the lesson seems to have been lost on the policy community. This should not happen again.",

                    "body": "When America ignores Kurdish corruption, China and Russia benefit\n\nWithin the State Department, many diplomats scoffed at President George W. Bush's democracy agenda. Frank Ricciardone, Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Egypt, mocked it when, in 2005, he told young Egyptians that dictator Hosni Mubarak was so popular he could even win elections in the United States.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton meanwhile sought a reset with Russia, while her aide Jake Sullivan embraced the fiction that Iran was democratic and that flooding so-called reformers with cash could bring the regime in from the cold. In Iraqi Kurdistan, the hostility to democracy meant doubling down on the dictatorship of the Barzanis and turning a blind eye to the corruption in which they engaged.\n\nDiplomats rationalized their embrace of dictatorship in various ways. Realistically, the Barzanis controlled things; they were impossible to avoid. Democracies are messy, and many diplomats believe dictators can deliver. It can be nice to have a one-stop shop. Dictators might also guarantee security. Unstated is they might instigate violence if diplomats talk to their competitors. Many diplomats also condescend that Arabs, Russians, Turks, or Kurds are not culturally capable of democracy. Realists might simply say that the State Department should not let a local desire for freedom and liberty abroad interfere with core US.. interests.\n\nIraqi Kurdistan, however, increasingly shows why ignoring dictatorship and corruption undermines long-term interests.\n\nTwenty years ago, George W. Bush ordered US forces into Iraq to ouster Saddam Hussein. The notion that oil motivated the war was nonsense. Fear of Iraq's weapons programs and terror sponsorship was real. Saddam had already started two major wars. The status quo was not tenable. Sanctions were collapsing, and evidence conclusively shows Saddam planned to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction as soon as freed from the yoke of sanctions.\n\nUpon Iraq's liberation, oil companies moved in. Washington encouraged American companies to invest in Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan for two reasons: First, oil generated revenue for Iraq to rebuild. Second, American companies denied space to Russian and Chinese rivals.\n\nCorruption, however, took a toll. Even more so than in Iraq, oil companies found that the political climate and corruption did not offset potential profits.\n\nThe Barzanis and their Kurdish partners systematically cheated on contracts in the belief that the lack of an independent judiciary would protect them from consequences. Outside arbitration is routinely found against Iraqi Kurdistan to the tune of billions of dollars. Exxon Mobil quit. Kurdish politicians say that Houston-based HKN is not far behind.\n\nAmerican oil field services companies like Baker Hughes are also abandoning the region. In several cases, the Iraqi Supreme Court decision against Kurdistan's oil law is merely cover for a preordained decision. In the place of American companies, Russia's Rosneft and China's Addax Petroleum and Gezhouba Group have moved in. The Moscow and Beijing-based companies are not constrained by the foreign corrupt practices act, as theIR American counterparts are.\n\nNone of this was preordained, but the U.S. will not pay the price in regional influence for its two decades of ignoring corruption and poor governance. Every U.S. ambassador in Baghdad and consul-general in Erbil saw Iraqi Kurdistan only through the lens of short-term gains; they all ignored the long-term consequence of their actions.\n\nIn effect, they gifted not only billions of dollars but also geopolitical positioning to America's rivals. That they did so upon the hopes of democracy and liberty only compounds the tragedy. There are no shortcuts nor such a thing as cost-free corruption in international affairs.\n\nMichael Rubin is a former Pentagon official whose major research areas are the Middle East, Turkey, Iran and diplomacy.

                    "body": "James Phillips is a Visiting Fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nTomorrow President Bush meets Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki for a two-day summit to discuss security in Iraq and other issues. Both Bush and Maliki are under pressure to craft a joint policy that will restore momentum to efforts to build a stable and democratic Iraq. President Bush should use the summit to start work on a comprehensive plan to dampen Iraq's growing sectarian tensions, expand the capacity of Iraq's fledgling government to defend Iraqis from anti-democratic insurgents and militias, establish the rule of law, and gradually transfer security responsibilities from coalition allies to the Iraqi government. This will require long and extensive negotiations with the Iraqi government, but it is important that this process start with a clear understanding of what is required of both governments.\n\nA Strong Message for Maliki\n\nBush's message should be that the United States will play an important supporting role but that Iraqis must take the lead to contain and ease sectarian strife, to build a broad-based ruling coalition that can undercut Sunni Arab support for the insurgents, and to marginalize, demobilize, and disarm the various sectarian militias that threaten stability and the rule of law.\n\nBush must be clear that the United States can help build state institutions, but only the Iraqis can build a nation. If Iraqis are unable to strike a power-sharing formula that addresses security, political influence, and an equitable share of oil revenues, the situation will deteriorate regardless of U.S. actions. The United States cannot save Iraqis from themselves. If the slide towards a full-blown civil war continues, the American people will become increasingly unwilling to continue their sacrifices of blood and treasure that have made possible the gestation of a fragile democratic government in Iraq.\n\nMaliki's highest priority must be to hammer out a stable power-sharing agreement with other Iraqi leaders to rein in the power of militias, drain away support for the Sunni Arab-dominated insurgency, and reduce the intensity of civil violence to manageable proportions. Realistically, insurgent attacks will plague Iraq for years to come. But it is important to reduce the scale of the violence to halt the slide towards a full-blown Sunni-Shia civil war.\n\nThe mushrooming of such a sectarian conflict would undermine the rationale for maintaining U.S. military forces in Iraq. While the defeat of the various insurgent groups is an achievable goal if the Iraqi government can co-opt Sunni Arab moderates and drive wedges between Islamic radical insurgents and less militant groups, a raging civil war offers little hope of a plausible victory. Bush should tell Maliki that the United States is willing to fight for a stable outcome, but a sectarian solution that unduly favors Mailiki's Shiite supporters will risk continuing U.S. support.\n\nU.S. Strategic Goals\n\nThe United States did not intervene in Iraq to remedy historic Shiite grievances against Saddam's Sunni-dominated regime or to build democracy (although this became a supplementary goal after the war). President Bush should return to the basics and remind Prime Minister Maliki that the U.S.'s primary goal was to neutralize the threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and to keep such weapons out of the hands of terrorists. Although no recently produced WMD caches were found, Iraq's prohibited WMD programs were dismantled and no longer pose a threat to the world.\n\nWinning the global war against terrorism must remain the highest U.S. priority. Washington must prevent Iraq from becoming a base of operations for al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups that target Americans. Washington has a vital interest in building an Iraq that is an ally in the war on terrorism, not an adversary. The United States must also prevent Iraq from falling under the influence of Iran and Syria, two of the world's most dangerous state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nThe Bush Administration had hoped that democratic elections would boost stability in Iraq, but they have not yet had a calming effect, in part because many of the sectarian political parties have exacerbated tensions. A stable, democratic Iraq remains a worthy long-term U.S. goal, but this project now rests primarily in Iraqi hands. If the Iraqi government can inch toward political stability while containing the insurgency and denying terrorist groups a base for international operations, that would be a net victory for the United States, even if Iraq remains a far-from-perfect democracy.\n\nFour Key Recommendations for President Bush\n\nWhen President Bush meets Prime Minister Maliki in Jordan tomorrow, he should act on four objectives:\n\nConclusion\n\nThe situation in Iraq could worsen quickly if the United States succumbs to wishful thinking about the consequences of a rapid withdrawal. Adopting such a negligent policy could result in a failed state that would be much more dangerous than Afghanistan as a base for al-Qaeda and other terrorists. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq lies in close proximity to the heart of the Arab world and the center of gravity of world oil production. Iraq has become a central front in the global war against terrorism.\n\nPrime Minister Maliki's elected government, only six months old, needs time to build up Iraq's security forces, impose the rule of law, and deliver better services to the Iraqi people. The United States must remain actively engaged to give the Iraqi government a fighting chance to defeat the insurgency and avert a full-scale civil war. Maliki's government must take the lead in disarming and demobilizing militias, with the U.S. in a supporting role. Maliki needs to know that if Iraqis fail to break the power of the militias and halt the momentum toward a civil bloodbath, the United States cannot save Iraqis from themselves.\n\nJames Phillips is Research Fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs in the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, a division of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for International Studies, at The Heritage Foundation.",

                    "body": "Nile Gardiner is director of The Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom and Bernard and Barbara Lomas Fellow.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair gives evidence this week to the Iraq Study Group[1]amid mounting calls for a withdrawal of British forces and sagging public support for the war. An early withdrawal of British forces would boost al-Qaeda, risk civil war in Iraq, and severely strain the Anglo-U.S. relationship, to the detriment of the war on terrorism and global security. While the Prime Minister is right to reject calls for a British withdrawal from Iraq, his decision to increase ties with Iran and Syria is a serious strategic error that would do no more than embolden these rogue regimes.\n\nBritish support for a withdrawal from Iraq is mounting. In the latest Guardian/ICM poll, 61 percent of British voters supported the exit of British troops from Iraq by the end of the year, with 45 percent backing an immediate withdrawal. Just 30 percent of those surveyed favored maintaining a British military presence in Iraq beyond 2006.[2]In a YouGov poll for The Daily Telegraph, a staggering 77 percent of Britons surveyed expressed \"not much confidence\" or \"no confidence at all\" in the British government's handling of the war in Iraq.[3]\n\nIn addition to public disillusionment, Downing Street faces rising political opposition to the Prime Minister's Iraq policy and increasingly vocal dissent from within Britain's overstretched armed forces. The government narrowly prevailed in a recent vote in the House of Commons calling for an inquiry into Britain's handling of the Iraq war that was proposed by the anti-war Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties and backed by the Conservative Party. And Sir Richard Dannatt, the new Chief of the General Staff of the British Army, sent shockwaves through the British political establishment in October, with a controversial and remarkably frank interview in which he stated that the presence of British troops was \"exacerbating the security problems\" in Iraq. Dannatt linked the Iraq war to \"Islamist violence\" in Britain, criticized pre-war planning, and expressed his hope that British troops would leave Iraq \"soon.\"[4]\n\nThe Prime Minister is right to reject pressure for an immediate withdrawal. In a major speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in the City of London on November 13, he presented a powerful defense of the British commitment to the Iraqi people.[5]Blair also challenged the fashionable and increasingly pervasive anti-Americanism in Britain, describing it as \"the surest route to the destruction of our national interest\" and reminding his audience of the need \"to keep our partnership with America strong.\"[6]\n\nAn early withdrawal of the 7,200 British forces from Iraq would be a huge mistake. A British pullout would shatter the international coalition, greatly weaken America's position in the center and north of the country, strengthen the insurgency, embolden al-Qaeda, and allow Iran-backed militia groups to increase their influence in the Shia-dominated south. In addition to threatening Iraq's future, a pullout would also damage the Anglo-U.S. alliance that has led the war on terrorism.\n\nA British pullout from Iraq would lead to specific consequences:\n\nWhile the Prime Minister staunchly defended the principle of standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States in Iraq, he also sought to create some distance with the White House in his approach toward rogue states such as Iran and Syria. The Prime Minister's Iran gambit is aimed at influencing the thinking of the Baker-Hamilton Commission on Iraq and at placating domestic critics who claim that he slavishly follows Washington's agenda, rather than influences it.\n\nIn his Lord Mayor's address, Blair advocated a possible \"new partnership\" with the Iranians:\n\nOffer Iran a clear strategic choice: they help the Middle East Peace Process not hinder it; they stop supporting terrorism in Lebanon or Iraq; and they abide by, not flout, their international obligations. In that case, a new partnership is possible. Or alternatively, they face the consequences of not doing so: isolation.[7]\n\nThis call for U.S. and British engagement with Tehran to find a solution to the violence in Iraq is na\u00efve and risky, and the Bush Administration should reject it.\n\nIran remains the world's biggest state sponsor of international terrorism and the greatest threat to world peace, alongside North Korea. The Iranian regime is reportedly building close ties with al-Qaeda's leadership and training senior al-Qaeda operatives in Tehran in an effort to build a strategic terror alliance against the West.[8]\n\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is pressing forward with plans for a nuclear weapons program and continues to maintain that Israel should be \"wiped off the map.\" Iran is also a huge part of the problem in Iraq, with Iranian-backed Shia militias actively engaged in a war against British forces in the south of the country. Blair's strategy of reaching out to Iran follows the European Union's fruitless policy of \"constructive engagement\" with Iran over its nuclear ambitions and is similarly likely to embolden rather than weaken Iran as a destructive force on the world stage.\n\nBlair's call for a new approach to Tehran mirrors the British government's growing engagement with Syria, another world leader in facilitating terrorism. In late October, Blair sent his most senior foreign policy adviser, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, to Damascus in a \"secret diplomatic initiative\" to meet with President Bashar al-Assad and discuss Iraq, Lebanon, and Israel.[9]The visit was London's highest-level contact with Syria since the Iraq war and was a highly controversial move, coming at a time when Syria is expanding its ties with Tehran, increasing its political and military support for Hamas and Hezbollah, and providing assistance to Sunni insurgent groups inside Iraq. The rapprochement with Damascus also took place against the background of the ongoing United Nations investigation into Syria's role in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.[10]\n\nThe British government's decision to engage with Iran and Syria is a serious strategic error in judgment that is likely to exacerbate the situation in Iraq rather than improve it. It risks dividing the Anglo-American alliance and strengthening the hands of rogue regimes that have a vested interest in weakening the partnership between Washington and London on the world stage.\n\nThe U.S. and Britain must remain united in their determination to win the war in Iraq, despite inevitable disagreements over strategy. An early withdrawal of British or American troops would have catastrophic implications for the future of Iraq and be seen by many Iraqis as a betrayal of trust. By liberating Iraq and removing one the most brutal regimes of modern times, Britain and the United States made a powerful commitment to the future of the Iraqi people that must be honored. There should be no major pullout of Allied forces from the country until key military objectives have been met and Iraq is stable and secure.\n\nThe U.S. and the UK share a fundamental national interest in staying in Iraq and defeating the insurgency. The Middle East would view an early withdrawal as a humiliating defeat for the West and an emphatic victory for those who represent al-Qaeda in Iraq. A pullout would be an unparalleled propaganda success for a barbaric terror organization that has murdered thousands of Iraqi men, women, and children.\n\nIraq today is the central battleground in the global war against terrorism and, together with Afghanistan, is the only place in the world where American and British troops can actively engage al-Qaeda and its allies in active combat. Iraq tests the West's resolve to confront and ultimately defeat the al-Qaeda threat, and this epic confrontation must be fought and won by U.S., British, and Iraqi forces.\n\nNile Gardiner, Ph.D., is the Bernard and Barbara Lomas Fellow in and Director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, a division of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for International Studies, at The Heritage Foundation.

                    "body": "Iraqi resistance and political groups have condemned US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's unannounced visit to Baghdad and Washington's intent to continue its military presence in the country under the pretext of preserving its stability, Iran's Press TV reported.\n\nThe Pentagon chief visited Baghdad on 7 March, just weeks ahead of the 20 anniversary of the illegal 2003 US invasion and occupation of Iraq. During the visit, Austin confirmed Washington's commitment to maintaining its military presence in the country.\n\nIraqi political groups and resistance factions criticized Secretary Austin's visit as an \"insult to the blood of martyrs\" and a \"brazen act,\" stressing that they will not wait for any permission to expel the US forces from their country.\n\nThey reaffirmed their pledge to end the American \"occupation\" and expel the forces.\n\nHassan Salem, an Iraqi MP close to the Asaeb Ahl al-Haq resistance group, stated that \"To the occupying US defense minister! I condemn your trip, and I do not welcome you because your hands are stained with the blood of Iraqi martyrs, especially the martyred commanders of victory, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Qassem Soleimani,\" Salem noted.\n\nAbu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Qassem Soleimani were killed in a US airstrike in January 2020 after playing key roles in the defeat of ISIS.\n\nAbu Ali al Askari, head of the security bureau of the Kataeb Hezbollah resistance group, announced that the visit of the \"American war minister\" Lloyd Austin to Iraq was \"an insult to the martyrs, the nation, and the history of this country.\"\n\nAl Askari stressed that Kataeb Hezbollah will not commit to any understanding between the political parties and the occupying forces and that the resistance group will \"not wait for anyone's permission to confront the occupation.\"\n\n\"Some political parties and their leaders should know that they should be careful in dealing with the enemy, whether in the clothing of a diplomat or in the clothing of a warrior and remember that they (politicians) claim to represent a nation that is against foreign domination,\" he remarked.\n\nThe Bush administration's illegal 2003 invasion triggered a resistance movement against the US military presence, which was taken over by elements of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi's al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) organization. This, combined with the US military's use of Shia-dominated security forces to suppress the Sunni-dominated insurgency, soon triggered a sectarian civil war.\n\nIn 2011, most US forces withdrew from Iraq, but US military officials released thousands of AQI militants from the US-run Bucca prison, including many of the organization's top leadership. US planners sought to revive the group to launch an insurgency against the government in neighboring Syria led by Bashar al Assad.\n\nEnjoying the direct support of US allies Saudi Arabia and Turkey, AQI militants, by this time referring to themselves as the Islamic State, turned their focus back to Iraq in 2014, conquering many of Iraq's major cities, including Mosul, Ramadi, and Falluja, while also carrying out a genocide against Iraq's Yazidi religious minority in Sinjar.",

However, IS remnants have since sneaked into urban centers, deserts and rugged areas, carrying out frequent guerilla attacks against security forces and civilians. \u25a0",

Subscribe here.\n\nWhen the United States invaded Iraq in March 2003, together with the United Kingdom and a handful of tag-along allies, it unmade not just a dictatorship but the nation itself.\n\nAs the invasion sprinted from victory over Iraq's President Saddam Hussein to rapid dismantling of government and then hapless occupation, groups in Iraq began to contest the idea of the nation. This has led to a long-running civil war, the imposition of a sectarian constitution, and ultimately the mass exodus of ethnic and religious minorities that were afforded only nominal protections and no real power under the new constitution.\n\nIn \"Nation-destroying, emigration and Iraqi nationhood after the 2003 intervention,\" Oula Kadhum examines how before the modern state of Iraq could congeal into its present form, the existing national community was actively destroyed, broken up, and remade, with minorities taking their communities to new and safer homes beyond the borders of Iraq.\n\n\"Caught between more dominant and competing ethnic and sectarian nationalisms, non-Muslim Iraqi minorities became targets in the quest for territorial gain and political power, or were otherized through takfir campaigns and imagined out of the nation,\" Kadhum writes.\n\n\"Takfir campaigns refer to the campaigns by ISIS to target non-Muslim and Muslim infidels,\" and while ISIS may have been the most explicitly exclusionary of the factions to context for power in post-invasion Iraq, the reordering of the nation around sectarian lines predates and post-dates its emergence and power.\n\nTo understand this nation-destroying, Kadhum conducted interviews with members of Iraqi diaspora communities. Today, those diaspora communities, in many cases, represent the largest share of a given group's population, as the war in Iraq left no protection and no civic nationalism for minorities to share in.\n\n\"Whereas before 2003, there were roughly 1.5 million Christians in Iraq, today that figure stands at just 250,000. More generally, minorities in Iraq were said to comprise 10% of the Iraqi population in 2003; these included Armenian, Syriac and Chaldo-Assyrian Christians, Baha'is, Jews, Sabaean-Mandaeans and Yazidis as well as ethnic minorities such as Shabaks, Turkmen and Palestinian refugees,\" Kadhum writes.\n\n\"By 2010, and even before the 2014 threat from ISIS, that number had dwindled to 3% for Iraq's most vulnerable minority groups, excluding Turkmen and Faili Kurds,\" she continues.\n\nAs of 2020, ethnic minorities made up no more than 5% of the population.\n\nThe US-driven effort to build a state in Iraq, especially amid the growing civil- and anti-occupation war, settled on a confessional system, formally taking signifiers like Sunni, Shi'a, or Kurd, and making them a fixed political identity.\n\n\"Iraqi minorities were no longer discriminated against linguistically or culturally, as they were under the Iraqi constitution, but their citizenship has been relegated from an active one to a passive one as their electoral power has effectively been curtailed,\" Kadhum writes.\n\n\"Indeed, apportioned just nine out of 329 parliamentary seats in the parliamentary electoral laws, the ability of Iraqi minorities to participate with any significance in Iraq's democratic governance has been negligible if not non-existent.\"\n\nUltimately, Kadhum concludes, \"The 2003 intervention, therefore, catalysed a process of dividing the Iraqi nation into primordial entities rather than unifying it under a civic nationalism.\"",

Austin III visited Iraq yesterday for meetings with leaders in Baghdad and Erbil as part of a multiday trip through the Middle East to reaffirm U.S. commitments in the region.\n\nThe trip includes stops in Jordan, Israel, Egypt and Iraq.\n\nIn the morning, Austin met in Baghdad with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Iraqi Defense Minister Thabit Al-Abbasi.\n\nThere, Austin reaffirmed the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership and underscored the U.S. commitment to a secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq. The secretary also affirmed U.S. and coalition commitment to advising, assisting and enabling the Iraqi Security Forces at the invitation of the government of Iraq to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS -- also called Daesh.\n\n\"We're deeply committed to ensuring that the Iraqi people can live in peace and dignity, with safety and security and with economic opportunity for all,\" Austin said following the meeting. \"Our defense cooperation against Daesh is a key pillar of our bilateral relationship, and the United States remains committed to this fight in support of Iraq's security and the security of the entire region.\"\n\nJust a few years ago, Austin said, the group's members were spread across Iraq threatening both Iraqis and the stability of the entire region. The U.S., he said, convened a global coalition of 80 countries to defeat Daesh.\n\n\"That coalition responded to the request of the sovereign government of Iraq to work alongside them to defeat this ruthless terrorist enemy,\" Austin said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III speaks to traveling press in Baghdad following a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, March 7, 2023. The secretary's unannounced visit to Iraq also included a stop in Irbil to meet with the leaders of the Kurdistan Region.\n\nAs part of that coalition, Austin said more than 50,000 square kilometers of Iraq have been liberated from Daesh and more than 4.5 million Iraqis are no longer in fear of Daesh influence.\n\n\"We will continue to listen to our partners and rally together with them in this fight,\" Austin said. \"We will continue to harness the professionalism of the coalition's diplomats and assistance experts and warfighters, as well as the incredible professionals in the NATOmission here. We will continue to increase interoperability among our among our allies and partners and will continue working to accomplish this mission together.\n\nAustin said U.S. forces are ready to continue their work in Iraq with the continued agreement of the Iraqi government.\n\n\"These forces are operating in a noncombat, advise, assist and enable role to support the Iraqi-led fight against terrorism,\" he said. \"This is a critical mission, and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners.\"\n\nIn addition to discussion of on-going operations, Austin said he also discussed with the Iraqi prime minister the importance of future partnerships -- not just between the U.S. and Iraq, but between Iraq and its partners in the region.\n\n\"We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity,\" Austin said. \"And it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region. And so, I look forward to continuing to consult with our valued Iraqi partners and to advance our shared interests and to improve the lives of the Iraqi people.\"\n\nLater in the day, Austin flew north to meet with the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, Nechirvan Barzani. During that visit, Austin thanked the president for peshmerga, a Kurdish term for a fighting group, contributions to efforts to defeat Daesh.\n\nThe two men also discussed, among other things, threats to the stability of the Iraqi Kurdistan region and the efforts underway to unify and professionalize its forces in partnership with the United States.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Austin publicly acknowledged peshmerga contributions to the defeat-ISIS mission.\n\n\"Working together, the United States and Iraq, including the Iraqi Kurdistan region, have taken great strides to restore Iraqi sovereignty,\" Austin said. \"Let me applaud the invaluable contributions to this fight made by the Kurdish peshmerga as part of Iraq's security forces.\"\n\nAustin again underscored the U.S. commitment to the defeat-ISIS mission, and to Iraq.\n\n\"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq to support the Iraqi-led fight against Daesh,\" he said. \"We're glad to be able to support your forces and defend the Iraqi people.\"\n\nAustin also condemned cross-border attacks by Iran, acknowledge the threat they pose to Iraqi sovereignty, and called for more cooperation between Erbil and Baghdad.\n\n\"For the country of Iraq to realize its full potential, Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis, and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdistan region,\" Austin said.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Austin also visited with U.S. service members, as well as coalition partners, who are stationed in Erbil as part of the advise and assist mission there.",

                    "body": "The trip includes stops in Jordan, Israel, Egypt and Iraq.\n\nIn the morning, Austin met in Baghdad with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Iraqi Defense Minister Thabit Al-Abbasi.\n\nThere, Austin reaffirmed the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership and underscored the U.S. commitment to a secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq. The secretary also affirmed U.S. and coalition commitment to advising, assisting and enabling the Iraqi Security Forces at the invitation of the government of Iraq to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS -- also called Daesh.\n\n\"We're deeply committed to ensuring that the Iraqi people can live in peace and dignity, with safety and security and with economic opportunity for all,\" Austin said following the meeting. \"Our defense cooperation against Daesh is a key pillar of our bilateral relationship, and the United States remains committed to this fight in support of Iraq's security and the security of the entire region.\"\n\nJust a few years ago, Austin said, the group's members were spread across Iraq threatening both Iraqis and the stability of the entire region. The U.S., he said, convened a global coalition of 80 countries to defeat Daesh.\n\n\"That coalition responded to the request of the sovereign government of Iraq to work alongside them to defeat this ruthless terrorist enemy,\" Austin said.\n\nAs part of that coalition, Austin said more than 50,000 square kilometers of Iraq have been liberated from Daesh and more than 4.5 million Iraqis are no longer in fear of Daesh influence.\n\n\"We will continue to listen to our partners and rally together with them in this fight,\" Austin said. \"We will continue to harness the professionalism of the coalition's diplomats and assistance experts and warfighters, as well as the incredible professionals in the NATO mission here. We will continue to increase interoperability among our among our allies and partners and will continue working to accomplish this mission together.\n\nAustin said U.S. forces are ready to continue their work in Iraq with the continued agreement of the Iraqi government.\n\n\"These forces are operating in a noncombat, advise, assist and enable role to support the Iraqi-led fight against terrorism,\" he said. \"This is a critical mission, and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners.\"\n\nIn addition to discussion of on-going operations, Austin said he also discussed with the Iraqi prime minister the importance of future partnerships -- not just between the U.S. and Iraq, but between Iraq and its partners in the region.\n\n\"We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity,\" Austin said. \"And it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region. And so, I look forward to continuing to consult with our valued Iraqi partners and to advance our shared interests and to improve the lives of the Iraqi people.\"\n\nLater in the day, Austin flew north to meet with the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, Nechirvan Barzani. During that visit, Austin thanked the president for peshmerga, a Kurdish term for a fighting group, contributions to efforts to defeat Daesh.\n\nThe two men also discussed, among other things, threats to the stability of the Iraqi Kurdistan region and the efforts underway to unify and professionalize its forces in partnership with the United States.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Austin publicly acknowledged peshmerga contributions to the defeat-ISIS mission.\n\n\"Working together, the United States and Iraq, including the Iraqi Kurdistan region, have taken great strides to restore Iraqi sovereignty,\" Austin said. \"Let me applaud the invaluable contributions to this fight made by the Kurdish peshmerga as part of Iraq's security forces.\"\n\nAustin again underscored the U.S. commitment to the defeat-ISIS mission, and to Iraq.\n\n\"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq to support the Iraqi-led fight against Daesh,\" he said. \"We're glad to be able to support your forces and defend the Iraqi people.\"\n\nAustin also condemned cross-border attacks by Iran, acknowledge the threat they pose to Iraqi sovereignty, and called for more cooperation between Erbil and Baghdad.\n\n\"For the country of Iraq to realize its full potential, Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis, and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdistan region,\" Austin said.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Austin also visited with U.S. service members, as well as coalition partners, who are stationed in Erbil as part of the advise and assist mission there.",

                    "body": "James Phillips is a Visiting Fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at The Heritage Foundation.\n\n789 September 5,1990 INTRODUCIION George Bush boldly committed more than 100,000 American troops hundreds of warplanes, and more than 60 warships to defend United States another Western interests threatened by Iraqi dictator Saddam Husseins August 2 invasion of Kuwait. This rapid military buildup, the largest mobilization of American military might since theVietnam War, already has achieved its primary and most important objective: deterring an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia, the worlds largest oil exporter.\n\nYet, while there is little doubt that the US. would use military force to protect the Saudi oil fields, on which many Western industrial democracies in creasingly depend, it is unclear that the Bush Administration is willing or able to use its military mu s cle to achieve its other stated objectives in the Iraq crisis: an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of the legitimate govern ment of Kuwait, and the Iraqi release of thousands of American and other hostages. Barring an Iraqi provocation, such as m i streatment of the hostages or military attack or sponsorship of terrorism, Washington is even less likely to use military force in pursuit of two other goals hinted by American offi cials: the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the destruction of Iraqs weapo ns of mass destruction. Even if Bush should decide to lance the Iraqi boil with a militaxy attack, it will take the U.S. six to eight weeks to amass enough forces on the ground in Saudi Arabia to blunt an Iraqi counterattack on the Saudi oil fields.\n\nKey Qu estions. As the military situation stabilizes, attention is likely to shift to the diplomatic and economic pressures that America and other countries are bringing to bear on Iraq. Foremost among these pressures are r the economic sanctions prohiiiting tra d e or financial that were imposed on August 6 by the United Nations Security Council in a 13-0 vote (with Yemen and Cuba abstainiug).The key questions thus are: Will the embargo inflict unbearable pain on the Iraqi economy? If so, how long will it take And , finally, will the embargo force Saddam to retreat from Kuwait will strangle the Iraqi economy. Iraq's oil exports and food, arms and in dustrial imports can be choked off by the multinational forces surrounding Iraq ons with Iraq The answer to the first question is: yes.The U.N.-backed embargo probably The answer to the second question is more problematic: It may take as long as a year before the embargo achieves its full economic impact, and this could be delayed further by extensive cheating.\n\nThe answer to the third question is that the embargo probably will not mm pel Saddam Hussein to back down and relinquish Kuwait and his hostages.\n\nUltimately, to succeed an embargo must break its target's willpower. This is more a matter of psychology than of economics. Saddam is unlikely to accept a humiliating defeat which will threaten his persod power and perhaps sur vival.\n\nSaddam's Hostages. While an embargo eventually will generate powerful pressure on Saddam to compromise, it alone probably will not be enough to compl him to give up Kuwait on terms minimdly acceptable to Washingon total and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and freedom for all hostages. In addition to the 13,000 Westerners and 2 million Kuwaitis es timated to be held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait, Saddam essentially has taken the Iraqi people hostage. He is unlikely to yield to international economic pressures, given the high costs of defeat.\n\nWhat this means for Washington is that the U.S. must continue to build up its militaq forces aro und Iraq. Saddam understands force. Ultimately, it will not be the embargo, but only the threat of force or its actual use that will force Saddam to give up the booty of his aggression and pull out of Kuwait ECONOMIC SANCIIONSTHE HISTORICAL RECORD Economi c sanctions have a poor historical record of success in compelling determined states to accede to the demands of the embargoing powers.The Central Powers of World War I, the Axis powers of World War XI, North Korea during the Korean War, and North,Vietnam during tbe various In dochinese Wars, all continued their aggression despite economic sanctions and blockades. Khomeini's Iran shrugged off Western economic sanctions while holding 52 American hostages for 444 days in 1979 to 19\n\n81. According 2 to former I ranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, Iran released its hostages in January 1981 primarily out of fey that the new American President Ronald Reagan, would attack Iran The West has a poor track record in sustaining concerted international economic sanctio n s. It did not do so against Cuba, Itan, hi Syria, or the Soviet Union. Most embargoes fail because they are not air-tight. Some states refuse to participate or violate the embargo that they have pledged to uphold. Even when a broad coalition of states dec lares an embargo, private entrepreneurs seeking black market profits inevitably relax the embargos pinch. The 1967 UN.-sponsored embargo.of Rhodesia, for example, was un dercut for years by sanctions busters.\n\nOne of the rare examples of a successfd economic sanctions, ironically was the Western oil boycott imposed against Iraqs neighbor and bitter rival Iran, from 1951 to 19\n\n53. After Iran nationalized the oil interests of a British oil company in March 1951, Westem companies refused to purchase Iranian oi l, choosing instead to increase their purchases born Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.The ensuing economic collapse of Iran led to popular disaffection with the anti-Western Iranian leader, Mohammed Mossadegh. After growing domestic turmoil, elements of the Iranian army staged a CIA-supported militaq coup that toppled Mossadegh in August 1953 IRAQS VULNERABILITYTO ECONOMIC SANCTIONS Like Mossadeghs Iran, Saddams Iraq is overwhelmingly dependent on oil exports to fuel its economy, and therefore would be hit h a rd by a successful oil boycott. More than 90 percent of Iraqs export revenues and roughly half of its ~ti~nal income have been derived from oil exports of roughly 2.7 mil lion barrels per day. Oil is a bulky commodity transported primarily through easily m onitored pipelines and oil tankers. Approximately 90 percent of Iraqs oil exports flowed through pipelines throughTurkey to the Mediter ranean Sea and through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea Both pipelines were shut in compliance with the August 6 U.N. securi ty Council resolution prohibiting trade with Iraq.This forces Iraq to rely on the small quantities of oil that it can truck into Jordan or ship out through wardamaged oil ter minatn on its narrow Persian Gulf coastline.\n\nBleak Financial Future. American and Western naval forces, authorized by an August 25 US. Security Council resolution to enforce the economic embargo against Iraq, can easily interdict Iraqs remaining oil exports, which have been routed primarily toYemen. Deprived of oil revenues, the Iraqi economy gradually will grind to a halt. Iraq already has lost an estimated $1.5 1 See: Bani-Sa& iatervim, US Rdw, Winter 198l-l%2, p. 9 3 rbillion dollars in oil revenues since the onset of the crisis? Iraq now faces a bleak financial future. Although it h as gold and currency reserves worth about 65 billion, and may have looted $1 billion in gold and $2 billion in hard currency fro? Kuwaits Central Bank, Iraqs $4 billion in foreign assets have been frozen. It will be forced, moreover, to default on its hug e foreign debt, estimated at up to 80 billion; this, of course, discourages new loans even if Baghdad could find lenderswilling to violate the U.N. ban on finan cial transactions Offsetting Oil Losses. As during the 1951-1953 Iranian oil boycott, there are several sourcesof excess world oil production capacity that can be tapped to offset the loss to the world of roughly4 million barrels per day in Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil exports. Saudi Arabia announced on August 18 that it is ready to boost its oil productio n by 2 million barrels per day above its current produc tion of 5.38 million barrels per day. Venezuela is expected to raise production by 500,000 barrels per day, the United Arab Emirates can chip in another 5OO,OOO, Mexico and Nigeria may be able to cont ribute smaller amounts. All told, over 80 percent of the 4 million tarres per day shortfall in oil exports could be offset by other oil exporters.\n\nThe staying power of the embargo on Iraq also will be strengthened by the fact that the world was awash with oil supplies at the time of Iraqs invasion of Kuwait b cause OPEC was producing 2.7 million barrels per day over world demand. World stockpiles of oz were estimated to be 150 million to 200 mil lion barrels over normal levels. The industrial world, seared by past oil crises, had stockpiled just Over 1 billion barrels of emergency oil supplies (the equivalent of roughly 250 days of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil orts including 590 million barrels in the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Resewe?Another 100 mil lion barrels of oil was estimated to be aboard oil tankers en route to oil-im porting countries. The relatively favorable world oil situation will muffle the embego-related oil price explosion and reduce the incentives that oil-import ing states would have to try to circ umvent the embargo.\n\nCutting Iraqs Imports Iraqs industry, military production, and food im ports are extremely vulnerable to a well-organkd embargo. Iraqi industry relies on imported machinery, spare parts and raw materials. If deprived of these foreign go ods, Iraqi factories will slow to a halt. Shortages soon will ap pear in essential areas as spare parts become scarce for electric power sta tions, water treatment plants, and telephone equipment f 2 Financial Ernes, August 28,1990, p. 2 3 The Economist, August 18,1990, p. 34 4 Financial Ernes, August 21 1990, p. 1 5 EstixnateofOPECcconamistscitcdin77uEconomrst August 4,1990, p. 51 6 NewYorkTi, August 3,1990, p. A9.\n\nI ~incmeiol ri ugust a, 1990 4 Iraq developed its arms industry during its 198\n\n1988 war with Iran and now produces many of its own infantry weapons, small artillery pieces, and tanks, including modem Sovietdesigned T-72 battle tanks. But it lacks the capacity to build warplanes and may be vulnerable to spare parts shortages Dependen t on Food Imports. Two decades of centralized economic plan ning by Iraqs socialist Baathist Party and the destruction of agriculture in Iraqs rebellious Kurdish tribal areas have left Iraq dependent on food im ports to fulfill roughly three-fourths of the countxys nutritional needs. Iraq spends up to $3 billion per year on food imports, mounting to about one fourth of total imports. Iraq must import 70 perce$ of food supplies in bad harvest years and 60 percent in good harvest years. Dates are Iraqs only c rop with an exportable surplus.\n\nBread makes up roughly one third of the Iraqi diet, which is one of the best in the Middle East, with an average daily intake of 3,000 calories. Iraqis consume roughly 3.5 million tons of wheat per year, but this years Iraq wheat harvest, large by Iraqi standards, is\n\nmated at only 400,000 tons. A poor grain har vest last year forced Iraq to dip into its grain reserves last year.\n\nThe reserves were not replaced by imports because Baghdad was trying to reduce its foreign curr en cy expend.itures.l ne low level Imports as a Share of Total Iraqi Food Consumption Tea and Come 100 Sugar QQ Vegetable oll 99 Corn 00 Rice 04 Wheat 76 Meat 65 sollm: U.N. Food .nd -tun OrgubUon if dthg grain reserves and Saddams failure to anticipate i nternational reaction to his invasion of Kuwait by stockpiling food supplies beforehand have left Iraq vulnerable to a cutoff of food imports.\n\nIraq this year was projected to import 3 million tons of wheat and flour 600,OO tons of rice, 650,000 tons of mdu , 300,000 tons of corn and 300,000 tons of palm oil, among other items. Although it is not known how much of this was imported before the embargo, it is safe to conclude that Iraq will have a difficult time managing such a huge shortfall in its food requi rements.\n\nBread Lines in Baghdad. The embargo already has begun to hurt. Eggs sugar, cooking oil, fruits, and vegetables have disappeared from stores and 8 Financial Tunes August 21,1990, p. 2 10 Warhington Post, August 23 1990, p.

Prices have skyrocketed for meat, rice cooking oil, sugar, and other commodities. Saddam Hussein on August 12 called on Iraqis to tigh t en their belts and cut meat consumption by 50 per cent. Iraq's Revolutionaxy Council sternlywamed the next day that hoarders and black market profiteers would be executed Although the embargo has begun to pinch Iraqi food supplies, its full bite will not b e felt for four to six months. American officials estimate that Iraq has enough supplies ogts two staple foods, wheat and rice, for four months of normal consumption' Rationing could stretcb this another month and Iraqi bakeries could switch to barley whe n wheat flour runs short, tapping into an estimated seven month supply of barley, which is usually fed to livestock. Iraq has seized Kuwaiti food supply warehouses, estimated to contain enough canned pds to feed Kuwait's population of two million for four t o six months. But this will not go fkr for Iraq's much larger populationof seven teen million Iraq could stretch its mpplies further by expelling the up to 2 million expatriate workers in Iraq and Kuwait, Unidentified U.S. officials es timate that it will ta!j,cj,c four months to a year before Iraq is racked by widespread hunger.\n\nLittle Chance of Cheating. Iraq has little chance of significantly cheating on the embargo. Unlike previous food embargoes, such as the unilateral U.S grain embargo imposed on the Soviet Union following its invasion of Af ghanistan, the U.N. sanctions enjoy broad international support. Iraq's chief sources of food imports- America, Australia, Canada, and Western Europe are united in supporting the embargo. Neighboring governments in Iran Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Turkey have pledged to uphold the US. sanctions.\n\nBaghdad may hope that one or more of these governments allow cross-bor der smuggling but Iraq would have a difficult time paying for enough food or other supplies to improve appreciably its ability to hold out against the em bargo.\n\nAccording to US. officials, Cuba, Lii North Korea, Mauritania, Sudan and Yemsn have agreed secretly to ship goods and food to Iraq, primarily by aircraft. But this air bridge could not transport enough food to feed Iraq.\n\nMoreover, it could easily be severed by attacks by American warplanes, if Washington decides to shoot down aircraft that violate the embargo.\n\nCross-border smuggling; on the ground would be more difficult to halt, but Iraq will hav e difficulty financing extensive smuggling given its weak financial position and $80 billion foreign debt, At best, such smuggling only will postpone the suffocating economic impact of the embargo, not avert it entire- ly 6 Problems for Jordan. The bigges t hole in the embargo currently is Jordan.\n\nIt is economically dependent on Iraq, from which it gets 95 percent of its oil supplies and most of its foreign currency earnings. Jordans limping economy would be crippled if it imposed the U.N. sanctions on Iraq , its biggest foreign market. Jordans economic problems have encouraged the growth of Muslim fundamentalism and sparked riots in April 1989 among Jordans Bedouin population, the core of King Husseins popular support.The King also is wor ried that if he tu rns his back on Saddam Hussein, Jordans Palesthiam roughly 60 percent of the population, would rebel, incited by Iraqi agents and Saddams anti-Israel and pan-Arab rhetoric.\n\nJordan has equivocated on upholding the U.N. sanctions and has applied under a prov ision of the U.N. charter that permits states to appeal to the Security Council for relief if compliance with U.N. resolutions cause economic hardship.The Jordanian government estimates that imposing the sanctions will cost Jordan as much as $2 billion ov e r the next year, including 200 million in exports to Iraq, $200 don in transport fees for Iraqi trade over $300 million in remittances from the over l00,OOO Jgdanians in Kuwait and Iraq, and $295 million in debt repayments from Iraq. King Hussein also has sought aid from the West and oil from Saudi Arabia.\n\nUntil he is offered economic compensation to offset the economic and political costs of joining the embargo, King HusSein probably will continue to permit Jordan to remain Iraqs chief trade outlet. Approximately 500 trucks cross Jordans border W\n\nI Iraq each day, loaded with fruit, vegetables and construction materials. But Jordan alone cannot rescue Iraq from its economic plight. And Iraqs access to the outside wor ld through Jordan easily can be blocked by the multinational fleet enforcing the U.N. embargo by ex panding the blockade to include Jordans port of Aqaba THE EFFECTIVENESS OFTHE EMBARGO Although the embargo imwd on Iraqwill succeed in slowly suffocating t h e tradedependent Iraqi economy, it may not succeed in accomplishing the U.N.s political goals of forcing an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.he Iraqi government can funnel scarce food resources to the Iraqi army and already has announced its intention to do s o .

A9 7graphic pictures of the stamtion of Western hostages to undermine the resolve of embargoing states.The plight of Iraqs population also is sure to in flame Muslim fundamen t alists and Arab nationalists throughout the Middle East, undermining Arab governments that support the embargo U.N. Loopbola Given his past use of poison gas against Iraqi Kurds and his regimes widespread use of torture against Iraqi dissidents and their c hildfen Saddam is unlikely to flinch from continuing his occupation of Kuwait due to concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people. He essentially has taken his own people hostage, along with the estimated l3,OOO Westerners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. Sadda m is likely to defy the embargo indefinitely, knowing that his willingness to sacrifice the interests of his own people is greater than the U.N.s desire to starve innocent avilians. Saddam already knows that the U.N. fashioned a built-in constraint on its o wn embargo by exempting food and medical supplies from the embargo in humanitarian circumstance Saddam is motivated more by considerations about his own political sur vival than by the economic survival of his own people. He almost certainly will be adama n t in his refusal to withdraw from Kuwait on the U.N.s terms because such an unconditional withdrawal would be a humiliating defeat and an admission that his invasion was a gross miscalculatioIIThis would be par ticularly dangerous to Saddam in view of how little he has had to show for his ill-considered September 1980 invasion of Iran that mired Iraq in a bloody and costly eight-year war that imposed enormous hardship on his people. In fact, Saddam Wed Kuwait to help pay for the war with Iran and to broade n his narrow base of popular support by winning a trophy that would please Iraqi ~tionalists and answer the question of what Iraq had to show for its expensive military buildup Threatened Prestige. In a desperate attempt to forestall Iranian participa tion in the embargo against Iraq, Saddam on August 15 offered to meet al most all of Irans terms for a peace settlement, including Iraqi withdrawal from 700 square miles of Iranian territory and yielding to Iran control of part of the Shatt Al Arab estuary alo ng the border. If Saddams annexation of.\n\nKuwait should be reversed without lasting Iraqi benefits, then Saddam will be perceived to be the instigator and loser of two wars. Even Egypts Gamal Abdul Nassers prestige could not survive the loss of the 1967 Ara b-Israeli war. Saddams grip on Iraqs leadership thus would be weakened by such a foreign policy defeat. ominously, Saddam declared on -August 6, two-days after sanctions were imposed by the U.N that death is preferable to humiliation 19 Sec text of Unitcd Nations Scwity cwnCirRcdolutioa66l, August 6,l990, m AppendixI 8 UNDERMINING SADDAM'S POWER Although an embargo alone probably will not compel Saddam to disgorge Kuwait, it will weaken Iraq's military strength, sap Iraqi morale, and under mine Iraqi resol ve to support Saddam's unyielding policy of retaining Kuwait.\n\nThis eventually could weaken Saddam's grip on power and possibly pave the way for his ddd.The embargo drives home to all Iraqis the tremendous economic costs of Saddam's aggressive foreign polic y. It calls into question Saddam's judgment. Not only did Saddam underestimate the world's reaction to his adventure, but he failed to protect Iraq against that reaction by building up food reserves and by moving Iraq's $4 billion in foreign assets to pre vent them from being frozen.\n\nTo be sure, Saddam is feared by his own people and admired for his ruth lessness. But he does not enjoy wide public support. The core of his regime is made up of his family, relatives, and clan members from his home village of Tikrit, some 100 miles north of Baghdad.This \"TMti.mafia as it is known in Baghdad's political circles, has helped Saddam erect an efficient police state whose relentless repression has driven up to one million Iraqis into exile. Internal opposition has b een crushed, leading Iraqis to live by the Arab proverb Kiss the hand you cannot bite.\"\n\nUntested Endurance. Iraqis persevered through the eight-year war with Iran with minimal economic dislocation. Saddam could pursue a \"guns and butter\" policy because he was bankrolled by the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, including Kuwait. Hence Iraqis did not have to face economic privation.\n\nTheir staying power, therefore, has not yet been tested. Still, since Iraqis have been beaten down for so long, it is likely tha t while shortages of essential goods will produce grumbling and resentment, they probably will not lead to a Romania-type uprising against the dictatorship.\n\nThe Iraqi opposition is fragmented and weak. Because of the years of repression by Saddam's many s ecurity agencies, there is no effective opposi tion in Iraq. The opposition surviving leaders are in exile; even there they remain subject to assassination attempts by Iraqi secret agents.The opposi tion has no charismatic leader or unQing framework It is a loose collection of Kurds, Islamic fundamentalists ti~~dp, and leftists who are divided by ethnic, ideological, and religious cleavages.\n\nA greater potential threat to the regime iS posed by the army, which in creasingly has chafed under Saddam's brutal leadership. Aware of this dis satisfaction with him, Saddam incessantly shuffles military commanders and infiltrates the officer corps with numerous spies to prevent coups. Neverthe less, since the beginning of this year there have been four credible repo r ts of 20 Wrrsirigtm Patr, August 27,1990, p. Al3 9coup or asasination atppts, and in July Saddam went so far as to close down the officers clubs. An effective embargo against Iraq could give rest less Iraqi officers even greater incentives to overthrow sa d dam Bush has ordered planning for a covert program to oust Saddam, according to an August 6 leak in the Wkshiqgton Past. An American-sponsored coup would be difficult to mount successfully, given limited U.S. access to Iraqs clod Society. Unlike Iran in 1 9 53, the CIA probably has no cohesive opposi tion elements with whom it can work to topple the regime. Waiting for an in dependent military coup, as the Bush Administration discarered in Panama maybewishfulthinking CONCLUSION The embargo is a powerful leve r but not a sure-fire means of pushing Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. Although the embargo eventually can devastate the Iraqi economy and weaken the Iraqi military machine, it will not necessarily compel Saddam to reverse his invasion and illegal annexation o f Kuwait. Sad dam HusSein responds better to force than he does to economics.The threat of force or its actual use probably will be necesary to oust Iraq from Kuwait.\n\nWashington therefore should continue the ongoing military buildup in the Persian Gulf.\n\nT he embargo nevertheless can make important contriiutions to the con tainment of Iraqi aggression. It gradually will undermine Iraqs capacity to at tack its neighbors or threaten U.S. forces in the region. Moreover, by driving home the costs of Saddams lea dership, it could encourage Iraqi army officers to turn against Saddam, remove him from power and liquidate his costly Kuwaiti adventure.\n\nHelping Jordan and Turkey. The U.S. should strengthen the embargo by cutting Iraqs air links with countries such as Li i and Yemen, which have violated the embargo. Gaining Jordanian participation should be a high priority goal. Washington should press Japan, Western Euro- and Saudi Arabia to offset Jordanian economic losses with greatly increased foreign aid.\n\nSaudi Arabi a and the United Arab Emirates should be asked to fulW Jordans oil needs at reduced cost. Washington should also ask Egypt to dis patch a milimy force to Jordan to guard against Iraqi encroachment or sub version.The Saudis also should be asked to fund thi s Egyptian insurance Policy.\n\nMore than any other U.S. ally save Britain,Turkey has stepped forward and made large sacrifices to support the U.S. during the Iraq crisis.The only Mus lim member of NAT0,Turkey has permitted American warplanes to operate fromTurkish airfields.Turkey has mobilized troops along its 2oo.mile border 21 Laurie Mylrok, Saddam Was in DeSpcrateTroub4 WoUSbmr Jtnunal, August la, 1990, p.

Washingon must demand that Moscow suspend this aid Sharing the Burden. Finally, Washingon should ask its allies to share more equitably the costs of enforci n g the embargo. Japan ad West Germany, two economic giants that have not contributed milimy units to the multinational forces that are enforcing the embargo in the Persian Gulf, should be asked to contribute several billion dollars in financial support for the operation of those forces. Saudi Arabia, whose oil revenues have been boosted consider ably (probably by more than $2 billion per month) by higher oil prices and in creased oil production, should be asked to channel these chisgenerated oil profits int o the support of the common effort against Iraq. Saudi cash should be slated for Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey, which will be hit hard by joining the embargo, and for the U.S. and other countries that have sent forces to defend Saudi ArabiaThe burden of contai ning Iraqi aggression should be shared equitably by all nations who have a stake in the free flow of Persian Gulf oil.\n\nJameskPhilIips Deputy Director of Foreign Policy Studies The Soviet Union is Iraq's prime source of military support.

                    "title": "Arabian Gulf Cup Football Tournament Sparks Conflict Between Iraq And",
                    "body": "The 25th Arabian Gulf Cup football tournament, held in January 2023 in Basra, Iraq, sparked diplomatic tensions between Iraq and Iran by reigniting the old argument over the use of the name Arabian Gulf, favored by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, as opposed to Persian Gulf, which is favored by Iran. The tournament - which the Arab media refers to simply as the Khaliji (i.e., Gulf) tournament - has been held since 1970, usually once in two years, with the participation of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait), as well as Iraq and Yemen. This year, as in the past, many called it by its official name, the Arabian Gulf Cup, which angered Iran.\n\nThe hosting of the game in Iraq, for first time in 43 years, was also a source of tension, since it reignited feelings of Arab nationalism in the country, which in the recent years has been under Iranian hegemony. Locals in Basra expressed great joy over the privilege of hosting the tournament, and prepared a warm welcome for the many fans from the Gulf who came to the city for the games. Many even hosted fans in their homes for free.[1] In addition, the Iraqi press published many articles that celebrated the sense of Arab nationalism that swept the city during the games, highlighted the tournament's contribution to strengthening the ties between Iraq and its Arab neighbors in the Gulf, and called for Iraq to \"return to the Arab fold.\"\n\nIraqi leaders and politicians likewise welcomed the holding of the tournament in Iraq, and many of them chose to refer to it as the Arabian Gulf Cup. A January 6 post on the official Facebook page of the Iraqi prime minister, Muhammad Shia\ua78c Al-Sudani, reported that Al-Sudani had \"declared the opening of the 25 Arabian Gulf Cup at the international stadium in Basra.\"[2] The leader of Iraq's Sadrist movement, Muqtada Al-Sadr, tweeted a welcoming message to \"the honorable Arab guests from the Arabian Gulf\" who had come to the country for the games.[3]\n\nThe warm welcome given to the Arab visitors from the Gulf, and the use of the name Arabian Gulf by Iraqi officials, were anathema to Iran. On January 7, Iran's Football Federation announced on its website that it intended to lodge a complaint with FIFA about the use of the name Arabian Gulf Cup, stressing that Persian Gulf is the historical name used in all languages and on all maps, old and new.[4] Iranian Majlis member Valiollah Bayati condemned the statements of the Iraqi prime minister and of Muqtada Al-Sadr, and demanded that they apologize.[5] Several days later, on January 11, it was reported that Iran had summoned the Iraqi ambassador, Nasir 'Abd Al-Muhsin 'Abdallah, to express its protest. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian explained that the ambassador had been summoned because of the Iraqi authorities' use of the \"fake name\" Arabian Gulf, and to clarify the Iranian people's sensitivity to the use of the correct name, Persian Gulf.[6] Foreign Minister spokesperson Nasser Kanaani stressed that the correctness of the name Persian Gulf was a historical fact - permanent, documented and undeniable - and that the repeated use of the fake name did not make it legitimate or change the truth.[7]\n\nAnger over the use of the name Arabian Gulf was also expressed in the Iranian press. The daily Arman-e Emrooz published an article titled \"[Iraqi Prime Minister] Al-Sudani Is Following in the Footsteps of Saddam Hussein,\"[8] and an article titled \"Insolence\" in the Iranian paper Mardom Salari complained that \"Baghdad's insolence... has reached the point where Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia\ua78c Al-Sudani has used the fake name Arabian Gulf.\"[9]\n\nDespite Iran's anger, Iraqi Prime Minister Al-Sudani not only failed to apologize but stuck to his position in an interview he gave on Germany's Deutsche Welle channel during a visit to Berlin. Asked whether \"the gulf is Arabian or Persian,\" he replied: \"The [existence of] the Arabian Gulf countries is a fact, and I do not want to address the problems that some people are trying to stir up. We respect every opinion, but today we are part of the Arab system and are committed to maintaining our ties with the countries of the Arabian Gulf. The recent tournament is obviously an opportunity for these countries to get together in Iraq, after almost 43 years.\"[10] The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said in a January 16 statement that Iraq's relations with its surroundings had entered a \"new phase,\" and that the hosting of the games in Basra was \"an opportunity to strengthen the unilateral ties between Iraq and the countries of the Arabian Gulf.\"[11]\n\nOthers in Iraq rejected the Iranian criticism as well. 'Issam Hussein, an official in the Sadrist movement, said that the demand voiced by the Iranian parliament that Muqtada Al-Sadr apologize for using the name Arabian Gulf stemmed from Iran's fear of losing its influence in Iraq, now that the games have brought Iraq closer to its Arab surroundings.[12] Montadhar Nasser, editor-in-chief of the Iraqi online daily New World, said that Iran's summoning of the Iraqi ambassador \"contravened diplomatic norms and is a dangerous precedent reflecting Iran's ambition of interfering in and controlling even the official discourse in Iraq.\"[13]\n\nThe conflict also found expression in the Iraqi press, which, as stated, published articles expressing pride in Iraq's Arab identity and satisfaction over the hosting of the games, which had enabled Iraq to return to the Arab fold and strengthen its relations with its neighbors in the Gulf. These articles claimed that the Arab identity of the Gulf was an obvious historical fact, and that the real reason for Iran's fury was its fear of losing its influence in Iraq. Conversely, other articles attacked the Gulf states and accused them of trying to spark a quarrel between Iraq and Iran. One of these articles even claimed that, during the games, Iraq should have hung its streets with posters of the \"heroes\" of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the pro-Iranian Iraqi militias, chief of them the late Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, heroes who defended Iraq and thanks to whom it was able host the Gulf Cup.\n\nLeft: The football stadium in Basra (Aljazeera.net, January 5, 2023); right: a reception hall for visiting dignitaries in the city (atheer.com, January 6, 2023)\n\nThe following are translated excerpts from some of these Iraqi articles:\n\nIraqi Writer: Iran Was Struck Speechless At The Sight Of The Iraqis Uniting Around Their Arab Brethren\n\nIraqi journalist Iyad Al-Dulaimi contended in his column in the London-based daily Al-Arabi Al-Jadid that the show of Arab solidarity in Basra alarmed Iran and increased its fear of losing its influence in Iraq. The Gulf Cup, he added, may indeed increase the presence of the Arab Gulf states in the country. He wrote: \"...Iran's objection [to the name of the tournament] seems to be motivated by many fears, especially considering that the tournament is officially known as the Arabian Gulf Cup and considering that the Gulf states held it in past years without encountering any Iranian objections to its name... The issue goes beyond a [simple] controversy over a name or a term, as observers might think. Tehran, which had begun to realize that its influence [in Iraq] was waning during the October 2019 revolution,[14] felt it [even] more keenly during the Arabian Gulf Cup, hosted in Basra. Although Basra, like other Iraqi cities, is controlled by Iran's proxies, and despite Iran's efforts to force Iraq away from its Arab surroundings, what happened during this tournament rearranged things in a way that Iran found deeply troubling. The [people of] Basra's sense of belonging to the Arab fold was clear and conspicuous, and their effort, along with all the Iraqis, to welcome their Gulf guests with the utmost respect was very telling.\n\n\"For 20 years, the Iraqi media controlled by Iran's proxies has tried to demonize everything Arab... Iran has invested great efforts in causing the Iraqis to doubt their Arab identity, to the extent of supporting some elements [in Iraq] that say that the Iraqi nation has nothing to do with the Arabs... Had Iran's 20 years of efforts in Iraq borne fruit and caused a rift between the people of Basra and the people of the Gulf, then the Arabian Gulf Cup could have been held without encountering any Iranian objections. But what [Iran actually] saw went far beyond anything it had expected or imagined.\n\n\"The October [2019] revolution was the [first] spark that jeopardized Iran's influence in Iraq, but what happened in Basra [during the tournament] aroused all of Iran's fears about gradually losing its influence [there], which it has built over 20 years with the help of its political, religious, economic, social and even cultural proxies... Iran was struck speechless when it saw the Iraqis unite around their Arab and Gulf brethren - a sight that Iran had deluded itself into believing would not quickly be seen.\n\n\"True, the Arabs made a mistake when they left Baghdad as easy prey for the greedy Iranians... They [also] made a mistake the day [they let] Washington convinced them that it would not leave Iraq as easy prey for the greedy Iranians. Today it behooves them to reorder their priorities, for Iraq does not need their support or money. It only needs them to come back to it, so it can come back to them... The Arabian Gulf Cup in Basra may be an opening for greater Arab Gulf presence in Iraq, especially given that the current Iraqi government does not object to such presence in any way, even if it angers Iran. It realizes that this Arab Gulf presence can first of all help change Iraq's stereotyped image, and can also help the Iraqi public feel like an integral part of the Arab fold.\"[15]\n\nIraqi Columnist: The Tournament Was A Political Celebration That Highlighted Iraq's Arab Identity\n\nMazen Al-Hassouni, a columnist for the independent Iraqi daily Sawt Al-Iraq, also held that Iran is concerned about the growing ties between Iraq and its Arab neighbors, which was reflected in the warm welcome given by the people of Basra to the guests from the Gulf and in the general atmosphere during the tournament. He wrote: \"This is the first time in over 50 years since the first Gulf Cup that Iran has appealed to FIFA to express objections to the tournament's name... I believe that the main reason for this, alongside other reasons, is its fear of the strong bond among the people of the Gulf region, which was revealed in this tournament, and of the significant popular warmth [that exists] between the people of the Gulf and the Iraqis. This indicates that all the attempts of the Gulf sheikhs and of sectarian [i.e., Shi'ite] Islamic Iraqi parties cultivated by Iran to drive a wedge between the Iraqis and their brothers in the Gulf never bore fruit. On the contrary, we saw and heard [mutual] praise and eagerness to strengthen the fraternity and closeness between the two sides - the Iraqis and the peoples of the Gulf - despite all the attempts to sow religious and sectarian division [among them]. Iran also remembers the position of the Gulf [states] that supported Iraq during the first Gulf war, and fears that this relationship may reemerge...\n\n\"Basra and its residents, who shouldered the great responsibility of showcasing the character of the Iraqi people - its kindness, generosity and patriotism - to the other peoples, discharged this duty in an exemplary manner, so much so that the guests from the Gulf were embarrassed by this spontaneous giving, which reflected the authenticity of these virtues despite all the poverty and deprivation the city has suffered...\n\n\"These people's great love is given only to Iraq. It is this love that unites them and scares the sectarian [i.e., Shi'ite] forces and their supporters abroad [i.e., Iran]. This was not [just] a football tournament - it was an opportunity to express the Iraqis' joy and unity, break the political and social barriers of fear and eliminate all the foreign and bad values that the [pro-Iranian] parties of destruction, corruption and oppression wanted to establish over [the ruins] of our people's heritage. They did not realize the tournament would take such a direction against them and against everything they built over the unfortunate years of their rule.\n\n\"Bravo to our people... Bravo to the people of Basra who showed kindness, honor, sincerity and fraternity towards others, regardless of their identity, nationality, religion and ethnicity, because that is how they have been raised for generations. Bravo, for they are restoring Basra to its true [Arab] origins, which all the filthy foreign cultures imported by the [pro-Iranian] parties of oppression and ignorance that control the city and Iraq have not [managed to] eradicate. Did I not say that this was not just a football tournament? It was a political, social and cultural festival and a clear and open declaration by the Iraqis, who yearn for a real change that will reemphasize their original identity.\"[16]\n\nArabs roll out red rug for Iraq to return to the Arab fold, and Iran plants mines under it (Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, London, January 21, 2023)\n\nIraqi Columnist: Iran Believes Iraq Is Part Of Its Territory And Wants To Prevent Its Return To The Arab Fold\n\nAhmad Sadiq, also a columnist for the independent Iraqi daily Sawt Al-Iraq, wrote that the real reason for Iran's objection to the tournament's name is that it regards Iraq as part of its territory and does not want it to become part of its Arab surroundings again. He wrote: \"...This artificial scandal manufactured by Iran over the term 'Arabian Gulf' exposes, more than anything, its evil intention to sabotage Iraq's return to its Arab surroundings... and its wish for the tournament to fail...\n\n\"The first Arabian Gulf Cup took place in 1970 in Bahrain, and since then it has repeatedly taken place in the Gulf. Iraq has won it three times. In all those cases the tournament was called 'the Arabian Gulf Cup' and Iran never objected to this. So why is it objecting now, when the games are taking place in Basra under the same official name...? I believe that the Iranians feel that, historically, Iraq was an Iranian province and that it must remain so. Iran still maintains this obsolete nationalist and racist notion, that Iraq is part of Iran and must stay that way. We do not forget that, a few months after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, one of Iran's turbaned mullahs proudly and arrogantly declared that Iraq is an Iranian province and an inherent part of Iranian territory.\n\n\"The Gulf states believe that the Gulf is exclusively Arab, and are not thinking of crossing over to the Iranian [camp], whereas Iran believes that the Gulf is Persian and is thinking of crossing it and extending [its influence zone] to the states on its other side.\"[17]\n\nColumnist For Iraqi Daily: The Name Arabian Gulf Reflects A Solid Geographical And Historical Reality\n\nIn a column titled \"The Gulf Will Forever Be Blatantly Arab\" in the Iraqi daily Al-Zaman, 'Amar Al-Rabi'i argued that the name Arabian Gulf is supported by historical and geographical facts. He wrote:\n\n\"It is strange that some people call the Arabian Gulf by other names based on false and fraudulent reasons. [The Gulf] has been called by various names since the times before Christ, but none of them associate it with a non-Arab country. All these names imply that it is Arab, such as the name Chaldean Sea. Who were the Chaldeans? Were then not Arabs?!\n\n\"Yet some people use various expressions and names as they see fit. That is their business, but it does not change the facts, which have been in place since before the birth of Christ... Maps from 1634 call it the 'Arabian Gulf' in Latin, and the Byzantines used the same name. The one who coined it was first-century Roman historian Pliny the Younger... The name Sea of Basra goes back to the time of the Islamic victory in the era of the Righteous Caliph 'Omar Al-Khattab, and it was also used by the first grammarians, such as Al-Khalil Bin Ahmad Al-Farahidi,[18] geographers such as Yaqut Al-Hamawi,[19] historians like Khalifa Bin Khayat[20] and Al-Dhahabi[21]and several religious scholars. Some of Arabs in the Abbasid Caliphate called it the Gulf of Iraq, but the name Arabian Gulf remained in use [as well]. Dr. 'Imad Al-Hafiz[22] notes that 'the name Arabian Gulf goes back to pre-Islamic times and persisted after the advent in Islam among the people of the Arabian Peninsula and its region. The Ottomans called it the Gulf of Basra'...\n\n\"What lends even more [validity] to this name is the fact that the Gulf has 3,300 km of shoreline, and that only 1,100 km [of shoreline] is in Iran whereas the other 2,200 km belong to the Arab countries on two sides of the Gulf, to the south and to the west, namely the sultanate of Oman, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. On the northern side are Iraq and the Arab [areas] that are currently under Iranian control, such as Arabistan [i.e., Ahwaz] and the three Arab Islands.[23]\n\n\"Moreover, modern studies have begun to stress that calling the Arabian Gulf 'Persian' has no basis in reality, since it has been Arab since prehistoric times. Furthermore, the Arab tribes have been living on either side of it since the dawn of time, and are still living [even] on its northern shore, which is occupied by Iran, despite Iran's policy of Persianization, which is intended to erase their national identity. The widely-used name Arabian Gulf conforms to the established geographical reality, for the Gulf's association with the Arabs was tight, both before and after the advent of Islam... The Gulf will continue to be called Arabian, and all the hollow and baseless claims [to the contrary] are worthless.\"[24]\n\nThe \"Arabian Gulf\" is bewildered by \"the Iranian regime's\" insistence on calling it \"Persian\" (Al-Arab, London, January 17, 2023)\n\nShi'ite Iraqi Journalists Attack Gulf States\n\nConversely, Shi'ite Iraqi journalists supported Iran's position and accused the Gulf states of trying to create strife between Iraq and Iran. Iraq, they said, should actually stress its affiliation with Iran rather than with the Arabs, since the \"heroes\" of Iran's IRGC and of the Iran-backed Iraqi militias are the ones who have protected it and enabled it to survive.\n\nIraqi Political Analyst: If It Were Not For Qassem Soleimani And The Heroic Martyrs, We Wouldn't Have Been Able To Host The Games\n\nIn an article published on the website of the independent Iraqi news agency Buratha, Manhal 'Abd Al-Amir Al-Murshadi, an Iraqi media advisor and political analyst, wrote that the guests from the Gulf should have been greeted with pictures of the \"martyred heroes\": the late Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and the late deputy commander of Al-Hashd Al-Sha'bi, Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, who were killed by the U.S. in 2020, and other slain fighters of the Iran-backed Iraqi militias - since without them Iraq would not have existed today. He wrote:\n\n\"The Iraqi people in general, and the people of Basra in particular, can be proud of the 25 Gulf Cup in Basra. The games' opening ceremony superseded even the opening ceremony of the World Cup in Doha in both its magnificent beauty and its content... Another thing I noticed was the large and extravagant reception halls in which some of the Basra sheikhs welcomed hundreds of guests from Iraq and the Gulf for a festive meal, which, in both form and substance, was more sumptuous than the festive meals held by many presidents, kings and sultans and reflected the endless Iraqi generosity, which befits Iraq...\n\n\"[However], I had hoped that these reception halls and the streets would be hung with pictures of those who defended Iraq's prestige and essence, the victorious martyred heroes [Abu Mahdi] Al-Muhandis, his guest [Qassem] Soleimani, and the [other] martyrs from all the divisions of our armed forces [who followed] the fatwa of the supreme religious authority [Ayatollah 'Ali Al-Sistani].[25] [Their pictures should have been hung] so that the world would know those martyrs... who preserved our prestige, honor and state, without whom we could not have hosted the Gulf [Cup], and perhaps we would not have been here [at all]...\"[26]\n\nIraqi Columnist: \"The Desert Arabs\", The Uncultured Bedouins Who Instigate Quarrels Between Iraq And Iran, Will Not Teach Us The Meaning Of Arabhood\n\nBuratha columnist Na'im Al-Hashemi Al-Khafaji directed harsh words at the Saudis and the other Gulf peoples, saying that these \"desert Arabs\" have always interfered in the internal affairs of Arab countries, including Iraq, and brought disasters upon them, and that today they are instigating strife between Iraq and Iran. He wrote: \"Unfortunately for every Arab country who suffers internal disputes, the desert Arabs [i.e., the Saudis and the peoples of the Gulf states] push their noses into its affairs and cause death and destruction. We have a black and terrifying history [full of such examples, including] their intervention in the Palestinian cause and in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain... The desert Arabs [also] intervened in the affairs of Iraq during the Ba'th era [under] that dead rat Saddam [Hussein]. They instigated unjust wars between us and Iran, and between us and Kuwait, and interfered in Iraq by sending battalions of suicide bombers and [other] terrorists, and by means of the fatwa issued by [Sheikh Yousuf] Al-Qaradawi and by 55 Wahhabi Saudi sheikhs...\n\n\"The name 'Arabian Gulf' is not new. History books may call it the Gulf of Basra, the Arabian Gulf or the Persian Gulf, but that does not in any way change the reality, which is that the Arab and Islamic peoples are fighting one another. What good is Arabhood when thousands of Iraqi citizens are imprisoned in Saudi desert jails, when hundreds of Iraqis are imprisoned in Kuwait and when [the Gulf states] turned in hundreds [of Iraqis] to the intelligence apparatuses of the dead rat Saddam Hussein, to face a fate of execution or murder?...\n\n\"When we see the sectarian [i.e., Sunni] media battalions igniting [conflict] over the name 'Arabian Gulf [Cup]' in order to provoke our neighbor Iran, which has over 2,000 km of coastline along that gulf, [we regard it as] natural. This Bedouin Wahhabi media [also] stuck its nose into the discourse over Iran's summoning of the Iraqi ambassador to protest against the use of the name 'Arabian Gulf' - [even though] the Iranian government actually congratulated the Iraqi team on its win and its ascent to the next stage, and called it 'the sister Iraqi team.' This expression angered the media forces of the takfiri[27] Wahhabi gangs and their mouthpieces. I wish the Saudi regime would change its policy of accusing the Shi'ites of heresy, omit fatwas that accuse them of heresy, which are learned in Saudi Arabia's state schools, and stop spreading lies against the Shi'ites in the official Wahhabi Islamic universities. [Only] when the Saudi regime starts regarding its Shi'ite citizens as equal, and stops accusing the Shi'ites in the Arab countries, including in Iraq, of heresy, will it be entitled to talk about the Arabhood of Iraq and of the Shi'ites. We are Arabs, no matter what the reactionary Arab countries that are agents of imperialism think about it, and we do not need the imperialist agents to provide us with proof that we are Arabs and Muslims...",

                    "body": "In-depth: This International Women's Day, and 20 years after the US invasion of Iraq, the post-2003 state still does not have the capacity to ensure gendered security.\n\nIn January, a 22-year-old Iraqi YouTube star Tiba Al-Ali was strangled to death by her father in an \"honour killing,\" the latest case of the quotidian violence the nation has endured over the last two decades.\n\nHer death sparked outrage and protests across the country, with activists calling for laws to prohibit violence against women.\n\nInternational Women's Day 2023 coincides with another milestone: the start of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, which began two decades ago this month.\n\nFor decades, Iraqis, particularly women, have endured violence from a myriad of sources, not only from foreign occupying forces, but Iraqi criminal gangs, militias, tribes, and family members in the form of honour killings or domestic abuse, in addition to the new security organs of the state.\n\nThe Islamic State (IS) group, which evolved in 2014 out of Iraq's insurgency, a product of the chaos that followed the disbanding of the military, was responsible for a systematic campaign of gender-based violence (GBV), heightening the risks faced by Iraqi women.\n\nThe past, present, and future of Iraqi women and the gendered violence they face are entwined in the country's long history of conflict, instability, and foreign interference.\n\n\"The past, present, and future of Iraqi women and the gendered violence they face are entwined in the country's long history of conflict, instability, and foreign interference\"\n\nThe pre-2003 era\n\nHistorically, there has been silence around GBV in Iraq. In the 1950s, the poet Nazik al-Mala'ika sought to break the silence on this subject with her poem 'Washing Off Disgrace', in which a young woman is stabbed to death by a male relative in the wake of some actual or imagined sexual transgression on her part.\n\nDuring the years of the Iran-Iraq War from 1980-1988, Iraq had the highest percentage of women in the workforce as a result of the conscription of men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. However, women were forced away from their jobs after the war.\n\nTheir situation deteriorated after the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam Hussein revived tribal traditions as a political tool to mobilise these groups in order to consolidate power. In alliance with conservative religious groups and tribal leaders, new laws impacted women negatively in the criminal justice system, and personal status laws.\n\n\"We have a revival of a tribal culture which accepts the butchering of women to settle scores between them,\" former Iraqi ambassador Rend Al-Rahim, co-founder of the Iraq Foundation, told The New Arab.\n\nThe UN Special Rapporteur for Violence against Women reported that since the passage of these reforms in 1991, an estimated 4,000 women and girls had been victims of \"honour killings.\" This problem continued after the 2003 war unabated, and still persists today.\n\nUnder Saddam Hussein, Iraq's security sector was brutal, and violence, including against women, was primarily inflicted by the state. The Fidayeen Saddam paramilitary group led by his son Uday, for example, was responsible for beheading alleged prostitutes in Iraq's major cities and leaving the heads on their homes as a deterrent.\n\nGendered violence and the US invasion\n\nAfter 2003, violence against Iraqi women increased substantially. Iraq's gendered insecurity continued unabated as the security sector collapsed. The few protections that women had from gender-based violence were weakened in the chaos of the war.\n\nThe presence of US and other foreign forces also posed a significant threat to women, as soldiers were responsible for many cases of sexual violence. The same was true of the new Iraqi security forces that the US trained.\n\nIn the most well-known and horrific incident, the 2006 Mahmudiyya murders, five US soldiers gang-raped a 14-year-old Iraqi girl, murdered her father, mother, and sister, before killing her, dousing the family in petrol, and setting the home on fire to hide the evidence.\n\nAlthough official figures are hard to obtain, honour killings, which were historically prevalent in Iraq, also intensified since 2003 as a weak Iraqi security sector, the law enforcement agencies, and courts, fail to punish perpetrators of these crimes.\n\n\"The failure of the post-Saddam state to provide security for women is a legacy of the 2003 war\"\n\nWomen who sought to escape this insecurity were subject to GBV during their flight. Zahraa Jabbar, an Iraqi student at IE University in Spain, escaped conflict both in Iraq after the 2003 war, and fled to Yemen, only to have to flee there after the 2015 conflict.\n\nShe told The New Arab that as she crossed into Turkey and then into the Balkans, \"women in general, including Iraqi women, were either raped, or smugglers included sex as part of the smuggling fee\".\n\nOne of the most significant factors of the US invasion that continues to undermine women's safety from violence is how the US mismanaged the security sector reform of the Saddam-era forces, disbanding most of them, including the entire Iraqi army. This eventually resulted in the emergence of IS.\n\nThe failure of the post-Saddam state to provide security for women is a legacy of the 2003 war, and multilateral efforts on behalf of the international community are needed more than ever to secure their future.\n\nIS, Yazidis, and sexual slavery\n\nAs of 2018, IS has been militarily diminished since the collapse of its self-declared state.\n\nYet, Yazidi women, an ethnoreligious minority in Iraq and Syria, who were sexually enslaved by the terrorists, still bear the trauma of their ordeal.\n\nWhen IS administered a state from 2014 to 2018, it traded in various commodities. The first was syphoned petroleum, the second was looted antiquities. Enslaved Yazidi women were also treated as commodities, managed by the bureaucracy of this state as \"war spoils\" to be redistributed to its fighters.\n\nIS' crimes were a tragic component of the history of political violence and its impact on women, which continues in the present, in conflicts ranging from Ukraine to gang warfare in Haiti, and, unfortunately, will into the future.\n\nSoldiers, militants, and terrorists engage in sexual violence during conflict for a variety of reasons, but two are actually orchestrated by the leaders of the combatants.\n\nGBV builds morale among the fighters, creating a joint camaraderie of machismo in the form of collective sexual violence, a macabre \"band of brothers,\" where in the tragic case of child soldiers, boys are allowed to rape women as an incentive.\n\nSecond, sexual violence demoralises the enemy, demonstrating they cannot protect \"their women\". IS implemented this strategy in tandem with the destruction of Syria and Iraq's pre-Islamic heritage.\n\nBoth tactics attempted to forge a homogeneity within their \"Islamic\" state through the destruction of pre-Islamic antiquities or what it deemed as \"non-Islamic peoples,\" thus expelling Christians from Mosul, or enslaving Yazidi women as a means to ensure they will not be able to give birth to future Yazidi children.\n\nLooking forward\n\nToday, structural violence against women is enshrined at the state level. The US touted post-Saddam Iraq as a model state that would inspire a wave of democratisation in the region. Yet Articles 41 and 409 of the Iraqi Penal Code, to this day, permit males to \"punish\" female members of a household.\n\nThe security sector continues to systematically fail to protect women from GBV. In fact, the police allegedly knew beforehand that Al-Ali's life was at risk and failed to take action.\n\nStill, according to Al-Rahim, there is a positive trend as security forces in Iraq have recruited women to serve as an interface with Iraqi women, tasked with countering GBV at the household and community level. The international community could do more to support these issues.\n\nThe UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) has called for greater protection for women in light of Al-Ali's death and a revision of the Iraqi penal code.\n\n\"Today, structural violence against women is enshrined at the state level\"\n\nThe UN's World Health Organization has tried to implement mental health strategies for Yazidi women suffering from trauma only to be stymied by rivalries between the Ministry of Health of Iraq and its rival, the subnational Ministry of Health in the Kurdistan Regional Government. All three will need to coordinate on the national level, along with international and local NGOs.\n\nThis mental health trauma is not only an Iraqi issue. There is a generation of women that have been traumatised by war, conflict, and occupation, including from Iraq, that are dispersed around the world making this a global mental health issue.\n\nTwenty years ago, the US tried to secure the cooperation of the UN, but failed, and invaded Iraq unilaterally. Today, multilateral institutions, in tandem with Iraqi civil society, are the nation's greatest hope for the next twenty years.",

                    "body": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country.\n\nThe 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nSudani later said in a statement that his government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region.\"\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in both countries.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nSYMBOLISM\n\nAustin's trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after US forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior US defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani and president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Erbil, as well as the lingering acrimony between the two main Kurdish parties running the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan.\n\n\"Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdish region,\" Austin said following his meeting with Barzani.\n\nAustin also condemned Iran's \"repeated cross border attacks,\" on Iraq.\n\nLast year, Tehran fired missiles at bases of Kurdish groups in northern Iraq it accuses of involvement in protests against its restrictions on women, displacing hundreds of Iranian Kurds and killing some.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. US and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all US forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.",

                    "body": "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said US troops are \"ready to remain in Iraq\" in his remarks during an unannounced trip to Baghdad on Tuesday, according to the US press pool traveling with him.\n\nAustin, the highest-ranking Cabinet official to visit the country since the start of the Biden administration, according to the press pool, said in a statement that he is in Iraq to \"reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq.\"\n\nThe visit comes days before the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq that ousted dictator Saddam Hussein from power.\n\n\"Now looking forward, US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Government of Iraq,\" Austin said. \"And these forces are operating in a non combat, advise assist and enable role to support the Iraqi led fight against terrorism. This is a critical mission. And we're proud to support our Iraqi partners.\"\n\nIraq is an important partner in the ongoing campaign to defeat ISIS. But unlike Syria, where US forces operated alongside Syrian Democratic Forces and other partners, the US military serves in an advise-and-assist role in Iraq, having officially ended the combat mission in Iraq in 2021.\n\nHe added, \"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnerships in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty.\"\n\nAustin met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and is expected to meet other senior officials while he is in the country. The meeting with the Iraqi prime minister was not on camera, according to the pool traveling with the secretary.\n\nAl-Sudani, whose formation of a government ended months of political deadlock and sometimes violent protests, welcomed Austin's visit and signaled ongoing cooperation with the United States.\n\nIraq is keen to \"strengthen and consolidate relations\" with the US, al-Sudani told Austin during their meeting, according to the prime minister's office.\n\nIraq plays a crucial role for the United States in containing Iran's influence in the region. Iran has tried to exert control over Iraq through the use of proxy forces and Tehran's sway with Shia political parties in Baghdad.\n\nBefore al-Sudani's recent rise to power, Shia Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr appeared poised to lead the government following the last elections. Al-Sadr had positioned himself against both Iran and the United States. But al-Sadr failed to form a government because of opposition from rival parties, ultimately opening the door to al-Sudani, who has so far shown a willingness to expand Baghdad's relations with Washington.\n\nAfter his visit to Baghdad, Austin went to Erbil, Iraq's northern Kurdish regional capital, and met with the President of the Kurdistan Region and the Commander in Chief of the Region's Armed Forces, Nechirvan Barzani.\n\nIn a joint press conference, Austin and Barzani stressed the importance of US support for Iraq and the Kurdistan region, with Barzani saying \"mutual interests and principles\" bring the two closer together.\n\nAustin highlighted the cooperation on counterterrorism between the US and the Kurdish Peshmerga in confronting ISIS.\n\n\"Through the Global Coalition to Defeat Daash (ISIS), we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daash (ISIS) and we freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said at the press conference.",

                    "body": "Bangladesh participates in the world's largest tourism fair ITB Berlin 2023\n\nPentagon chief Lloyd Austin said Tuesday he hoped to \"strengthen and broaden\" relations with Iraq, on a Baghdad visit ahead of the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nDefense Secretary Austin also told Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani that US troops were \"ready to remain\" in the country at Baghdad's invitation, a thorny issue that has divided public opinion in both countries.\n\n\"I am optimistic about the future of our partnership,\" Austin told reporters in Baghdad after meetings with Sudani and Iraqi Defence Minister Thabet al-Abbasi.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden out partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty.\"\n\nThe Iraqi premier told Austin he also wanted to \"strengthen and consolidate relations\" with Washington, and underlined Baghdad's commitment to \"maintaining balanced relations with the regional and international powers\".\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime in 2003, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, the arch foe of the United States, in a delicate balancing act for Baghdad.\n\nThe jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria.\n\n- 'Vital work' -\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition forces in late 2021 but some 2,500 American non-combat troops remain deployed to provide advice and training.\n\n\"We must be able to operate safely and securely to continue this vital work,\" Austin said.\n\nIn recent years, bases hosting coalition forces have come under drone and rocket attacks blamed on pro-Iranian factions.\n\nThe Pentagon chief thanked Sudani and Abassi for \"their commitment to ensure that the coalition forces in Iraq... will be protected from state and non-state actors\".\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region.\n\nWhile there, Austin voiced \"his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nAustin also visited Iraq's Kurdistan, meeting with the autonomous northern region's president Nechirvan Barzani, a US ally, in the regional capital Arbil.\n\n\"For the country of Iraq to realize its full potential, Erbil (Arbil) and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis,\" said Austin.\n\nBarzani thanked the United States for \"its continued support to Iraq and Kurdistan; we have common interests with the US in maintaining the security and stability of Iraq.\"\n\nDespite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq has suffered from decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure and public services that have sparked repeated waves of protests.\n\nOctober 2021 elections were followed by a whole year of political vacuum before Sudani was sworn in at the head of a government led by pro-Iran factions.\n\nThe political arm of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) force, made up heavily of Tehran-trained groups, has long demanded the departure of all remaining coalition troops, although its calls have been less shrill since it entered government.\n\nThere had been a sharp deterioration in US-Iraqi ties under the Donald Trump administration following the assassination of Iran's foreign operations chief General Qasem Soleimani along with his Iraqi lieutenant, Hashed number two Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020.\n\nIn the run-up to the invasion anniversary, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock began a four-day visit Tuesday and was received in Baghdad by her Iraqi counterpart Fuad Hussein.\n\n\"IS remains a threat. That's why German soldiers are here... as part of the anti-IS coalition and the NATO mission,\" she told a news conference.",

                    "body": "Within the State Department , many diplomats scoffed at President George W. Bush's democracy agenda. Frank Ricciardone, Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Egypt , mocked it when, in 2005, he told young Egyptians that dictator Hosni Mubarak was so popular he could even win elections in the United States.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton meanwhile sought a reset with Russia, while her aide Jake Sullivan embraced the fiction that Iran was democratic and that flooding so-called reformers with cash could bring the regime in from the cold. In Iraqi Kurdistan , the hostility to democracy meant doubling down on the dictatorship of the Barzanis and turning a blind eye to the corruption in which they engaged.\n\nSTOP GIVING IRAQI KURDS A FREE PASS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\nDiplomats rationalized their embrace of dictatorship in various ways. Realistically, the Barzanis controlled things; they were impossible to avoid. Democracies are messy, and many diplomats believe dictators can deliver. It can be nice to have a one-stop shop. Dictators might also guarantee security. Unstated is they might instigate violence if diplomats talk to their competitors. Many diplomats also condescend that Arabs, Russians, Turks, or Kurds are not culturally capable of democracy. Realists might simply say that the State Department should not let a local desire for freedom and liberty abroad interfere with core US.. interests.\n\nIraqi Kurdistan, however, increasingly shows why ignoring dictatorship and corruption undermines long-term interests.\n\nTwenty years ago, George W. Bush ordered US forces into Iraq to ouster Saddam Hussein. The notion that oil motivated the war was nonsense. Fear of Iraq's weapons programs and terror sponsorship was real. Saddam had already started two major wars. The status quo was not tenable. Sanctions were collapsing, and evidence conclusively shows Saddam planned to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction as soon as freed from the yoke of sanctions.\n\nUpon Iraq's liberation, oil companies moved in. Washington encouraged American companies to invest in Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan for two reasons: First, oil generated revenue for Iraq to rebuild. Second, American companies denied space to Russian and Chinese rivals.\n\nCorruption, however, took a toll. Even more so than in Iraq, oil companies found that the political climate and corruption did not offset potential profits.\n\nThe Barzanis and their Kurdish partners systematically cheated on contracts in the belief that the lack of an independent judiciary would protect them from consequences. Outside arbitration is routinely found against Iraqi Kurdistan to the tune of billions of dollars. ExxonMobil quit. Kurdish politicians say that Houston-based HKN is not far behind. American oil field services companies like Baker Hughes are also abandoning the region. In several cases, the Iraqi Supreme Court decision against Kurdistan's oil law is merely cover for a preordained decision. In the place of American companies, Russia's Rosneft and China's Addax Petroleum and Gezhouba Group have moved in. The Moscow and Beijing-based companies are not constrained by the foreign corrupt practices act, as theIR American counterparts are.\n\nNone of this was preordained, but the U.S. will not pay the price in regional influence for its two decades of ignoring corruption and poor governance. Every U.S. ambassador in Baghdad and consul-general in Erbil saw Iraqi Kurdistan only through the lens of short-term gains; they all ignored the long-term consequence of their actions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA\n\nIn effect, they gifted not only billions of dollars but also geopolitical positioning to America's rivals. That they did so upon the hopes of democracy and liberty only compounds the tragedy. There are no shortcuts nor such a thing as cost-free corruption in international affairs.",

                    "title": "Pentagon chief vows to continue US military presence in Iraq",
                    "body": "The Pentagon chief on Tuesday made an unannounced visit to Iraq where he announced Washington's intent to maintain the military presence that began with the US invasion in 2003 and continued for the 20 years since, leaving hundreds of thousands of people dead.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty,\" US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said upon arrival in Baghdad.\n\nAustin is the most senior official in the Biden administration to visit the country. His visit comes as the Iraqi nation prepares to mark the 20 anniversary of the US-led invasion and occupation that resulted in years of bloodshed and instability in the Arab country.\n\nOn March 19, 2003, the US and Britain invaded Iraq in blatant violation of international law and under the pretext of finding Weapons of Mass Destruction, but no such weapons were ever discovered in Iraq.\n\nMore than one million Iraqis were killed as the result of the US-led invasion, and occupation of the country, according to the California-based investigative organization Project Censored.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted as he landed in Baghdad.\n\nSince the US-led forces ousted Saddam's regime, Iraq has been self-governed under a power-sharing system. The US withdrew its forces in 2011, claiming it had ended its combat mission in Iraq; however, some 2,500 US troops still remain inside the Arab country on what Washington describes as an \"advisory\" mission. Austin, who was a former head of all US military troops in the Middle East, claimed in 2011 that the US forces had achieved their military objectives in Iraq.\n\nIn the meantime, Successive Iraqi governments in the past two decades have forged close political, military and economic ties with the neighboring Tehran government, while Baghdad also maintains its relations with Washington.\n\nThe present Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani said his government's policy is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region.\"\n\nBoth Washington and Tehran provided extensive support to Iraqi forces during their fight against the Daesh takfiri forces who seized huge swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nEarlier this year, the Iraqi prime minister paid tribute to top Iranian anti-terror commander General Qassem Soleimani and his Iraqi military comrade Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who were killed in a US drone strike near Baghdad airport three years ago.\n\nSudani described the targeted US killings of the two high commanders as \"a brazen attack\" on Iraq's sovereignty.\n\n\"The crime of assassinating the 'Commanders of Victory' and their companions represented a flagrant violation of Iraq's territorial integrity and national sovereignty. The targeted killings of the commanders, who had a leading role in elimination of the scourge of terrorism, is an utter disrespect to bilateral agreements [signed between Baghdad and Washington],\" Sudani said during a ceremony in commemoration of the two legendary commanders held in the capital Baghdad on January 5, 2023.\n\nBoth General Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), and Muhandis, the second-in-command of the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), were highly revered across the Middle East because of their key role in fighting the Daesh terrorist group in the region, particularly in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe two commanders were targeted along with their companions near Baghdad International Airport in a US assassination drone strike on January 3, 2020 in a cowardly terrorist attack authorized by then-US president Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Daesh is no longer a formidable force in the region despite still maintaining small militant cells across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.",

(Reuters)\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country\n\nThe 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State (ISIS) extremists after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of US forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin told reporters after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shiaa al-Sudani.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nSudani later said in a statement that his government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region\".\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq, with an additional 900 in Syria, to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\nISIS is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nSupporting Sudani\n\nAustin's trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after US forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani and was due to meet the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.\n\nFormer President George W Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. US and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not in fact exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all US forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nHowever, under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against ISIS.",

The capital and largest city is Baghdad. Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups including Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen, Assyrians, Yazidis, Shabakis, Armenians, Mandaeans, Circassians, Sabians and Kawliya. Around 99% of the country's 38 million citizens are Muslims, with small minorities of Christians, Yarsans, Yezidis and Mandeans also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.\n\nIraq has a coastline measuring 58 km (36 miles) on the northern Persian Gulf and encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain, the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run south through Iraq and into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf. These rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land. The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, historically known as Mesopotamia, is often referred to as the cradle of civilisation.\n\nIraq is a federal parliamentary republic consisting of 19 governorates, four of which make up the autonomous Kurdistan Region. Disputes over the sovereignty of Kurdistan Region continue.\n\nIraq is a founding member of the UN as well as of the Arab League, OIC, Non-Aligned Movement and the IMF.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD (AP) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit Tuesday to the Iraqi capital where he vowed to continue the fight against the Islamic State group until the extremists are defeated.\n\nAustin, whose visit came just days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein, said in statement later that he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet Muhammad Al-Abbasi.\n\nAl-Sudani's office said he and Austin discussed cooperation between their countries in the fight against IS. The Iraqi premier reaffirmed his government's \"keenness to strengthen and consolidate relations with the United States of America at various levels and fields.\"\n\nAustin was greeted on touchdown in Baghdad by Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\n\"We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, using an Arabic name for IS. \"The United State remains committed to this fight in support of Iraq's security and the security of the entire region.\"\n\nAustin also said that U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces are operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the \"Iraqi-led fight against terrorism.\"\n\n\"This is a critical mission and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners,\" said Austin, one of the most senior Biden administration officials to visit Iraq in recent years.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed longtime dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted upon arrival.\n\n\"We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region,\" Austin said, referring to Iraq's improving its relations with Arab countries.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months.\n\nMore from this section AHA News: After a Heart Attack, He Ran a 17-Mile Trek Through the Grand Canyon - Twice Health Highlights: March 7, 2023 Boosting Gender Parity Helps Women and Men Live Longer: Study\n\nIn a related issue, the U.S. has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, home to tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents in the fenced-in camp. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are women, wives and widows of IS fighters.\n\nA separate, heavily guarded section of the camp known as the annex houses an additional 10,000 people -- including 2,000 women from 57 other countries, considered the most die-hard IS supporters, along with about 8,000 of their children.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past few weeks.\n\n\"Military action alone won't ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh,\" Austin added. \"So let me recognize the Iraqi government's ongoing repatriations of Iraqi citizens from northeast Syria.\"\n\nReading from a statement to gathered reporters, Austin said all countries with citizens in the detention facilities and displaced persons camps in northeast Syria \"must take similar steps.\" He said the U.S. stands ready to continue supporting Iraq and all countries working to repatriate their citizens.\n\nThe U.S. defense secretary did not take questions.\n\n\"We are focused on the mission of defeating Daesh, and we are here for no other purpose. Any threats or attacks on our forces only undermine that mission,\" Austin said, apparently referring to Iran-backed fighters who were blamed for attacks on facilities housing U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nAustin said that he spoke with Iraqi leaders about the long term vision \"for our defense partnership with Iraq, which will outlast Daesh.\"\n\nMroue reported from Beirut.",

                    "body": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country, Reuters reported.\n\nThe 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of US forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin told reporters after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nSudani later said in a statement that his government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region.\"\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State (Daesh), who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in both countries, Reuters reported.\n\nIslamic State (Daesh) is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nAustin's trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after US forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike, read the report.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior US defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani and president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Erbil, as well as the lingering acrimony between the two main Kurdish parties running the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan.\n\n\"Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdish region,\" Austin said following his meeting with Barzani.\n\nAustin also condemned Iran's \"repeated cross border attacks,\" on Iraq.\n\nLast year, Tehran fired missiles at bases of Kurdish groups in northern Iraq it accuses of involvement in protests against its restrictions on women, displacing hundreds of Iranian Kurds and killing some.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. US and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all US forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State (Daesh), read the report.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq -- U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country.\n\nThe 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin told reporters after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nSudani later said in a statement that his government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region.\"\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in both countries.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nAustin's trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after U.S. forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani and president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Erbil, as well as the lingering acrimony between the two main Kurdish parties running the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan.\n\n\"Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdish region,\" Austin said following his meeting with Barzani.\n\nAustin also condemned Iran's \"repeated cross border attacks,\" on Iraq.\n\nLast year, Tehran fired missiles at bases of Kurdish groups in northern Iraq it accuses of involvement in protests against its restrictions on women, displacing hundreds of Iranian Kurds and killing some.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. U.S. and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.",

                    "body": "In March 2003, U.S. forces invaded Iraq vowing to destroy Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and end the dictatorial rule of Saddam Hussein. When WMD intelligence proved illusory and a violent insurgency arose, the war lost public support. Saddam was captured, tried, and hanged and democratic elections were held.\n\nIn the years since, there have been over 4,700 U.S. and allied troop deaths, and more than 100,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed. Meanwhile, questions linger over Iraq's fractious political situation.\n\nMarch 20, 2003\n\nPresident George W. Bush announces that U.S. forces have begun a military operation into Iraq. \"These are opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign,\" the president says. That initial effort to \"decapitate\" Iraq's leadership with air strikes fails, clearing the way for a ground invasion.\n\nApril 9, 2003\n\nU.S., British, and other coalition forces quickly overwhelm the Iraqi Army, though elements loyal to Saddam who will form the core of a postwar insurgency fight on. Three weeks after the invasion, Iraqi civilians and U.S. soldiers pull down a statue of Saddam in Baghdad's Firdos Square.\n\nIraqi citizens hit a pulled down a statue of Saddam Hussein in the town of Karbala, on the 18th day of the war in Iraq, 2003.

Lawlessness and some skirmishing in the country are written off as the desperate acts of \"dead-enders\" by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nGeorge W. Bush delivering a speech to crew aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, as the carrier steamed toward San Diego, California on May 1, 2003. Photo by Larry Downing/FILE KL/GN/GAC/REUTERS\n\nMay 23, 2003\n\nAfter two weeks on the job, L. Paul Bremer III, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, signs an order disbanding the Iraqi army and intelligence services, sending hundreds of thousands of well-armed men into the streets. The order, coupled with an earlier decision to purge Baathists from the government, has lasting repercussions.\n\nJune 22, 2003\n\nWith violence beginning to coalesce into organized resistance to the U.S.-led occupation, Saddam's sons, Uday and Qusay, are killed by U.S. troops during a raid in the northern city of Mosul. The manhunt that led to their demise had yet to find Saddam himself or many of his top aides.\n\nAugust 19, 2003\n\nA suicide bomber driving an explosives-filled cement mixer destroys the U.N. headquarters in Iraq, killing in the process S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, U.N. special representative to Iraq, and 22 members of his staff. The United Nations immediately withdraws all nonessential employees.\n\nA coffin containing the body of the U.N.special envoy to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, is carried by U.N. workers to a Brazilian plane at the airport in Baghdad, August 22, 2003. Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was killed in a bomb attack in Baghdad, will be brought back to his native Brazil for a ceremony before burial in France. Photo by Zohra Bensemra PA/JV/REUTERS\n\nDecember 14, 2003\n\nActing on tips from the dictator's bodyguard and family members, U.S. troops find Saddam hiding out in a one-man hole near his boyhood home in Tikrit. The capture is heralded by military officials as a possible turning point, and Washington expresses hope that rising violence will abate.\n\nJanuary 24, 2004\n\nThe Bush administration concedes its prewar arguments about extensive stockpiles of chemical, biological, and even nuclear weaponry in Saddam's Iraq appear to have been mistaken. In January 2004, David Kay, the former top U.S. weapons inspector, tells Congress: \"We were almost all wrong.\" A presidential commission concludes in March 2005 that \"not one bit\" of prewar intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction panned out.\n\nWATCH: An Iraqi-American photojournalist's Brief But Spectacular take on refugees\n\nMarch 31, 2004\n\nAl-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) mounts a wave of suicide bombings, striking against Shiite Muslim holy sites in Baghdad and Karbala. The attacks kill hundreds, stoking sectarian resentment. In Fallujah, meanwhile, four U.S. contractors are killed, burned, and hung from a bridge, with video of the slaughter beamed around the world.\n\nApril 28, 2004\n\nEvidence of prisoner abuse inside the U.S.-run Abu Ghraib prison becomes public. Backed by photographic evidence, the conviction of seven soldiers for the torture and humiliation of detainees brings jail sentences. Critics, including some of the convicted, complain that senior officers and officials are spared.\n\nAmerican troops take up positions outside the Abu Ghraib prison west of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad May 5, 2004 as an Iraqi crowd approaches its gates. Hundreds of Iraqis marched outside the walls of the military jail in Iraq where U.S. soldiers photographed themselves abusing Iraqi prisoners, and demanded the release of jailed relatives.

The U.S. government later claims Berg was killed at the hands of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the founder of AQI.\n\nSeptember 8, 2004\n\nWith Iraq's national elections approaching, 15,000 U.S. and Iraqi service members assault the insurgent stronghold of Fallujah in central Iraq. The urban fighting is successful but costly. 38 U.S. troops die, along with six Iraqi soldiers. The Pentagon estimates 1,200 insurgents are killed, and the Red Cross says 800 Iraqi civilians are also among the dead.\n\nAn M1A1 Abrams Tank from 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, fires at a suspected insurgent stronghold in the city of Falluja, 50 km west of Baghdad, in this handout photo released December 8, 2004.

In the fall, Shiites flash victory signs -- with ink-stained fingers -- in front of an image of Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani after voting in Iraq's constitution referendum. Two months later, Iraqis vote for their first, full-term government, giving Shiites majority control of parliament.\n\nFebruary 22, 2006\n\nSunni Muslim extremists destroy the gilded Shiite shrine in Samarra. The attack unleashes waves of sectarian violence in Baghdad's Shiite district of Sadr City that spread across the country. Analysts later point to the Samarra strike as the start of sectarian bloodletting.\n\nApril 22, 2006\n\nDecember 2005 elections bring the Shiite United Iraqi Alliance into power, and in April 2006, the party names Nouri al-Maliki prime minister. Maliki is a longtime Iraqi politician with close ties to Iran. He forms a unity government with Iraqi Kurds and Sunnis the next month.\n\nJune 8, 2006\n\nAQI leader Zarqawi is killed in a U.S.-led air strike near Baquba. His bloody campaign of suicide bombings, kidnappings, and beheadings was deplored by American and Iraqis alike. Washington expresses measured optimism that his death will dampen the insurgency.\n\nA newspaper with the picture of recently killed al-Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi lies with other things on a basket near a damaged house from Monday night's car bomb attack which killed 10 people and wounded 25 others in a market in western Baghdad, June 13, 2006. Photo by Ali Jasim/REUTERS\n\nJuly 9, 2006\n\nIt is widely agreed upon that Iraqi civilian deaths peak in July. But estimates, which hover between 1,000 and 3,500 for that month, vary greatly. The Pentagon declines to keep such statistics. Independent analyses diverge greatly.\n\nNovember 5, 2006\n\nThe trial of Iraq's former dictator ends with a sentence of death by hanging. In the south, Shiites take to the streets celebrating. Sunni militants north of Baghdad vow revenge. In the courtroom, a bailiff attempts to silence Saddam as the verdict \"guilty of crimes against humanity\" is dispensed.\n\nNovember 8, 2006\n\nPresident Bush accepts the resignation of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, who had become a lightning rod for criticism of the conduct of the war. Rumsfeld's replacement, Robert M.

Bush says Saddam received the kind of justice he denied the victims of his brutal regime. A widely circulated video capturing his abuse at the hands of his executioners, however, taints an already controversial verdict in some eyes.\n\nSaddam Hussein sits in court during the continuation of his trail in Baghdad, December 6, 2006.

The Pentagon steps up its recruiting efforts in response, including the signing of newly naturalized soldiers like those, pictured here, who joined the fight during a ceremony at Camp Victory in July 2007.\n\nFebruary 10, 2007\n\nGeneral David H. Petraeus, fresh from leading a rewriting of U.S. counterinsurgency strategy, assumes command of U.S. forces. The West Point graduate takes over a tenuous security situation in Iraq amid allegations that neighboring Iran is supplying deadly roadside bombs to Shiite militants.\n\nJune 1, 2007\n\nU.S. forces begin recruiting Sunni tribe members, many former insurgents, to take up arms against militants working with AQI. The so-called Awakening begins in Anbar Province but spreads to other parts of Iraq. The tactic is credited by General Petraeus and others with helping diminish insurgent violence in the second half of 2007.\n\nAugust 19, 2007\n\nAs security in Iraq's central provinces improves, hopes for calm in northern Iraq are shattered when coordinated suicide truck bombings decimate villages of minority Yazidis, west of Mosul. Hundreds are killed and wounded in the deadliest strike since the beginning of the war.\n\nSeptember 14, 2007\n\nWith U.S.-assisted \"Awakening Councils\" making headway, insurgents target Sunnis now working with the United States. Ten days after meeting with Bush in Anbar Province, Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha, the most prominent figure in the revolt, is killed in an explosion near his home.\n\nDecember 16, 2007\n\nBritish forces relinquish control of Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, to Iraqi forces. The training and equipping of Iraqi security forces to take over security duties is a major coalition goal. In spite of some progress in relatively quiet provinces, more than a year after Britain's handover in Basra, the city continues to be overrun by militants and criminal gangs.\n\nBritish soldiers patrol along a road after a roadside bomb attack in Basra, 550 km (340 miles) south of Baghdad, January 6, 2007. A British soldier was wounded when his convoy was hit by a roadside bomb but his injuries were not thought to be life threatening, Major Charlie Burbridge said.

As the five-year anniversary approaches, nearly 4,000 U.S. troops have died in the fighting, and an additional 30,000 have been wounded.\n\nJanuary 13, 2008\n\nA new law reverses elements of the 2003 \"de-Baathification\" policy and allows some to return to government. But progress lags on achieving other \"benchmarks\" created by Washington, including an oil revenue-sharing law and new provincial elections.\n\nWATCH: Months of political infighting in Iraq prompt widespread protests and instability\n\nMarch 3, 2008\n\nIraq's Shiite-dominated government welcomes Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Baghdad, marking the first time since the bloody Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s that an Iranian president has visited.\n\nMarch 24, 2008\n\nBaghdad and the southern port city of Basra erupt in violence as loyalists to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr attack U.S. and Iraqi security forces. In response, Prime Minister Maliki launches a crackdown on Sadrists, convincing some -- though not all -- that he is a national leader above sectarianism.\n\nApril 23, 2008\n\nBush taps Petraeus to lead U.S. Central Command, placing him in operational control of both the Iraq and Afghanistan efforts. Petraeus's former No. 2, Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno, succeeds him as the new commanding general in Iraq.\n\nSeptember 1, 2008\n\nIn Anbar, once the country's most restive province, the U.S. military hands over security responsibilities to the Iraqis. The move is seen as a symbolic first step toward eventual U.S. withdrawal. Later the same month, Iraq's parliament passes a provincial elections law, clearing the way for voting in most of Iraq's provinces by January 31, 2009.\n\nNovember 4, 2008\n\nBarack Obama, campaigning on a vow to withdraw combat troops in Iraq within 16 months of taking office, is elected the 44th president of the United States on November 4. Three weeks later, the Iraqi parliament approves a pair of agreements outlining future military and civilian relations between Washington and Baghdad, confirming U.S. forces aim to withdraw by 2011.\n\nPresumptive U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) speaks to the audience during a campaign stop at Kettering University in Flint, Michigan June 16, 2008. Photo by Rebecca Cook/REUTERS\n\nDecember 1, 2008\n\nPresident-Elect Obama asks incumbent Defense Secretary Gates to stay on. Gates insists his previous opposition to a withdrawal timetable was made irrelevant by the security agreement approved by parliament in November calling for a U.S. withdrawal by 2011.\n\nFebruary 1, 2009\n\nMaking good on a campaign pledge, President Obama announces plans to remove combat brigades from Iraq by August 2010. His plan will leave a transitional force of 35,000-50,000 soldiers and marines to train, equip, and advise Iraqi security forces until the end of 2011. Seen by many as the beginning of the end of the war, some experts express concern over the pacing, and Gates says Washington should be prepared to maintain a \"modest-sized presence\" after the 2011 deadline if the Iraqis request it.\n\nJune 30, 2009\n\nU.S. combat troops withdraw from Baghdad and other Iraqi cities in accordance with a Status of Forces agreement (SOFA) between Iraq and the United States. More than 150 U.S. bases and outposts in Iraqi cities were shut down ahead of the June 30 deadline. Maliki calls the withdrawal a \"great victory,\" declaring a national holiday, while some Iraqis are skeptical about domestic forces' capabilities.\n\nWATCH: VA secretary discusses health care overhaul helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits\n\nPrior to the withdrawal, some U.S. military officers also expressed concerns about Iraqi security forces' dependence on U.S. troop support and political leaders' overconfidence. Some exceptions to the withdrawal from cities had been negotiated, particularly in the troubled northern city of Mosul and certain areas of Baghdad. The SOFA, which set the June 30 deadline for withdrawal from cities, also sets a date for U.S. forces to fully withdraw from the country by 2011.\n\nDecember 2009\n\nDecember 2009 marks the first full month in which there are no U.S. combat deaths since the beginning of the war. May was the deadliest month of 2009, with 17 combat-related casualties and an additional eight noncombat deaths. In 2009, 149 U.S. troops were killed in Iraq, the lowest annual rate of U.S. military fatalities since the U.S. invasion in 2003.\n\nMarch 7, 2010\n\nParliamentary elections are held on March 7 under stringent security by Iraqi forces. Dozens of explosions rock Baghdad and other Iraqi cities, but voter turnout is over 62 percent. Voter participation is down from 75 percent in the 2005 general elections, as some voters are deterred by fear of violence and doubts about democracy.\n\nU.S. officials call the elections a success and an important step toward withdrawing U.S. troops in the summer of 2010. More than 6,200 candidates from 86 lists participate in the elections, which showcase a power struggle between Maliki's Shiite coalition and former interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's cross-sectarian secular list. Some opposition parties make allegations of fraud, but diplomats and UN officials helping to organize the elections maintain there weren't widespread violations.\n\nAugust 31, 2010\n\nAfter more than seven years of war, 4,400 U.S. casualties, and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians killed, the United States officially ends its combat mission in Iraq. In an address to the nation, Obama underscores the war's shared sacrifices while stressing that the United States will not abandon Iraq. \"In the end, only Iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets,\" Obama said. \"What America can do, and will do, is provide support for the Iraqi people as both a friend and a partner.\"\n\nREAD MORE: A historical timeline of Afghanistan\n\nWhile combat operations are officially over, roughly 50,000 U.S. troops remain to train and partner with Iraqi security forces. All U.S. forces are scheduled to leave by the end of 2011, though an uptick in violence and an ongoing political deadlock -- six months after the March 2010 parliamentary voting, a coalition government has yet to be formed -- prompts new calls for a reevaluation of Washington's withdrawal timeline.\n\nDecember 21, 2010\n\nAfter more than nine months of political wrangling, the Iraqi parliament approves a coalition government forged by Maliki's State of Law party and several other factions. The agreement keeps Maliki as prime minister and Jalal Talabani -- a Kurd -- as president. But a power-sharing arrangement with former Prime Minister Allawi -- whose Iraqiya party won a majority of seats -- never takes shape.\n\nMaliki names 34 ministers to his cabinet, including rival Sunni politicians, which U.S. officials say reduces the chances that \"disaffected Sunnis will split off and resume sectarian warfare.\" But Maliki refrains from naming heads of the defense and interior ministry, appointing himself the interim head and causing concern about a growing centralization of power. U.S. officials cite the acrimonious relationship between Allawi and Maliki as an obstacle to U.S. troop withdrawal and combating terrorism in the country.\n\nOctober 21, 2011\n\nIn accordance with prior security agreements, Obama announces that the remaining 39,000 U.S. troops will return from Iraq by the end of 2011, marking a conclusion to the nearly nine-year war and \"a new phase in the relationship between the United States and Iraq.\" The president's speech follows the failure of U.S. and Iraqi negotiators to reach an accord on a residual contingent of U.S. trainers. However, Maliki indicates that Iraq will be open to further dialogue on the issue, including on the size of the U.S. training force, the nature of their mission, and the duration of their stay. The primary bone of contention remains the question of legal immunity for U.S. trainers.\n\nDecember 18, 2011\n\nThe last U.S. soldiers leave Iraq, ending a nearly nine-year military mission. Since 2003, more than one million airmen, soldiers, sailors, and Marines served in the country. The costs of the conflict were high: $800 billion from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, with nearly 4,500 Americans and well over 100,000 Iraqis killed.\n\nU.S. troops brought the mission to an official close two days prior with a ceremony in Baghdad. Military forces will be succeeded by a diplomatic mission charged with overseeing U.S. interests in a country still struggling with security problems and deep-seated sectarian divisions.",

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who pledged \"deep solidarity with the Iraqi people and my hope that Iraq will face a future of peace and prosperity and with consolidated democratic institutions.\"",

                    "body": "When Biden administration officials like Brett McGurk, White House coordinator for the Middle East, and Amos Hochstein, special presidential coordinator for Global Infrastructure and Energy Security, pass through Iraqi Kurdistan, top on their agenda is encouraging Iraqi Kurds to sell oil to Turkey . The two senior officials, neither of whom has Senate confirmation, couch their entreaties in U.S. efforts to isolate Russia and Iran .\n\nKurds would be foolish to assume that the two have the full backing of the State Department , let alone the broader U.S. government. For too long, American officials have played in the Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish oil markets to their own benefit.\n\nPeter Galbraith, a Democratic activist, former diplomat, and National Defense University professor, leveraged his Kurdish contacts into oil contracts shortly after Operation Iraqi Freedom. Zalmay Khalilzad, a stalwart of Republican administrations, followed suit. Trump administration National Security Council Director Matthew Zais moved from the White House to become vice president of government affairs for HKN Energy, an outfit with extensive interests in Iraqi Kurdistan, although these may soon be ending.\n\nIt is impossible to know Hochstein's motives, but between the Obama and Biden administrations, he worked both for a Houston liquefied natural gas export company and on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas firm. Unlike many inside the administration, he is no stranger to the private sector.\n\nWhile it may be tempting for foreign officials to believe the word of senior American officials, it is important to differentiate between those confirmed and those unable to meet that standard. Kurdish oil is a tricky business. There are four problems with any policy purporting to encourage Kurdish oil sales through Turkey to Israel or other buyers.\n\nFirst, the Iraqi Supreme Court last year found against the Kurdistan Regional Government's oil and gas law. That was the basis for various Production Sharing Contracts with international oil firms. To encourage deliberate defiance of the Iraqi Supreme Court and government of Iraq has both legal and diplomatic ramifications. It is for this reason that the State Department's top Iraq officers are increasingly frustrated with Hochstein, who uses his energy mandate to run roughshod over sensitive policy.\n\nSecond, the International Court of Arbitration in Paris is prepared to side with Iraq against Turkey and Ankara's dealing in Kurdish oil. The judgment against Turkey for buying Kurdish oil might amount to more than $10 billion. The Iraqi and Turkish governments are engaged in last-minute diplomatic brinkmanship to reach a settlement that would put aside the decision. To encourage Kurdish defiance of Baghdad and dealing with Turkey threatens broader diplomacy.\n\nThird, the logic that trans-Turkey pipelines sideline Russia and Iran is nonsense. Azerbaijan, which ships oil across Turkey for export, openly participates in gas swaps with the Islamic Republic of Iran to make up for shortfalls. Turkey, meanwhile, has become money laundering central for the Kremlin.\n\nFinally, even if Hochstein had the State Department's buy-in for his scheme (and it is unclear he does), Congress does not approve of such empowerment of Turkey. Indeed, while Hochstein has sought to kill the EastMed pipeline in favor of TurkStream, many in Congress prefer to focus on future investment in Israeli, Cypriot, and Greek gas. Prominent congressmen and senators, including committee chairmen and ranking members, find any dealings which enrich and empower Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to be counter to U.S. regional interests.\n\nIt is bad when administrations do not speak with one voice. It is worse when freelancing undermines U.S. interests. The Biden administration needs to get its team under control. Iraqi Kurds, meanwhile, should be very careful as they move forward. Taking the advice of freelancing officials could lead them to a far broader fight with Congress and, down the road, perhaps even sanctions.\n\nMichael Rubin is a former Pentagon official whose major research areas are the Middle East, Turkey, Iran and diplomacy.

                    "body": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit to Iraq on Tuesday and said that the US is committed to maintaining its military presence in the country.\n\nThe US currently has about 2,500 troops based in Iraq to help the Iraqi government fight against ISIS. Austin's visit to the country comes ahead of the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq, which destabilized the region and led to the rise of ISIS.\n\n\"I should underscore that US forces are ready to remain in Iraq, at the invitation of the Government of Iraq, to support the Iraqi-led fight against Daesh (ISIS),\" Austin said in comments to the media while in Erbil, Iraq.\n\nThe US presence in Iraq is a divisive issue, as many are opposed to US troops being stationed there. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani came out in favor of the continued presence in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in January after keeping silent on the issue.\n\nAustin traveled to Baghdad to meet with al-Sudani and Iraqi Defense Minister Defense Thabit al-Abbasi. According to the Pentagon, Austin and al-Sudani \"renewed their mutual commitment to long-term defense cooperation.\"\n\nAl-Sudani's predecessor, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, was under a lot of pressure to get US forces to leave as he came into office a few months after the US killed Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad in January 2020. The strike also killed Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and led to the Iraqi parliament voting to expel US troops.\n\nThe pressure led to Kadhimi working out a deal that led to the US formally ending its \"combat mission\" in Iraq at the end of 2021, changing it to an \"advisory role.\" But the move was just a formality and had no impact on the number of US forces in Iraq as no troops were withdrawn.\n\nThe US presence in Iraq supports the US occupation of Syria, where about 900 US troops are stationed. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley made a rare visit to Syria over the weekend to justify the continued presence. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) has introduced a War Powers Resolution to withdraw all US troops from Syria that the House is expected to vote on Wednesday.",

                    "body": "Twenty years after the launch of the U.S.-led coalition invasion of Iraq, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit to Baghdad on March 7 to meet with the nation's prime minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.\n\nAustin is on a multi-day tour of the Middle East during which he will meet with the leaders of nations that are allied with the United States.\n\nThe focus of Austin's meeting with al-Sudani was to discuss the future of the U.S. troop presence in Iraq.\n\nThere are 2,500 U.S. troops in the country.\n\n\"I just concluded a productive meeting with Prime Minister Sudani and Minister of Defense Abbasi. This was just the latest high-level contact between our governments,\" said Austin to a group of reporters in Baghdad. \"And all of these engagements underscore the U.S. commitment to expanding our partnership with the people and the government of Iraq. We're deeply committed to ensuring that the Iraqi people can live in peace and dignity, with safety and security and with economic opportunity for all.\"\n\nAustin mentioned Daesh in his comments, the terrorist group that in 2014 -- not long after the U.S. pulled most its forces from Iraq -- commenced an offensive that eventually saw the organization control large areas of the country.\n\n\"You know, just a few years ago, Daesh was marching across Iraq, terrorizing its citizens and threatening the stability of the entire region,\" said Austin. \"In response, the United States convened the global coalition of 80 countries, and that coalition responded to the request of the sovereign government of Iraq to work alongside them to defeat this ruthless terrorist enemy.\"\n\nAustin commanded an American army infantry force on the ground during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2011, he led and oversaw the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq following the U.S. declaration that the goals of the invasion had been met.\n\nThe United States announced in early December 2021 that its combat mission in Iraq had ended, but that its troops would stay in the country.\n\nAt that time, commenting on the continued role of the U.S. forces in Iraq, Maj. Gen. John Brennan said, \"as we complete our combat role, we will remain here to advise, assist, and enable the ISF [Iraq Security Forces], at the invitation of Republic of Iraq.\"\n\nCoalition forces, composed primarily of U.S. troops, with the United Kingdom providing the bulk of support assistance, invaded Iraq following former President George Bush's claim that former Iraq President Saddam Hussein and his regime had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nHussein had been given a deadline to step down as president or face military action. Saddam refused to vacate the presidency, and ordered his forces to oppose an invasion; and he went into hiding.\n\nAlthough the United States and its allies crushed Saddam's forces in three weeks, with relatively few casualties, guerilla attacks continued on coalition forces and American soldiers continued to see heavy combat and suffer death and injury.\n\nU.S. soldiers captured Saddam Hussein in early December 2013, and turned him over to the new Iraqi government, which tried him for crimes against humanity. He was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging, with the sentence carried out on the morning of Dec. 30, 2006.",

                    "body": "SECRETARY OF DEFENSE LLOYD J. AUSTIN III: Mr. President, it's been great to see you today. And it's great to be back in Erbil.\n\nFor decades, we have worked shoulder to shoulder, including through some very, very difficult times, from Operation Provide Comfort to our ongoing and shared fight against Daesh.\n\nWorking together, the United States and Iraq, including the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, have taken great strides to restore Iraqi sovereignty.\n\nThrough the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh, we have liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from the nightmare of Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis. So let me applaud the invaluable contributions to this fight made by the Kurdish Peshmerga, as part of Iraq's Security Forces.\n\nNow, I should underscore that U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq, at the invitation of the Government of Iraq, to support the Iraqi-led fight against Daesh. And we're glad to be able to support your forces and defend the Iraqi people.\n\nI also want to express my support for the Memorandum of Understanding that the Department of Defense signed last year with your Ministry of Peshmerga. That memorandum affirms our readiness to continue providing security assistance to your forces while we work together on institutional reforms.\n\nDaesh continues to threaten the lives and livelihoods of Iraq's citizens, so our continued cooperation is essential. And so is the Kurdish Peshmerga's coordination with the Iraqi Security Forces, including on Joint Brigades.\n\nUnfortunately, Daesh is not the only threat that this region faces. The United States condemns the repeated cross-border attacks from Iran. These attacks violate Iraqi sovereignty, put Iraqi lives in danger, and hold the Iraqi people back.\n\nThe United States will continue to stand with the people of Iraq. For the country of Iraq to realize its full potential, Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis. And Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdistan region.\n\nAnd so Mr. President, thanks again to you and your team for having us. And thanks for such a great discussion today. We look forward to continuing to strengthen our partnership even further.",

Iraq has endured two decades of chaos and bloodshed since the US toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\n\u00a9 Iraqi Prime Ministry Press Office/AA/picture alliance Secretary Austin's visit is seen as a signal of support for PM Sudani's resistance to Iranian influence in Iraq\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit to Baghdad Tuesday, where he met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, saying he hoped to \"strengthen and broaden relations\" on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of the country.\n\nAustin told Sudani US troops were \"ready to remain\" in Iraq at Baghdad's invitation.\n\n\"I am optimistic about the future of our partnership. The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden out partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty\" Austin said as he spoke to reporters after meetings with Prime Minister Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet al-Abbasi.\n\nPrime Minister Sudani conveyed to Austin Iraq's shared desire to \"strengthen and consolidate relations\" with the US. He also stressed his country's commitment to \"maintaining balanced relations with regional and international powers.\"\n\n\u00a9 Karim Sahib/dpa/picture alliance Iraq has been mired in violence and political division since the US invaded in March 2003\n\nWhy are US troops still in Iraq?\n\nThough Iraq announced the official end of combat operations in late 2021, some 2,500 US troops are currently stationed there to provide training.\n\nAustin said it was important that the US \"be able to operate safely and securely to provide this vital work.\"\n\nAustin also made a point of thanking Sudani and Abbasi for \"their commitment to ensure that the coalition forces in Iraq.\" He added that Iraq \"will be protected from state and non-state actors.\"\n\nSecurity in the region has been a concern since the US led an invasion of the country in 2003, toppling then leader Saddam Hussein and creating a power vacuum that has remained volatile.\n\nOpinions in both the US and Iraq have been divided over the continued presence of US combat troops in the Middle Eastern nation.\n\n\u00a9 Safin Hamed/AFP/Getty Images Austin (l) also met with Nechirvan Barzani (r), the president of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region during his visit\n\nAustin urges Kurds and Iraqis to come together\n\nAustin and Sudani also met with Nechirvan Barzani, the president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. Among other things, Erbil and Baghdad have long been at loggerheads over Iraq's budget and oil revenue sharing between the national and regional governments.\n\n\"Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis, and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdish region,\" Austin said after talks with Barzani.\n\nA US war of choice with a massive price tag\n\nIraq has experienced two decades of chaos since the George W. Bush administration chose to expand its \"War on Terror\" and launch a highly contentious ground invasion of the country on March 20, 2003, justifying the decision with questionable claims that Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nNo such weapons were ever found.\n\nThe country, which had been ruled by a Sunni-Arab government under Saddam, has been governed under various power-sharing administrations since his ouster.\n\nMany of those successive governments have forged closer ties with Iraq's Shia neighbor, Iran -- an archenemy of the US.\n\nThe instability of the security situation coupled with political gridlock have led to an underinvestment in infrastructure and public services despite Iraq having vast oil and gas reserves.\n\nAustin, who was the last commanding general of US forces in Iraq, is the highest-ranking member of President Joe Biden's administration to travel to Iraq.\n\njs/ar (AFP, Reuters)\n\nRead more",

                    "body": "Lloyd Austin said he was \"optimistic\" about the future during the unannounced visit. Iraq has endured two decades of chaos and bloodshed since the US toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit to Baghdad Tuesday, where he met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, saying he hoped to \"strengthen and broaden relations\" on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of the country.\n\nAustin told Sudani US troops were \"ready to remain\" in Iraq at Baghdad's invitation.\n\n\"I am optimistic about the future of our partnership. The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden out partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty\" Austin said as he spoke to reporters after meetings with Prime Minister Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet al-Abbasi.\n\nPrime Minister Sudani conveyed to Austin Iraq's shared desire to \"strengthen and consolidate relations\" with the US. He also stressed his country's commitment to \"maintaining balanced relations with regional and international powers.\"\n\nThough Iraq announced the official end of combat operations in late 2021, some 2,500 US troops are currently stationed there to provide training.\n\nAustin said it was important that the US \"be able to operate safely and securely to provide this vital work.\"\n\nAustin also made a point of thanking Sudani and Abbasi for \"their commitment to ensure that the coalition forces in Iraq.\" He added that Iraq \"will be protected from state and non-state actors.\"\n\nSecurity in the region has been a concern since the US led an invasion of the country in 2003, toppling then leader Saddam Hussein and creating a power vacuum that has remained volatile.\n\nOpinions in both the US and Iraq have been divided over the continued presence of US combat troops in the Middle Eastern nation.\n\nAustin and Sudani also met with Nechirvan Barzani, the president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. Among other things, Erbil and Baghdad have long been at loggerheads over Iraq's budget and oil revenue sharing between the national and regional governments.\n\n\"Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis, and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdish region,\" Austin said after talks with Barzani.\n\nIraq has experienced two decades of chaos since the George W. Bush administration chose to expand its \"War on Terror\" and launch a highly contentious ground invasion of the country on March 20, 2003, justifying the decision with questionable claims that Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nNo such weapons were ever found.\n\nThe country, which had been ruled by a Sunni-Arab government under Saddam, has been governed under various power-sharing administrations since his ouster.\n\nMany of those successive governments have forged closer ties with Iraq's Shia neighbor, Iran -- an archenemy of the US.\n\nThe instability of the security situation coupled with political gridlock have led to an underinvestment in infrastructure and public services despite Iraq having vast oil and gas reserves.\n\nAustin, who was the last commanding general of US forces in Iraq, is the highest-ranking member of President Joe Biden's administration to travel to Iraq.",

                    "body": "Baghdad: Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said on Tuesday he hoped to \"strengthen and broaden\" relations with Iraq, on a Baghdad visit ahead of the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nDefense Secretary Austin also told Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani that US troops were \"ready to remain\" in the country at Baghdad's invitation, a thorny issue that has divided public opinion in both countries.\n\nThe visit, which had not been publicly announced in advance, comes ahead of the March 20 anniversary of the ground invasion that started two decades of bloodshed which Iraq is only now beginning to exit.\n\n\"I am optimistic about the future of our partnership,\" Austin told reporters in Baghdad after meetings with Sudani and Iraqi Defence Minister Thabet al-Abbasi.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden out partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty.\"\n\nThe Iraqi premier told Austin he also wanted to \"strengthen and consolidate relations\" with Washington, and underlined Baghdad's commitment to \"maintaining balanced relations with the regional and international powers\".\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime in 2003, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, the arch foe of the United States, in a delicate balancing act for Baghdad.\n\nBoth Washington and Tehran provided extensive support during Iraq's fightback against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, who overran swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nThe jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria.\n\n'Vital work'\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition forces in late 2021 but some 2,500 American non-combat troops remain deployed to provide advice and training.\n\n\"We must be able to operate safely and securely to continue this vital work,\" Austin said.\n\nIn recent years, bases hosting coalition forces have come under drone and rocket attacks blamed on pro-Iranian factions.\n\nThe Pentagon chief thanked Sudani and Abassi for \"their commitment to ensure that the coalition forces in Iraq... will be protected from state and non-state actors\".\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region.\n\nWhile there, Austin voiced \"his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nAustin also visited Iraq's Kurdistan, meeting with the autonomous northern region's president Nechirvan Barzani, a US ally.\n\n\"We thank the United States for its continued support to Iraq and Kurdistan; we have common interests with the US in maintaining the security and stability of Iraq,\" said Barzani.\n\nDespite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq has suffered from decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure and public services that have sparked repeated waves of protests.\n\nOctober 2021 elections were followed by a whole year of political vacuum before Sudani was sworn in at the head of a government led by pro-Iran factions.\n\nThe political arm of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) force, made up heavily of Tehran-trained groups, has long demanded the departure of all remaining coalition troops, although its calls have been less shrill since it entered government.\n\nThere had been a sharp deterioration in US-Iraqi ties under the Donald Trump administration following the assassination of Iran's foreign operations chief General Qasem Soleimani along with his Iraqi lieutenant, Hashed number two Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020.\n\nIn the run-up to the invasion anniversary, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock began a four-day visit on Tuesday and was received in Baghdad by her Iraqi counterpart Fuad Hussein.\n\n\"IS remains a threat. That's why German soldiers are here... as part of the anti-IS coalition and the NATO mission,\" she told a news conference.",

                    "body": "Defense Secretary Austin also told Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani that US troops were \"ready to remain\" in the country at Baghdad's invitation, a thorny issue that has divided public opinion in both countries.\n\nThe visit, which had not been publicly announced in advance, comes ahead of the March 20 anniversary of the ground invasion that started two decades of bloodshed which Iraq is only now beginning to exit.\n\n\"I am optimistic about the future of our partnership,\" Austin told reporters in Baghdad after meetings with Sudani and Iraqi Defence Minister Thabet al-Abbasi.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden out partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty.\"\n\nThe Iraqi premier told Austin he also wanted to \"strengthen and consolidate relations\" with Washington, and underlined Baghdad's commitment to \"maintaining balanced relations with the regional and international powers\".\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime in 2003, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, the arch foe of the United States, in a delicate balancing act for Baghdad.\n\nBoth Washington and Tehran provided extensive support during Iraq's fightback against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, who overran swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nThe jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria.\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition forces in late 2021 but some 2,500 American non-combat troops remain deployed to provide advice and training.\n\n\"We must be able to operate safely and securely to continue this vital work,\" Austin said.\n\nIn recent years, bases hosting coalition forces have come under drone and rocket attacks blamed on pro-Iranian factions.\n\nThe Pentagon chief thanked Sudani and Abassi for \"their commitment to ensure that the coalition forces in Iraq... will be protected from state and non-state actors\".\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region.\n\nWhile there, Austin voiced \"his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nAustin also visited Iraq's Kurdistan, meeting with the autonomous northern region's president Nechirvan Barzani, a US ally.\n\n\"We thank the United States for its continued support to Iraq and Kurdistan; we have common interests with the US in maintaining the security and stability of Iraq,\" said Barzani.\n\nDespite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq has suffered from decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure and public services that have sparked repeated waves of protests.\n\nOctober 2021 elections were followed by a whole year of political vacuum before Sudani was sworn in at the head of a government led by pro-Iran factions.\n\nThe political arm of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) force, made up heavily of Tehran-trained groups, has long demanded the departure of all remaining coalition troops, although its calls have been less shrill since it entered government.\n\nThere had been a sharp deterioration in US-Iraqi ties under the Donald Trump administration following the assassination of Iran's foreign operations chief General Qasem Soleimani along with his Iraqi lieutenant, Hashed number two Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020.\n\nIn the run-up to the invasion anniversary, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock began a four-day visit Tuesday and was received in Baghdad by her Iraqi counterpart Fuad Hussein.\n\n\"IS remains a threat. That's why German soldiers are here... as part of the anti-IS coalition and the NATO mission,\" she told a news conference.",

                    "body": "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin [Lukas Kabon - Anadolu Agency]\n\nUS Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country, Reuters reports.\n\nThe 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Daesh militants after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of US forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin told reporters after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister, Mohammed Al-Sudani.\n\nREAD: PM: Iraq doesn't need foreign armies, just security exchanges\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nSudani later said in a statement that his government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region\".\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Daesh which, in 2014, seized swathes of territory in both countries.\n\nDaesh is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and north-eastern Syria.\n\nSymbolism\n\nAustin's trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after US forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards Commander-General, Qassem Soleimani, in a drone strike.\n\nREAD: Iraq: Government orders audit of officials funds\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani and President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Erbil, as well as the lingering acrimony between the two main Kurdish parties running the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan.\n\n\"Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis, and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdish region,\" Austin said following his meeting with Barzani.\n\nAustin also condemned Iran's \"repeated cross border attacks\" on Iraq.\n\nLast year, Tehran fired missiles at bases of Kurdish groups in northern Iraq it accuses of involvement in protests against its restrictions on women, displacing hundreds of Iranian Kurds and killing some.\n\nFormer President, George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. US and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all US forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut, under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria, three years later to bolster the fight against Daesh.",

                    "body": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin meets with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in Baghdad. - Iraqi Prime Minister's Office\n\nNearly 20 years after he led the last US battalions out of Iraq in 2011, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin landed in Baghdad on Wednesday to discuss the future of the US troop presence in the country with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Austin said that the remaining 2,500 troops in the country as part of the mission to defeat the Islamic State were \"ready to remain\" there at the behest of the Iraqi government.\n\n\"Now looking forward, US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin said according to reporters traveling with him.\n\n\"These forces are operating in a non-combat, advise, assist and enable role to support the Iraqi-led fight against terrorism,\" the US defense chief said.\n\nBetween the lines: Sudani's office said in a statement following the meeting that the prime minister seeks a balanced approach to regional and international relations -- a reference to the US and Iran -- \"based on common interests and respect for sovereignty.\"\n\n\"The stability of Iraq is a key to the region's security and stability,\" Sudani's statement read.\n\nSince taking office last October, the Iraqi premier has walked a tightrope between his political backers in the predominately Shiite Coordination Framework and the United States, which seeks to limit certain elements of Iran's influence in Iraq.\n\nLow profile: Pentagon officials requested Al-Monitor and other outlets keep Austin's visit to Iraq under wraps until arrival due to security concerns.\n\nTwo decades after the US removal of Saddam Hussein from power triggered the violent collapse of Iraqi society, the country's security situation appears to have largely stabilized. But the central government in Baghdad remains dependent on outside support, rendering Iraq a tense site of contestation for clout between Washington and Tehran.\n\nUS defense officials say Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps continues to arm and fund proxy militias in Iraq and other countries in the Middle East as it seeks leverage over the United States and its allies.\n\nWashington has accused Iran-backed groups -- some of which are represented in Sudani's coalition in parliament -- of launching repeated rocket attacks against US and coalition forces in Iraq in recent years amid the Donald Trump administration's \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Tehran and the January 2020 assassination of IRGC Quds Force chief Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad.\n\nBut Iran-backed groups have largely held off on attacking US forces in Iraq in recent months, in what Pentagon officials describe as a bid to avoid undermining their own political gains in Baghdad.\n\n\"Part of cultivating proxy groups in Iraq is to hold at risk the Iraqi government,\" a senior US defense official told reporters at the Pentagon ahead of Austin's visit. \"Part of this is to threaten US partners with coercive tactics,\" the official said.\n\n\"And part of it is because there's an ideological orientation of the [Iranian] regime that doesn't want US forces present in the region, and doesn't want the United States to have strategic partnerships in the Middle East so that Iran can dominate the Middle East.\"\n\nThe US roughly halved its troop presence in Iraq in 2020, shifting to a command advisory role as American officials cited progress by Iraqi security forces in conducting the fight against remaining IS networks on their own. The Pentagon also acknowledged continued rocket attacks by Iran-backed militias hastened the drawdown.\n\nIn 2021, US and Iraqi officials announced an end to the US-led combat mission in Iraq. The move was widely seen as intended to relieve domestic political pressure on then-Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi.\n\nThough US troops, notably special operations forces, continue to assist Iraqi security forces during operations against IS, American officials say they are not in the lead. US military personnel supported Iraqi security forces in 33 operations against IS in the month of February alone, according to numbers released by US Central Command (CENTCOM).\n\n\"We -- US forces and the coalition -- remain in an advise, assist and enable role. So there are not unilateral operations. They are partnered operations,\" the senior defense official said.\n\nRewind: Three years after the US withdrew from Iraq in 2011, the Barack Obama administration re-deployed troops to the country at Baghdad's request as Iraq's military faced sweeping conquests by the Islamic State group as part of spillover from the civil war in neighboring Syria.\n\nBoth the US and Iran armed and supported local forces in Iraq to beat back the jihadist organization and retake territory, leading to tense encounters on the ground once IS was largely wiped off the battlefield in Iraq in 2018. But IS sleeper cells remain and continue to conduct attacks on Iraqi security forces from hideouts in the country's rural regions.\n\nWhat's next: Austin headed to Erbil following meetings in Baghdad to sit down with Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government Nechirvan Barzani.\n\nThe US defense secretary is scheduled to travel back to Jordan today ahead of visits to Egypt and Israel on Wednesday.",

                    "body": "SECRETARY OF DEFENSE LLOYD J. AUSTIN III: Well, good afternoon, everyone. It is great to be back in Baghdad today, and I just wanted to say a few words about our ongoing work here.\n\nI just concluded a productive meeting with Prime Minister Sudani and Minister of Defense Abbasi. This was just the latest high-level contact between our governments. And all of these engagements underscore the U.S. commitment to expanding our partnership with the people and the government of Iraq. We're deeply committed to ensuring that the Iraqi people can live in peace and dignity, with safety and security and with economic opportunity for all.\n\nNow, our defense cooperation against Daesh is a key pillar of our bilateral relationship, and the United States remains committed to this fight in support of Iraq's security and the security of the entire region. Prime Minister Sudani and I both reaffirmed that commitment today.\n\nYou know, just a few years ago, Daesh was marching across Iraq, terrorizing its citizens and threatening the stability of the entire region. In response, the United States convened the global coalition of 80 countries, and that coalition responded to the request of the sovereign government of Iraq to work alongside them to defeat this ruthless terrorist enemy.\n\nAnd we'll continue to listen to our partners and rally together with them in this fight. We'll continue to harness the professionalism of the coalition's diplomats and assistance experts and warfighters, as well as the incredible professionals in the NATO mission here. We'll continue to increase interoperability among our allies and partners, and we'll continue working to accomplish this mission together.\n\nThrough the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and we freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip. Now, the Iraqi Security Forces, including the Kurdish Peshmerga, have made huge strides in increasing their counterterrorism capabilities, and today they are in the lead.\n\nBut military action alone won't ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh, so let me recognize the Iraqi government's ongoing repatriations of Iraqi citizens from northeast Syria. As I discussed with Prime Minister Sudani today, all countries with citizens in the detention facilities and displaced person camps in northeast Syria must take similar steps, and the United States stands ready to continue supporting Iraq and all countries working to repatriate their citizens.\n\nNow, looking forward, U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq. These forces are operating in a non-combat advise, assist and enable role to support the Iraqi-led fight against terrorism. This is a critical mission, and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners. But we must be able to operate safely and securely to continue this vital work. So I want to thank Prime Minister Sudani and Minister of Defense Abbasi for their commitment today to ensure that the coalition forces in Iraq, at the Iraqi government's request, will be protected from state and non-state actors. We're focused on the mission of defeating Daesh, and we are here for no other purpose, and threats or attacks on our forces only undermine that mission.\n\nNow, we also talked today about the long-term vision for our defense partnership with Iraq, which will outlast Daesh. We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security, and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region. And so I look forward to continuing to consult with our valued Iraqi partners and to advance our shared interests and to improve the lives of the Iraqi people. I am optimistic about the future of our partnership, and the United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty.\n\nSo once again, I want to express my gratitude to Prime Minister Sudani and Minister of Defense Abbasi for their hospitality today, and again, it's really good to be back in Iraq. Thanks, everyone.",

Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, using an Arabic name for the Islamic State.\n\n\"The United States remains committed to this fight in support of Iraq's security and the security of the entire region,\" he said.\n\nAustin also said that US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces are operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the \"Iraqi-led fight against terrorism.\"\n\n\"This is a critical mission and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners,\" said Austin, one of the most senior officials of US President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq in the past few years.\n\nSince the US-led invasion in 2003 that removed Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the US and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin wrote on Twitter upon arrival.\n\n\"We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region,\" Austin said, referring to Iraq's improving its relations with Arab countries.",

                    "body": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III made an unannounced visit to Iraq on Tuesday to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the country, less than two weeks before the 20th anniversary of the American-led invasion that transformed the Middle Eastern nation.\n\nAfter meetings with Iraq's prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and his top military and counterterrorism team, Mr. Austin assured Iraqi leaders that the United States would press on with the mission of advising and training the country's armed forces.\n\n\"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" he said after meeting Iraqi leaders.\n\nThe 2003 invasion of Iraq ousted the longstanding dictator Saddam Hussein and led to a brutal insurgency against U.S. forces and their Iraqi allies. It set off sectarian warfare and spurred the growth of Al Qaeda in Iraq, later paving the way for the rise of the Islamic State as well.\n\nIt resulted in Iraqi casualties estimated between 185,000-206,000, the vast majority of them civilians, according to the Cost of War project at the Watson Institute at Brown University. Some 4,600 U.S. service members also died, along with more than 3,600 military contractors. In addition, millions of Iraqis were displaced during the fighting, and only some have returned to their homes.\n\nMore on U.S. Armed ForcesPreparing for a Pacific Island Fight: A 10-day mock battle across Southern California gave a new Marine regiment the chance to test war-fighting concepts the Pentagon may one day need in a battle with China.Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: President Biden's list of candidates to replace Gen. Mark A. Milley in the role appears t\u043e be down to two names: Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., who is the Air Force chief of staff, and the 38th commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. David Berger.Military Advisers: American troops are assisting Somali soldiers fighting Al Shabab, a branch of Al Qaeda, in what is the most active front in the \"forever wars\" that the United States has waged since the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nMr. Austin underscored that the current focus of U.S. forces in Iraq is on defeating the Islamic State and made clear that attacks on U.S. forces \"undermine that mission,\" a reference to attempts by Iranian drones to target military camps that house U.S. soldiers in Baghdad and northeastern Syria.\n\nHe reinforced the importance of Iraq continuing its gradual efforts to repatriate those Iraqis with ties to the Islamic State who are currently held in prison camps for Islamic State families in northeastern Syria, such as the sprawling Al Hol camp.\n\nTens of thousands of people live in the camp -- the majority of them women and children -- and about half the residents are Iraqi. The work of reintegrating them into Iraqi communities has been difficult because of widespread concerns that they will once again threaten Iraqi civilians.\n\nAccording to assessments by the U.S. Central Command, the Islamic State has some 10,000 fighters and leaders in detention in Syria in addition to more than 25,000 in the Al Hol camp, adding that they are vulnerable to radicalization.\n\nMr. Austin never mentioned Iran by name. But his warning about attacks on U.S. troops and other comments urging Iraq to deepen and strengthen its partnerships with its Arab neighbors suggested that he was urging Iraq to do its best to counter Iran's influence with ties to other Arab allies.\n\nHussein Allawi, the prime minister's security adviser, said that the United States was committed to giving Iraq \"technical support since Iraq owns U.S.-made weaponry\" and providing special operations training for Iraq's counterterrorism units.\n\nThe United States has 2,500 troops in Iraq and an additional 900 in Syria to help advise and assist allied local forces in combating Islamic State fighters there. In 2014, the Islamic State seized territory in both countries, bringing much of northern Iraq under its control.\n\nIt took more than three years of hard fighting and the help of an international coalition, as well as Iran-backed Iraqi militias to win back the territory.\n\nThe numbers of Islamic State attacks have declined annually since the Islamic State lost its territory in 2017. But some parts Iraq still see near daily attacks with small-arms fire and sometimes improvised explosive devices.",

                    "body": "Defense Secretary Austin also told Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani that US troops were \"ready to remain\" in the country at Baghdad's invitation, a thorny issue that has divided public opinion in both countries.\n\nThe visit, which had not been publicly announced in advance, comes ahead of the March 20 anniversary of the ground invasion in March 2003 that started two decades of bloodshed that Iraq is only now beginning to exit.\n\n\"I am optimistic about the future of our partnership,\" Austin told reporters in Baghdad after meetings with Sudani and Iraqi Defence Minister Thabet al-Abbasi.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden out partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty.\"\n\nThe Iraqi premier told Austin he also wanted to \"strengthen and consolidate relations\" with Washington, and underlined Baghdad's commitment to \"maintaining balanced relations with the regional and international powers\".\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments in Baghdad have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, the arch foe of the United States, in a delicate balancing act.\n\nBoth Washington and Tehran provided extensive support during Iraq's fightback against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, who overran swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nThe jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria.\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition forces at the end of 2021 but some 2,500 American non-combat troops remain deployed to provide advice and training.\n\n\"We must be able to operate safely and securely to continue this vital work,\" Austin said.\n\nIn recent years, bases hosting coalition forces have come under drone and rocket attacks blamed on pro-Iranian factions.\n\nThe Pentagon chief thanked Sudani and Abassi for \"their commitment to ensure that the coalition forces in Iraq... will be protected from state and non-state actors\".\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region.\n\nWhile there, Austin voiced \"his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nDespite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq has suffered from decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure and public services that have sparked repeated waves of protests.\n\nOctober 2021 elections were followed by a whole year of political vacuum before Sudani was sworn in at the head of a government led by pro-Iran factions.\n\nThe political arm of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) paramilitary force, made up heavily of Tehran-trained groups, has long demanded the departure of all remaining coalition troops, although its calls have been less shrill since it entered government.\n\nThere had been a sharp deterioration in US-Iraqi ties under the Donald Trump administration following the assassination of Iran's foreign operations chief General Qasem Soleimani along with his Iraqi lieutenant, Hashed number two Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020.\n\nIn the run-up to the invasion anniversary, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers.",

And the United States remains committed to this fight in support of Iraq's security and the security of the entire region.\"\n\nSince the US-led invasion in 2003 that removed longtime dictator Saddam Hussein from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the few past months.",

                    "body": "U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pledged to continue the U.S. train-and-assist mission in Iraq until the Islamic State (ISIS) is eliminated in a surprise visit to Baghdad on Tuesday, according to media reports.\n\nFollowing meetings with top Iraqi officials that came just days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Austin said that American troops would continue to serve in the country at the local government's request, Reuters reported. The U.S. has 2,500 troops in Iraq and an additional 900 in Syria whose mission is to advise local forces in countering ISIS, which still retains a presence despite losing mass amounts of territory to counterterrorism coalition forces in 2017.\n\n\"We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, according to The Associated Press. Daesh is the Arabic name for the Islamic State.

Some of those groups have fired rockets at U.S. bases and the embassy in Baghdad.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.\n\nAustin is the most senior Biden administration official to visit Iraq, according to Reuters. He formerly served as the last commanding general of United States Forces - Iraq from 2010 to 2011 as the combat mission tapered down before re-surging again under the coalition to defeat ISIS.\n\nThe 2003 invasion succeeded in ousting dictator Saddam Hussein, but ravaged cities, led to thousands of civilian casualties and primed the population for a resurgence of jihadist ideologies, according to Reuters. ISIS quickly found a foothold in Iraq and captured swaths of territory in 2014.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

                    "body": "U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pledged to continue the U.S. train-and-assist mission in Iraq until the Islamic State (ISIS) is eliminated in a surprise visit to Baghdad on Tuesday, according to media reports.\n\nFollowing meetings with top Iraqi officials that came just days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Austin said that American troops would continue to serve in the country at the local government's request, Reuters reported. The U.S. has 2,500 troops in Iraq and an additional 900 in Syria whose mission is to advise local forces in countering ISIS, which still retains a presence despite losing mass amounts of territory to counterterrorism coalitionforces in 2017.\n\n\"We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, according to The Associated Press. Daesh is the Arabic name for the Islamic State.\n\nU.S. troops remain in Iraq in a non-combat capacity and are prepared to continue advising and supporting the \"Iraqi-led fight against terrorism,\" Austin added, according to the AP.\n\nISIS militants have killed or wounded dozens of Iraqi troops in recent months, according to the AP.\n\n\"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin said after a conversation with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani, according to Reuters. \"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty.\"\n\nFor his part, Sudani reiterated his position that Iraq should pursue a foreign policy that promotes balance and stability in the region and is based on respect for nations' sovereignty, according to Reuters.\n\nIn addition to ISIS, several Iran-backed militia groups operate in or near Iraq, according to Reuters. Some of those groups have fired rockets at U.S. bases and the embassy in Baghdad.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.\n\nAustin is the most senior Biden administration official to visit Iraq, according to Reuters. He formerly served as the last commanding general of United States Forces - Iraq from 2010 to 2011 as the combat mission tapered down before re-surging again under the coalition to defeat ISIS.\n\nThe 2003 invasion succeeded in ousting dictator Saddam Hussein, but ravaged cities, led to thousands of civilian casualties and primed the population for a resurgence of jihadist ideologies, according to Reuters. ISIS quickly found a foothold in Iraq and captured swaths of territory in 2014.",

                    "body": "Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said Tuesday he hoped to \"strengthen and broaden\" relations with Iraq, on a Baghdad visit ahead of the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nDefense Secretary Austin also told Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani that US troops were \"ready to remain\" in the country at Baghdad's invitation, a thorny issue that has divided public opinion in both countries.\n\nThe visit, which had not been publicly announced in advance, comes ahead of the March 20 anniversary of the ground invasion in March 2003 that started two decades of bloodshed that Iraq is only now beginning to exit.\n\n\"I am optimistic about the future of our partnership,\" Austin told reporters in Baghdad after meetings with Sudani and Iraqi Defence Minister Thabet al-Abbasi.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden out partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability and sovereignty.\"\n\nThe Iraqi premier told Austin he also wanted to \"strengthen and consolidate relations\" with Washington, and underlined Baghdad's commitment to \"maintaining balanced relations with the regional and international powers\".\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments in Baghdad have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, the arch foe of the United States, in a delicate balancing act.\n\nBoth Washington and Tehran provided extensive support during Iraq's fightback against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, who overran swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nThe jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria.\n\n- 'Vital work' -\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition forces at the end of 2021 but some 2,500 American non-combat troops remain deployed to provide advice and training.\n\n\"We must be able to operate safely and securely to continue this vital work,\" Austin said.\n\nIn recent years, bases hosting coalition forces have come under drone and rocket attacks blamed on pro-Iranian factions.\n\nThe Pentagon chief thanked Sudani and Abassi for \"their commitment to ensure that the coalition forces in Iraq... will be protected from state and non-state actors\".\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region.\n\nWhile there, Austin voiced \"his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nDespite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq has suffered from decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure and public services that have sparked repeated waves of protests.\n\nOctober 2021 elections were followed by a whole year of political vacuum before Sudani was sworn in at the head of a government led by pro-Iran factions.\n\nThe political arm of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) paramilitary force, made up heavily of Tehran-trained groups, has long demanded the departure of all remaining coalition troops, although its calls have been less shrill since it entered government.\n\nThere had been a sharp deterioration in US-Iraqi ties under the Donald Trump administration following the assassination of Iran's foreign operations chief General Qasem Soleimani along with his Iraqi lieutenant, Hashed number two Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020.\n\nIn the run-up to the invasion anniversary, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers.",

Austin was greeted on touchdown in the Iraqi capital on Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq. Austin then met top Iraqi officials, including the prime minister and defense minister. Iraq is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the Islamic State group. Since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed longtime dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit to Iraq on Tuesday, nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and said Washington was committed to maintaining its military presence. Country.\n\nThe 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commander of US forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"US forces are prepared to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government,\" Austin told reporters after meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad al-Sudani.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and expand our partnership in support of Iraq's security, stability and sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nSudan later said in a statement that its government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is critical to the security and stability of the region.\"\n\nThe U.S. currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq -- and an additional 900 in Syria -- to help advise and assist local troops in the fight against Islamic State, which seized territory in both countries in 2014.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells survive in parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nAustin's visit is also to support Sudan's pushback against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militias in Iraq periodically target US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. In 2020, the United States and Iran came close to full-scale conflict after US forces killed the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, General Qassem Soleimani, in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think Iraqi leaders share our interest in not having Iraq become a playground for conflict between the U.S. and Iran,\" said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAustin met with Nechirwan Barzani, president of the Sudanese and Iraqi Kurdistan Region, amid ongoing disputes between the national government and Erbil over budget exchanges and oil revenue sharing, as well as between the two main Kurdish parties operating in the quasi-government. Autonomous region of Kurdistan.\n\n\"Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the benefit of all Iraqis and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdish region,\" Austin said following his meeting with Barzani.\n\nAustin condemned Iran's \"repeated cross-border attacks\" on Iraq.\n\nLast year, Tehran fired missiles at bases of Kurdish groups in northern Iraq it accused of staging protests against its restrictions on women, displacing hundreds of Iranian Kurds and killing some.\n\nFormer President George W. The Bush administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction to justify its decision to invade Iraq. American and Allied forces later discovered that no such stockpiles existed.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Cost of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, the former commander of all US forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the US had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back to Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.",

Mr. Austin stressed that they were there primarily to train and advise Iraqi troops, not to join them on combat missions to root out remaining Islamic State fighters.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) -U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country.\n\nThe 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin told reporters after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nSudani later said in a statement that his government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region.\"\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in both countries.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nSYMBOLISM\n\nAustin's trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after U.S. forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani and president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Erbil, as well as the lingering acrimony between the two main Kurdish parties running the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan.\n\n\"Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdish region,\" Austin said following his meeting with Barzani.\n\nAustin also condemned Iran's \"repeated cross border attacks,\" on Iraq.\n\nLast year, Tehran fired missiles at bases of Kurdish groups in northern Iraq it accuses of involvement in protests against its restrictions on women, displacing hundreds of Iranian Kurds and killing some.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. U.S. and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali in Baghdad, additional reporting by Amina Ismail in Erbil; Editing by Andrew Heavens, Angus MacSwan, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Sharon Singleton)",

                    "body": "\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. Austin met Sudani and president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Erbil, as well as the lingering acrimony between the two main Kurdish parties running the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country. The 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion. \"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin told reporters after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty,\" he said. Sudani later said in a statement that his government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region.\"\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in both countries. Islamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nSYMBOLISM Austin's trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after U.S. forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike. \"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani and president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Erbil, as well as the lingering acrimony between the two main Kurdish parties running the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan. \"Erbil and Baghdad must work together for the good of all Iraqis and Kurdish leaders must put aside their divisions and come together to build a secure and prosperous Iraqi Kurdish region,\" Austin said following his meeting with Barzani.\n\nAustin also condemned Iran's \"repeated cross border attacks,\" on Iraq. Last year, Tehran fired missiles at bases of Kurdish groups in northern Iraq it accuses of involvement in protests against its restrictions on women, displacing hundreds of Iranian Kurds and killing some.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. U.S. and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist. Between 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq. But under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said US troops are \"ready to remain in Iraq\" in his remarks during an unannounced trip to Baghdad on Tuesday, according to the US press pool traveling with him.\n\nIn a statement cited by the CNN, Austin said that he is in Iraq to \"reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq.\"\n\n\"Now looking forward, US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Government of Iraq,\" he said.\n\n\"And these forces are operating in a non combat, advise assist and enable role to support the Iraqi led fight against terrorism. This is a critical mission. And we're proud to support our Iraqi partners.\"\n\nAustin met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani and is expected to meet other senior Iraqi officials. The meeting with the Iraqi prime minister was not on camera, according to the press pool traveling with the secretary.\n\nAfter his visit to Baghdad, the Pentagon chief will return to Amman, Jordan, where he started his trip to the Middle East on Sunday.\n\nAustin is the highest-ranking Cabinet official to visit the country since the start of the President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nIn remarks on Saturday, Iraqi PM Al-Sudani stressed that Iraq does not need the combat forces of any country, while it needs their intelligence and training advisories.\n\nIn January 2020, the Iraqi Parliament passed a resolution calling on the government to expel foreign troops from the country, in the wake of the US strike which killed senior commanders in the Axis of Resistance General Qassem Suleimani and Abu Mahdi AL-Muhandis near Baghdad Airport.",

In a tweet, after landing in Baghdad, the US Defense Secretary said, his visit aims to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as they move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq. His visit comes ahead of the 20th March anniversary of the ground invasion by the United States which ushered in two decades of bloodshed that Iraq is only now beginning to exit. In the run-up, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers. Since US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system. Successive governments have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, while Iraq also maintains relations with the United States,in a delicate balancing act.\n\nBefore reaching Iraq, the US Defense Secretary held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region. Pentagon in a statement said, Secretary Austin shared his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including, maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region.",

The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after US forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior US defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nMr Austin met Mr Sudani and will meet the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. US and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nLloyd Austin, a former head of all US forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nFeatured Video Of The DayMaharashtra Farmer Burns Own Onion Crop After Not Getting Right Prices",

                    "body": "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III made an unannounced visit Tuesday to the Iraqi capital, where he vowed to continue the fight against Islamic State until the extremists are defeated.\n\n\u00a9 (ASSOCIATED PRESS) Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has made an unannounced visit to Baghdad days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAustin, whose visit came just days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, said in a statement later that he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet Muhammad Abbasi.\n\nLoad Error\n\nAustin was greeted on touchdown in Baghdad by Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\n\"We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers [about 19,300 square miles] from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, using an Arabic name for Islamic State.\n\nAustin also said that U.S. forces were ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces were operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the \"Iraqi-led fight against terrorism.\"\n\n\"This is a critical mission, and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners,\" said Austin, one of the most senior Biden administration officials to visit Iraq in recent years.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed Hussein from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the last 20 years.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted upon arrival.\n\n\"We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region,\" Austin said.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, Islamis State militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. The group has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months.\n\nIn a related issue, the U.S. has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from Al Hol camp in northeast Syria, home to tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are women, wives and widows of Islamic State fighters.\n\nA separate, heavily guarded section of the camp known as the annex houses an additional 10,000 people -- including 2,000 women from 57 other countries, considered the most diehard Islamic State supporters, along with about 8,000 of their children.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from Al Hol over the last few weeks.\n\n\"Military action alone won't ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh,\" Austin added. \"So let me recognize the Iraqi government's ongoing repatriations of Iraqi citizens from northeast Syria.\"\n\nReading out a statement to reporters, Austin said all countries with citizens in the detention facilities and displaced persons camps in northeast Syria \"must take similar steps.\" He said the U.S. stood ready to continue supporting Iraq and all countries working to repatriate their citizens.\n\nAustin did not take questions.\n\n\"We are focused on the mission of defeating Daesh, and we are here for no other purpose. Any threats or attacks on our forces only undermine that mission,\" Austin said, apparently referring to Iran-backed fighters who were blamed for attacks on facilities housing U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nAustin said that he spoke with Iraqi leaders about the long-term vision \"for our defense partnership with Iraq, which will outlast Daesh.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD -- U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit Tuesday to the Iraqi capital where he vowed to continue the fight against the Islamic State group until the extremists are defeated.\n\nAustin, whose visit came just days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein, said in statement later that he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet Muhammad Al-Abbasi.\n\nAl-Sudani's office said he and Austin discussed cooperation between their countries in the fight against IS. The Iraqi premier reaffirmed his government's ''keenness to strengthen and consolidate relations with the United States of America at various levels and fields.''\n\nAustin was greeted on touchdown in Baghdad by Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\n''We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,'' Austin said, using an Arabic name for IS. ''The United State remains committed to this fight in support of Iraq's security and the security of the entire region.''\n\nAustin also said that U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces are operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the ''Iraqi-led fight against terrorism.''\n\n''This is a critical mission and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners,'' said Austin, one of the most senior Biden administration officials to visit Iraq in recent years.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed longtime dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\n''I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,'' Austin tweeted upon arrival.\n\n''We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region,'' Austin said, referring to Iraq's improving its relations with Arab countries.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months.\n\nIn a related issue, the U.S. has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, home to tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents in the fenced-in camp. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are women, wives and widows of IS fighters.\n\nA separate, heavily guarded section of the camp known as the annex houses an additional 10,000 people -- including 2,000 women from 57 other countries, considered the most die-hard IS supporters, along with about 8,000 of their children.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past few weeks.\n\n''Military action alone won't ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh,'' Austin added. ''So let me recognize the Iraqi government's ongoing repatriations of Iraqi citizens from northeast Syria.''\n\nReading from a statement to gathered reporters, Austin said all countries with citizens in the detention facilities and displaced persons camps in northeast Syria ''must take similar steps.'' He said the U.S. stands ready to continue supporting Iraq and all countries working to repatriate their citizens.\n\nThe U.S. defense secretary did not take questions.\n\n''We are focused on the mission of defeating Daesh, and we are here for no other purpose. Any threats or attacks on our forces only undermine that mission,'' Austin said, apparently referring to Iran-backed fighters who were blamed for attacks on facilities housing U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nAustin said that he spoke with Iraqi leaders about the long term vision ''for our defense partnership with Iraq, which will outlast Daesh.''",

                    "body": "Baghdad: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country\n\nThe 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin told reporters after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nSudani later said in a statement that his government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region\".\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating the Islamic State (ISIS), who seized swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nAustin's trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after U.S. forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani and will meet the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and the Kurdish government.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. U.S. and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS).",

                    "body": "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit Tuesday to the Iraqi capital where he vowed to continue the fight against the Islamic State group until the extremists are defeated.\n\nAustin, whose visit came just days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein, said in statement later that he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet Muhammad Al-Abbasi.\n\nAustin was greeted on touchdown in Baghdad by Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\n\"We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, using an Arabic name for IS.\n\nAustin also said that U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces are operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the \"Iraqi-led fight against terrorism.\"\n\n\"This is a critical mission and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners,\" said Austin, one of the most senior Biden administration officials to visit Iraq in recent years.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed longtime dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted upon arrival.\n\n\"We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region,\" Austin said, referring to Iraq's improving its relations with Arab countries.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months.\n\nIn a related issue, the U.S. has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, home to tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents in the fenced-in camp. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are women, wives and widows of IS fighters.\n\nA separate, heavily guarded section of the camp known as the annex houses an additional 10,000 people -- including 2,000 women from 57 other countries, considered the most die-hard IS supporters, along with about 8,000 of their children.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past few weeks.\n\n\"Military action alone won't ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh,\" Austin added. \"So let me recognize the Iraqi government's ongoing repatriations of Iraqi citizens from northeast Syria.\"\n\nReading from a statement to gathered reporters, Austin said all countries with citizens in the detention facilities and displaced persons camps in northeast Syria \"must take similar steps.\" He said the U.S. stands ready to continue supporting Iraq and all countries working to repatriate their citizens.\n\nThe U.S. defense secretary did not take questions.\n\n\"We are focused on the mission of defeating Daesh, and we are here for no other purpose. Any threats or attacks on our forces only undermine that mission,\" Austin said, apparently referring to Iran-backed fighters who were blamed for attacks on facilities housing U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nAustin said that he spoke with Iraqi leaders about the long term vision \"for our defense partnership with Iraq, which will outlast Daesh.\"",

                    "body": "Iraq has been a point of friction in tense US-Iran relations for the last 20 years\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit Tuesday to the Iraqi capital where he vowed to continue the fight against the Islamic State group until the terrorists are defeated.\n\nAustin, whose visit came two weeks before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein, said in statement later that he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet Muhammad Al-Abbasi.\n\nAustin was greeted on touchdown in Baghdad by Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\n'We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers (19,300 miles) from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,' Austin said, using an Arabic name for IS.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit Tuesday to the Iraqi capital where he vowed to continue the fight against the Islamic State group until the extremists are defeated. He is greeted by on the ground by Major General Matthew McFarlane\n\nIraq's Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani (right) meets with Austin in Baghdad, two weeks before the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion\n\nAustin also said that U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces are operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the 'Iraqi-led fight against terrorism.'\n\n'This is a critical mission and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners,' said Austin, one of the most senior Biden administration officials to visit Iraq in recent years.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed longtime dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\n'I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,' Austin tweeted upon arrival.\n\n'We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region,' Austin said, referring to Iraq's improving its relations with Arab countries.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months.\n\nIn a related issue, the U.S. has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, home to tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents in the fenced-in camp. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are women, wives and widows of IS fighters.\n\nA separate, heavily guarded section of the camp known as the annex houses an additional 10,000 people - including 2,000 women from 57 other countries, considered the most die-hard IS supporters, along with about 8,000 of their children.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past few weeks.\n\n'Military action alone won\u00b4t ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh,' Austin added. 'So let me recognize the Iraqi government\u00b4s ongoing repatriations of Iraqi citizens from northeast Syria.'\n\nReading from a statement to gathered reporters, Austin said all countries with citizens in the detention facilities and displaced persons camps in northeast Syria 'must take similar steps.' He said the U.S. stands ready to continue supporting Iraq and all countries working to repatriate their citizens.\n\nThe U.S. defense secretary did not take questions.\n\n'We are focused on the mission of defeating Daesh, and we are here for no other purpose. Any threats or attacks on our forces only undermine that mission,' Austin said, apparently referring to Iran-backed fighters who were blamed for attacks on facilities housing U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nAustin said that he spoke with Iraqi leaders about the long term vision 'for our defense partnership with Iraq, which will outlast Daesh.'\n\nAustin also said that U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces are operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the 'Iraqi-led fight against terrorism'\n\nA statue of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein is pulled down in central Baghdad on April 9, 2003, as his 24-year regime came to an end",

                    "body": "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III made an unannounced visit Tuesday to the Iraqi capital, where he vowed to continue the fight against Islamic State until the extremists are defeated.\n\nAustin, whose visit came just days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, said in a statement later that he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet Muhammad Abbasi.\n\nAustin was greeted on touchdown in Baghdad by Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\n\"We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers [about 19,300 square miles] from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, using an Arabic name for Islamic State.\n\nAustin also said that U.S. forces were ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces were operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the \"Iraqi-led fight against terrorism.\"\n\n\"This is a critical mission, and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners,\" said Austin, one of the most senior Biden administration officials to visit Iraq in recent years.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed Hussein from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the last 20 years.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted upon arrival.\n\n\"We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region,\" Austin said.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, Islamis State militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. The group has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months.\n\nIn a related issue, the U.S. has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from Al Hol camp in northeast Syria, home to tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are women, wives and widows of Islamic State fighters.\n\nA separate, heavily guarded section of the camp known as the annex houses an additional 10,000 people -- including 2,000 women from 57 other countries, considered the most diehard Islamic State supporters, along with about 8,000 of their children.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from Al Hol over the last few weeks.\n\n\"Military action alone won't ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh,\" Austin added. \"So let me recognize the Iraqi government's ongoing repatriations of Iraqi citizens from northeast Syria.\"\n\nReading out a statement to reporters, Austin said all countries with citizens in the detention facilities and displaced persons camps in northeast Syria \"must take similar steps.\" He said the U.S. stood ready to continue supporting Iraq and all countries working to repatriate their citizens.\n\n\"We are focused on the mission of defeating Daesh, and we are here for no other purpose. Any threats or attacks on our forces only undermine that mission,\" Austin said, apparently referring to Iran-backed fighters who were blamed for attacks on facilities housing U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nAustin said that he spoke with Iraqi leaders about the long-term vision \"for our defense partnership with Iraq, which will outlast Daesh.\"",

                    "body": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced trip to Baghdad on Tuesday, where he promised to continue to battle the Islamic State until the group is defeated.\n\nAustin's trip comes ahead of the 20th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, led by the United States, that ousted former leader Saddam Hussein.\n\n\"Wheels down in Baghdad. I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted, accompanying a video of him stepping off the plane and greeting Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq.\n\nDuring the visit, Austin met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet Muhammad Al-Abbasi, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIraq has served as a point of friction between the U.S. and Iran, with Tehran's influence in the region growing over the past two decades. Despite U.S. successes in ousting the group from territory it controlled six years ago, Islamic State fighters and sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in Syria and Iraq, killing or wounding dozens of Iraqi troops in recent months.\n\n\"We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, using an Arabic name for the Islamic State, according to the AP.",

He met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and is expected to meet other senior officials while he is in the country.\n\nLLOYD AUSTIN EMBARKS ON TRIP TO MIDDLE EAST TO REASSURE ALLIES\n\nThe secretary said in a statement he's in Iraq to \"reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" according to the press pool.\n\nAustin's visit comes weeks ahead of the 20-year anniversary of the U.S.'s invasion of Iraq in March 2003, which ultimately resulted in both the toppling of Saddam Hussein and the deaths of 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nThe defense secretary, who was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion, is in the middle of a trip that includes stops in Jordan, Egypt and Israel.\n\nHis trip is designed to reaffirm to U.S. allies in the Middle East that the U.S. \"remains committed to supporting their defense and increasing and strengthening the strategic partnerships with each of these countries,\" a senior Pentagon official told reporters on Friday, ahead of his departure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe topic of Iran's ongoing maligned behavior is also a top issue for Austin to discuss with regional partners.\n\n\"He will obviously be speaking about the unprovoked war of choice by Russia and Ukraine,\" the official added. \"He will share his views about the imperative of increasing support to Ukraine now. He will also talk about the strategic implications of increasing Russian-Iranian military cooperation, which right now is killing Ukrainians but, eventually, will come back with significant and negative security consequences for the Middle East.\"",

The vast majority of them are Iraqis and Syrians.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al Hol over the past weeks.",

Austin in turn wrote on Twitter upon arrival: \"I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq.\"\n\n\"Secretary Austin shared his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilizing activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nIn just two weeks the country will mark 20 years of the ground invasion that ousted Saddam Hussain's regime and plunged the country into years of bloodshed. While successive governments established close ties with Iran, current leadership tries to maintain good relations with Washington in a delicate balancing act.\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighboring Jordan with King Abdullah II and shortly before his trip to Israel where he is expected to discuss the Iranian threat with the country's leadership.",

                    "body": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit on Tuesday, March 7, to the Iraqi capital where he vowed to continue the fight against the Islamic State group until the extremists are defeated.\n\nAustin, whose visit came just days before the 20 anniversary of the US-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein, said in statement later that he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Defense Minister Thabet Muhammad Al-Abbasi.\n\nAustin was greeted on touchdown in Baghdad by Major General Matthew McFarlane, the US commander in Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\n\"We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, using an Arabic name for IS.\n\nAustin also said that US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces are operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the \"Iraqi-led fight against terrorism.\"\n\n\"This is a critical mission and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners,\" said Austin, one of the most senior Biden administration officials to visit Iraq in recent years.\n\nSince the US-led invasion in 2003 that removed longtime dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted upon arrival.\n\n\"We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region,\" Austin said, referring to Iraq's improving its relations with Arab countries.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months. In a related issue, the US has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, home to tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents in the fenced-in camp. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are women, wives and widows of IS fighters.\n\nA separate, heavily guarded section of the camp known as the annex houses an additional 10,000 people - including 2,000 women from 57 other countries, considered the most die-hard IS supporters, along with about 8,000 of their children. Iraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past few weeks.\n\n\"Military action alone won't ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh,\" Austin added. \"So let me recognize the Iraqi government's ongoing repatriations of Iraqi citizens from northeast Syria.\"\n\nReading from a statement to gathered reporters, Austin said all countries with citizens in the detention facilities and displaced persons camps in northeast Syria \"must take similar steps.\" He said the US stands ready to continue supporting Iraq and all countries working to repatriate their citizens.",

                    "body": "Lloyd Austin arrived in Baghdad on unannounced visit\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin landed in Baghdad on Tuesday on an unannounced visit to Iraq. He became the highest-ranking cabinet member from the Biden administration to have ever visited the country.\n\nThe defense secretary tweeted that his trip is meant to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership and lead to a more \"secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq.\" According to Reuters, Austin's visit was kept a secret until he landed due to security concerns. The secretary is currently on a multi-nation tour of the region.\n\nAustin's visit comes just two weeks ahead of the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq that ousted the country's leader Saddam Hussein and led to two decades of brutal fighting. The 2003 invasion led to the death of between 180,000 to 210,000 civilians, according to the Iraq Body Count project, while the instability caused by the toppling of the Iraqi government and the withdrawal of US forces in 2011 ultimately led to the rise of Islamic State, ISIS and ISIL.\n\nUS troops returned to the country in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government to combat ISIS. However, after the terrorist group was mostly suppressed, the US decided to keep 2,500 of its troops stationed in Iraq and 900 in Syria.\n\nThat's despite the Iraqi parliament voting to expel all foreign troops after the US assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. Then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted at the time that the Iraqi people wanted the US to remain on their soil, and that Washington \"will continue to do all the things we need to do to keep America safe.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, citing an anonymous US Defense official, Austin is expected to tell the Iraqi government during his visit that the US remains committed to retain its forces' presence in the country. \"But it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" he said.\n\nPrior to his trip to Baghdad, Austin also met with Jordan's King Abdullah ll in that country's capital, Amman. There he warned of \"unthinkable\" military ties developing between Russia and Iran, and reassured regional allies that Washington remains committed to the Middle East \"for the long haul.\"\n\nThe defense secretary is also expected to visit US allies Egypt and Israel, where he also plans to raise Washington's concerns over Iran's ties with Russia, as well as China's growing interest in the region.",

Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. U.S. and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali in Baghdad, additional reporting by Amina Ismail in Erbil; Editing by Andrew Heavens, Angus MacSwan and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

Austin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country The 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion. \"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin told reporters after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty,\" he said. Sudani later said in a statement that his government's approach is to maintain balanced relations with regional and international governments based on shared interests and respect for sovereignty, and that \"the stability of Iraq is the key to the security and stability of the region\".\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries. Islamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nSYMBOLISM Austin's trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after U.S. forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike. \"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani and will meet the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government. Former President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. U.S. and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University. Austin, a former head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit Tuesday to the Iraqi capital where he vowed to continue the fight against the Islamic State group until the extremists are defeated.\n\nAustin, whose visit came just days before the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein, said in statement later that he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Defence Minister Thabet Muhammad Al-Abbasi.\n\nAustin was greeted on touchdown in Baghdad by Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the US commander in Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\n\"We'll continue working to accomplish this mission together. Through the global coalition to defeat Daesh, we liberated more than 50,000 square kilometers from Daesh and freed more than 4.5 million Iraqis from their cruel grip,\" Austin said, using an Arabic name for IS.\n\nAustin also said that US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of its government, adding that these forces are operating in a non-combat and advisory role in support of the \"Iraqi-led fight against terrorism.\" \"This is a critical mission and we're proud to support our Iraqi partners,\" said Austin, one of the most senior Biden administration officials to visit Iraq in recent years.\n\nSince the US-led invasion in 2003 that removed longtime dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted upon arrival.\n\n\"We continue to believe that Iraq's greater integration with its Arab partners in the region will deliver increased stability, security and prosperity, and it will pay dividends not only for Iraqi citizens, but for all people of the region,\" Austin said, referring to Iraq's improving its relations with Arab countries.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighbouring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months.\n\nIn a related issue, the US has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, home to tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents in the fenced-in camp. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are women, wives and widows of IS fighters.\n\nA separate, heavily guarded section of the camp known as the annex houses an additional 10,000 people -- including 2,000 women from 57 other countries, considered the most die-hard IS supporters, along with about 8,000 of their children.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past few weeks.\n\n\"Military action alone won't ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh,\" Austin added. \"So let me recognise the Iraqi government's ongoing repatriations of Iraqi citizens from northeast Syria.\" Reading from a statement to gathered reporters, Austin said all countries with citizens in the detention facilities and displaced persons camps in northeast Syria \"must take similar steps.\" He said the US stands ready to continue supporting Iraq and all countries working to repatriate their citizens.\n\nThe US defence secretary did not take questions.\n\n\"We are focused on the mission of defeating Daesh, and we are here for no other purpose. Any threats or attacks on our forces only undermine that mission,\" Austin said, apparently referring to Iran-backed fighters who were blamed for attacks on facilities housing US troops in Iraq.\n\nAustin said that he spoke with Iraqi leaders about the long term vision \"for our defence partnership with Iraq, which will outlast Daesh.''\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

He was the last commanding general of US forces in Iraq, which left in 2021.\n\nAustin said following a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani that \"US forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" and that the US \"will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty.\"\n\nAustin arrived in Iraq from Jordan, where he met with King Abdullah II. As part of the meeting they discussed \"a range of shared concerns, including security in nearby Iraq, the flow of illegal narcotics in the region, Syria, the escalating tensions in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and working toward a lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians,\" according to the US Defense Department.",

                    "body": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit to the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Tuesday, moving to bolster U.S. ties just days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein and triggered years of unrest as the country continues to fight against the extremist Islamic State group.\n\nAustin's visit comes days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. He is one of a number of foreign dignitaries -- including Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers and United Nations chief Antonio Guterres -- to visit Iraq ahead of the milestone. Former President George W. Bush justified the invasion with claims Iraqi dictator Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, though no such weapons were ever found. Hussein's regime was toppled and U.S. troops remained in the country for years until formally leaving in 2011, though it continued to maintain a military presence afterwards. The war triggered decades of unrest and killed between 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians, according to the Costs of War Project by Brown University researchers.\n\n2,500. That's how many troops the U.S. currently has stationed in Iraq, according to Reuters. The contingent, in addition to 900 stationed in neighboring Syria, are there to assist and advise local troops fighting the Islamic State. The Islamic State wreaked havoc across Iraq and Syria and seized vast swaths of territory from both countries in 2014. The group was ousted from Iraq in 2017 and ostensibly defeated in 2019, though sleeper cells and surviving elements pose an ongoing threat.\n\nIn Syria, Milley Says U.S. Troops Are Still Needed to Counter ISIS (NYT)",

                    "title": "State Department does Iraq a disservice with energy schemes",
                    "body": "When Biden administration officials like Brett McGurk, White House coordinator for the Middle East, and Amos Hochstein, special presidential coordinator for Global Infrastructure and Energy Security, pass through Iraqi Kurdistan, top on their agenda is encouraging Iraqi Kurds to sell oil to Turkey . The two senior officials, neither of whom has Senate confirmation, couch their entreaties in U.S. efforts to isolate Russia and Iran .\n\nKurds would be foolish to assume that the two have the full backing of the State Department , let alone the broader U.S. government. For too long, American officials have played in the Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish oil markets to their own benefit.\n\nPeter Galbraith, a Democratic activist, former diplomat, and National Defense University professor, leveraged his Kurdish contacts into oil contracts shortly after Operation Iraqi Freedom. Zalmay Khalilzad, a stalwart of Republican administrations, followed suit. Trump administration National Security Council Director Matthew Zais moved from the White House to become vice president of government affairs for HKN Energy, an outfit with extensive interests in Iraqi Kurdistan, although these may soon be ending.\n\nIt is impossible to know Hochstein's motives, but between the Obama and Biden administrations, he worked both for a Houston liquefied natural gas export company and on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas firm. Unlike many inside the administration, he is no stranger to the private sector.\n\nWhile it may be tempting for foreign officials to believe the word of senior American officials, it is important to differentiate between those confirmed and those unable to meet that standard. Kurdish oil is a tricky business. There are four problems with any policy purporting to encourage Kurdish oil sales through Turkey to Israel or other buyers.\n\nFirst, the Iraqi Supreme Court last year found against the Kurdistan Regional Government's oil and gas law. That was the basis for various Production Sharing Contracts with international oil firms. To encourage deliberate defiance of the Iraqi Supreme Court and government of Iraq has both legal and diplomatic ramifications. It is for this reason that the State Department's top Iraq officers are increasingly frustrated with Hochstein, who uses his energy mandate to run roughshod over sensitive policy.\n\nSecond, the International Court of Arbitration in Paris is prepared to side with Iraq against Turkey and Ankara's dealing in Kurdish oil. The judgment against Turkey for buying Kurdish oil might amount to more than $10 billion. The Iraqi and Turkish governments are engaged in last-minute diplomatic brinkmanship to reach a settlement that would put aside the decision. To encourage Kurdish defiance of Baghdad and dealing with Turkey threatens broader diplomacy.\n\nThird, the logic that trans-Turkey pipelines sideline Russia and Iran is nonsense. Azerbaijan, which ships oil across Turkey for export, openly participates in gas swaps with the Islamic Republic of Iran to make up for shortfalls. Turkey, meanwhile, has become money laundering central for the Kremlin.\n\nFinally, even if Hochstein had the State Department's buy-in for his scheme (and it is unclear he does), Congress does not approve of such empowerment of Turkey. Indeed, while Hochstein has sought to kill the EastMed pipeline in favor of TurkStream, many in Congress prefer to focus on future investment in Israeli, Cypriot, and Greek gas. Prominent congressmen and senators, including committee chairmen and ranking members, find any dealings which enrich and empower Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to be counter to U.S. regional interests.\n\nIt is bad when administrations do not speak with one voice. It is worse when freelancing undermines U.S. interests. The Biden administration needs to get its team under control. Iraqi Kurds, meanwhile, should be very careful as they move forward. Taking the advice of freelancing officials could lead them to a far broader fight with Congress and, down the road, perhaps even sanctions.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, making an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, said Washington was committed to keeping its military presence in the country\n\nThe 2003 invasion led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and created instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,\" Austin told reporters after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani.\n\n\"The United States will continue to strengthen and broaden our partnership in support of Iraqi security, stability, and sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nThe trip is also about supporting Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after U.S. forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAustin met Sudani as well as the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.\n\nSYMBOLISM\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. U.S. and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali in Baghdad; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Angus MacSwan)",

                    "body": "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin landed in Baghdad on Tuesday on an unannounced visit to Iraq. He became the highest-ranking cabinet member from the Biden administration to have ever visited the country.\n\nThe defense secretary tweeted that his trip is meant to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership and lead to a more \"secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq.\" According to Reuters, Austin's visit was kept a secret until he landed due to security concerns. The secretary is currently on a multi-nation tour of the region.\n\nAustin's visit comes just two weeks ahead of the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq that ousted the country's leader Saddam Hussein and led to two decades of brutal fighting. The 2003 invasion led to the death of between 180,000 to 210,000 civilians, according to the Iraq Body Count project, while the instability caused by the toppling of the Iraqi government and the withdrawal of US forces in 2011 ultimately led to the rise of Islamic State, ISIS and ISIL.\n\nUS troops returned to the country in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government to combat ISIS. However, after the terrorist group was mostly suppressed, the US decided to keep 2,500 of its troops stationed in Iraq and 900 in Syria.\n\nThat's despite the Iraqi parliament voting to expel all foreign troops after the US assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. Then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted at the time that the Iraqi people wanted the US to remain on their soil, and that Washington \"will continue to do all the things we need to do to keep America safe.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, citing an anonymous US Defense official, Austin is expected to tell the Iraqi government during his visit that the US remains committed to retain its forces' presence in the country. \"But it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" he said.\n\nPrior to his trip to Baghdad, Austin also met with Jordan's King Abdullah ll in that country's capital, Amman. There he warned of \"unthinkable\" military ties developing between Russia and Iran, and reassured regional allies that Washington remains committed to the Middle East \"for the long haul.\"\n\nThe defense secretary is also expected to visit US allies Egypt and Israel, where he also plans to raise Washington's concerns over Iran's ties with Russia, as well as China's growing interest in the region.",

Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq. The defense secretary is expected to meet top officials during his visit to Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed long time dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country , as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months. The United States has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, which holds tens of thousands of mostly women and children linked to IS. The vast majority of them are Iraqis and Syrians.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past weeks.",

The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin makes an unannounced trip to Baghdad\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nThe trip is also about supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after U.S. forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defense official said.\n\nAustin will meet Sudani as well as the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.\n\nSYMBOLISM\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. U.S. and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.\n\nRetired U.S. Marine Corp General Frank McKenzie, who headed American forces in the Middle East until last year, said Austin's trip showed Washington's commitment to the country after what he said were previous mistakes.\n\n\"It reflects a more mature U.S. approach to Iraq after the disastrous decision to withdraw late in the Obama administration, and that was a disastrous decision,\" McKenzie said.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali in Baghdad; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Angus MacSwan)\n\nRead more",

                    "body": "\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted as he landed in Baghdad.\n\nHis visit comes ahead of the March 20 anniversary of the ground invasion which ushered in two decades of bloodshed that Iraq is only now beginning to exit.\n\nIn the run-up, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers.\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, while Iraq also maintains relations with the United States, Iran's arch foe, in a delicate balancing act.\n\nBoth Washington and Tehran provided extensive support during Iraq's fightback against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, who overran swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nThe jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria.\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition troops at the end of 2021 but some units remain deployed to provide advice and training.\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region.\n\n\"Secretary Austin shared his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nDespite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq suffers from decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure and public services that have sparked repeated waves of protests.\n\nOctober 2021 elections were followed by a whole year of political vacuum before Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani was sworn in at the head of a government led by pro-Iran factions.\n\nThe political arm of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) paramilitary force, made up heavily of Tehran-trained groups, has long demanded the departure of all remaining coalition troops, although its calls have been less shrill since it entered government.\n\nUS ambassador Alina L. Romanowski holds regular talks with Iraqi officials and this week again hailed the \"strong\" relationship between the two countries.\n\nThere had been a sharp deterioration in ties under the Donald Trump administration after the then US president authorised the assassination of Iran's foreign operations chief General Qassem Soleimani along with his Iraqi lieutenant, Hashed number two Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020.",

                    "body": "Baghdad - US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Iraq on Tuesday on an unannounced visit barely two weeks before the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted as he landed in Baghdad.\n\nHis visit comes ahead of the March 20 anniversary of the ground invasion which ushered in two decades of bloodshed that Iraq is only now beginning to exit.\n\nIn the run-up, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers.\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, while Iraq also maintains relations with the United States, Iran's arch foe, in a delicate balancing act.\n\nBoth Washington and Tehran provided extensive support during Iraq's fightback against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, who overran swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nThe jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria.\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition troops at the end of 2021 but some units remain deployed to provide advice and training.\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region.\n\n\"Secretary Austin shared his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nDespite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq suffers from decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure and public services that have sparked repeated waves of protests.\n\nOctober 2021 elections were followed by a whole year of political vacuum before Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani was sworn in at the head of a government led by pro-Iran factions.\n\nThe political arm of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) paramilitary force, made up heavily of Tehran-trained groups, has long demanded the departure of all remaining coalition troops, although its calls have been less shrill since it entered government.\n\nUS ambassador Alina L. Romanowski holds regular talks with Iraqi officials and this week again hailed the \"strong\" relationship between the two countries.\n\nThere had been a sharp deterioration in ties under the Donald Trump administration after the then US president authorised the assassination of Iran's foreign operations chief General Qassem Soleimani along with his Iraqi lieutenant, Hashed number two Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020.",

(RAIGO PAJULA / AFP)\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Iraq on Tuesday on an unannounced visit barely two weeks before the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nAustin is slated to arrive in Israel on Wednesday for a two-day visit as part of an overall Mideast tour that also includes stops in Jordan and Egypt.\n\nDuring his meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah in Amman on Sunday, Austin \"discussed his concern regarding the escalation in tensions in the West Bank and Jerusalem,\" according to the US Defense Department. Austin also thanked Abdullah for hosting the recent Aqaba summit, \"which reaffirmed the necessity of de-escalating tensions.\"\n\nUpon his departure from Washington, a senior US defense official said that Austin intends to \"be quite frank with Israeli leaders about his concerns regarding the cycle of violence in the West Bank and consult on what steps Israeli leaders can take to meaningfully restore calm before the upcoming holidays,\" a reference to Ramadan and Passover next month.\n\nAustin and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke via phone two weeks ago, with the US defense secretary calling for taking steps to calm tensions and discussing \"joint efforts to calm the area ahead of the holidays.\"\n\nLanding in Baghdad on Tuesday, Austin tweeted: \"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq.\"\n\nHis visit comes ahead of the March 20 anniversary of the ground invasion which ushered in two decades of bloodshed that Iraq is only now beginning to exit. In the run-up, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers and UN chief Antonio Guterres.\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbor Iran, while Iraq maintains relations with Iran's arch foe the United States in a delicate balancing act.\n\nBoth allies provided extensive support during Iraq's fightback against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, who overran swaths of northern and western Iraq in 2014. The jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighboring Syria.\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition troops at the end of 2021 but some units remain deployed to provide advice and training.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD (AP) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit on Tuesday to the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, just days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein.\n\nAustin was greeted on touchdown in Baghdad by Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq. The defense secretary is expected to meet top officials during his visit to Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed longtime dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted upon his arrival.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months. The U.S. has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, which holds tens of thousands of mostly women and children linked to IS. The vast majority of them are Iraqis and Syrians.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past weeks.",

                    "body": "The murder of a young Iraqi YouTuber by her father has sparked renewed calls for a law to fight domestic violence in the conservative Arab country where so-called 'honour killings' remain rife.\n\nDozens of Iraqi protesters rallied nearby the Supreme Judicial Council in the capital Baghdad last month, days after 22-year-old blogger Tiba al-Ali was strangled to death by her father in the southern province of Diwaniyah.\n\nShe had been living in Turkey since 2017 and had a YouTube channel with over 20,000 subscribers posting videos of her everyday life with her Syrian-born fianc\u00e9.\n\n\"Nearly every day, we hear about a woman who's been murdered somewhere in Iraq\"\n\nHer father, who turned himself in to the police after the murder, was presumably unhappy about her move and her plans to marry her partner.\n\n\"When the news broke, we said 'oh no, not again,\" said Yanar Mohammed, the co-founder and director of the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), adding that her first reaction to the dramatic event was echoed by some colleagues of hers who are used to seeing news of killed women circulating on social media.\n\n\"Nearly every day, we hear about a woman who's been murdered somewhere in Iraq,\" OWFI's head continued. Only last year, the women's rights group was conducting a campaign focusing on the right to life.\n\nRights advocates in Baghdad condemned the killing, demanding legislative reforms to impose harsher punishments on perpetrators and to protect women from gender violence.\n\nFurther small demonstrations, rather under-reported, took place across different provinces, including in Diwaniyah.\n\nYanar, a prominent Iraqi feminist, said that a few days after the tragedy, a court in Diwaniyah ruled that Tiba's father had committed premeditated murder. She emphasised that such a ruling was possible thanks to the \"pressure\" exerted by rights groups and \"media coverage\" of the protest in the capital, taking into account that the victim was a well-known figure among Iraqis.\n\nThe United Nations in Iraq condemned the murder of the young woman, calling on the country's government to support laws and policies to prevent violence against women and girls and take all measures to address impunity.\n\nAmnesty International's Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa Aya Majzoub said in a statement that until Iraqi authorities adopt robust legislation to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, violence against women and girls in Iraq will continue.\n\n\"She also criticised a common practice adopted by community police in handling cases of domestic violence that solely involves going to the victim's house and getting the abuser to sign a pledge of good conduct, thus focusing on reconciliation rather than law enforcement\"\n\nThe interior ministry spokesman Saad Maan wrote on Twitter that Tiba had been on a visit to Iraq and that the day before her death, the local community police had tried to mediate a \"dispute\" between her and her family. Saad added that the police were \"surprised\" the next day by the news that she had been murdered by her father.\n\nThe YouTuber posted on Instagram about family threats against her on her arrival in Iraq, feeling her life was in danger. Her family reportedly took her by force from a friend's house in Baghdad to Diwaniyah governorate. The local police were aware of the threats days before her death.\n\n\"It's horrendous and shameless. The crime was definitely avoidable,\" Balsam Mustafa, a researcher focusing on cyberfeminism in Iraq and the MENA region, told The New Arab. \"They were well aware of what was happening, but they did nothing to stop it.\"\n\nThe Iraqi researcher stressed that not a day goes by without seeing a hashtag starting with haq (right in Arabic) followed by a female name indicating the alarming occurrence of crimes of domestic violence in Iraq.\n\nShe also criticised a common practice adopted by community police in handling cases of domestic violence that solely involves going to the victim's house and getting the abuser to sign a pledge of good conduct, thus focusing on reconciliation rather than law enforcement.\n\n\"The community police just said they had been to Tiba's family home on the eve of her killing and got her father to sign that he wouldn't harm her girl,\" Tamara Amer, the founder of Support Her Organization for Women's Rights, told The New Arab, clearly expressing her shock. \"For the police, it was enough, their job was done,\" she added in dismay.\n\nThe Iraqi NGO shared unverified voiced recordings that the blogger reportedly sent to friends the night before the infamous incident in which she confronted her mother and father about not returning to Iraq after her brother sexually assaulted her.\n\n\"One out of every five Iraqi women is subjected to violence by relatives\"\n\nThe killing of Tiba has drawn outrage in a country where violations and abuses against women and girls pervade society in various forms.\n\nCommenting on the reactions she came across on social media, Tamara encountered sympathy for Tiba, but also criticism over her personal life, attempts to smear her reputation, and victim blaming.\n\nShe also mentioned the fear that cruel crime triggered among violence survivors. \"Many girls saw their fate in what happened to Tiba,\" the Iraqi-Danish activist remarked, \"they're afraid they may get killed today, forgotten tomorrow and there will be no justice.\"\n\nThere has been increased reporting of incidents of domestic and gender-based violence in Iraq. Though official figures about the scale of the problem are hard to obtain, it is believed that thousands of women suffer from domestic violence and dozens are victims of honour killings every year.\n\nIn 2020, the High Commission for Human Rights in Iraq documented around 15,000 domestic violence cases. One out of every five Iraqi women is subjected to violence by relatives, according to some official statistics.\n\nVictims of domestic or gender violence have nowhere to report the crime or they are reluctant to do so because of these laws. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) found that 75 percent of Iraqi women would not report such crimes for fear of more violence, and 85 percent of Iraqi men would stop female family members from filing a complaint.\n\nMoreover, women complainants are often temporarily housed in female prisons due to a lack of shelters or reception facilities.\n\nThe extreme action against yet another Iraqi woman has revived calls for the enactment of legislation against gender-based violence as no law in the country criminalises domestic violence.\n\nA draft domestic violence law, which was introduced to the Iraqi parliament in 2014, has been stalled for years due to the strong conservative beliefs held by a majority of the MPs.\n\nWorse, the country's penal code enables violence against women by allowing men to \"discipline\" their wives or female relatives, including beatings, and reducing sentences to a maximum of three years for violent acts such as assault and murder when committed out of \"honour\" (Articles 41 and 409).\n\nOWFI, alongside other local women's rights groups, has been advocating for the repeal of Articles 41 and 409. Talking over her organisation's persistent efforts, the feminist director referred to two lawsuits they filed last year against those legislators who refuse to lift what she described as \"criminal articles.\"\n\nAt their first attempt, in March, the Iraqi federal court rejected the legal action with an unsubstantiated response while the second time, in the summer, the court did not even respond.\n\n\"We will keep putting MPs and the federal court under pressure to see those provisions revoked,\" Yanar vowed.\n\nTamara slammed the patriarchal, misogynist views among members of the Iraqi parliament highlighting how the well-being of women is not a priority for them.\n\nSome civil society activists push for the enactment of the anti-domestic violence bill in the face of opposition from Islamist parties and clerics who believe it would split families. Others seek to amend it by defining the different forms of domestic violence and binding the government to open domestic violence shelters.\n\n\"Some civil society activists push for the enactment of the anti-domestic violence bill in the face of opposition from Islamist parties and clerics who believe it would split families\"\n\nBalsam noted that at least two or three versions of the draft law have been put forward since 2010, and all of them have several gaps and shortcomings. \"The latest draft also has various flaws, especially in that it doesn't clearly define what domestic violence is or specify the types of violence,\" she said critically, \"Iraq needs a robust law to start with.\"\n\nIraqi activists point out that legislation alone is not enough to combat the phenomenon. Strengthening state institutions, and shifting cultural attitudes at an institutional and societal level are needed to address the issue.\n\nMore needs to be done to protect women and girls at risk of domestic abuse. OWFI is the only group running women's shelters in Iraq, helping more than 1,300 escape domestic violence, death threats and exploitation for the past 20 years.\n\nUntil today, it continues to provide crucial safety and support to domestic violence survivors, despite serious legal and security risks.\n\nThe feminist organisation has faced intimidation and attacks, with staff recently chased by police at night time and arrest warrants issued against them containing fabricated accusations.\n\nThree years ago, the Iraqi government launched a lawsuit to dissolve the association, which appeared to be politically motivated, though the judge dismissed all claims against OWFI.",

                    "body": "US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin embraces Major General Matthew McFarlane, during his unannounced trip to Baghdad, Iraq, March 7, 2023. (Reuters)\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday in a visit aimed at showing that Washington was committed to keeping its military presence there nearly 20 years after the March 19, 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and wreaked havoc on Iraq.\n\nThe 2003 invasion killed tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and led to instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State (ISIS) extremist group after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of US forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin said.\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating ISIS, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\n\"What (Iraqis) will hear from him is commitment to retaining our force presence, but it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" a senior US defence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nISIS is far from the formidable force it once was, but extremistcells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nThe trip is also about supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shiaa al-Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after US forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defence official said.\n\nAustin will meet Sudani as well as the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.\n\n\"More mature US\"\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. US and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all US forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against the \"Islamic State\".\n\nRetired US Marine Corp General Frank McKenzie, who headed American forces in the Middle East until last year, said Austin's trip showed Washington's commitment to the country after what he said were previous mistakes.\n\n\"It reflects a more mature US approach to Iraq after the disastrous decision to withdraw late in the Obama administration, and that was a disastrous decision,\" McKenzie said.",

The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" the senior US defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nAustin was the last commanding general of US forces in Iraq after the 2003 invasion.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe defense secretary is slated to visit Egypt and Israel amid heightened tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.",

                    "body": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Iraq on Tuesday on an unannounced visit barely two weeks before the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted as he landed in Baghdad.\n\nHis visit comes ahead of the March 20 anniversary of the ground invasion which ushered in two decades of bloodshed that Iraq is only now beginning to exit.\n\nIn the run-up, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers.\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, while Iraq also maintains relations with the United States, Iran's arch foe, in a delicate balancing act.\n\nBoth Washington and Tehran provided extensive support during Iraq's fightback against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, who overran swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nThe jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria.\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition troops at the end of 2021 but some units remain deployed to provide advice and training.\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region.\n\n\"Secretary Austin shared his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nDespite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq suffers from decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure and public services that have sparked repeated waves of protests.\n\nOctober 2021 elections were followed by a whole year of political vacuum before Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani was sworn in at the head of a government led by pro-Iran factions.\n\nThe political arm of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) paramilitary force, made up heavily of Tehran-trained groups, has long demanded the departure of all remaining coalition troops, although its calls have been less shrill since it entered government.\n\nUS ambassador Alina L. Romanowski holds regular talks with Iraqi officials and this week again hailed the \"strong\" relationship between the two countries.\n\nThere had been a sharp deterioration in ties under the Donald Trump administration after the then US president authorised the assassination of Iran's foreign operations chief General Qassem Soleimani along with his Iraqi lieutenant, Hashed number two Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020.",

The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" a senior US defence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.",

                    "body": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Iraq on Tuesday on an unannounced visit barely two weeks before the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted as he landed in Baghdad.\n\nHis visit comes ahead of the March 20 anniversary of the ground invasion which ushered in two decades of bloodshed that Iraq is only now beginning to exit.\n\nIn the run-up, Iraq has hosted a raft of foreign officials, including UN chief Antonio Guterres and the Iranian, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers.\n\nSince US-led coalition troops ousted Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime, Iraq's Shiite majority has led Iraq under a confessional power-sharing system.\n\nSuccessive governments have forged close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led neighbour Iran, while Iraq also maintains relations with the United States, Iran's arch foe, in a delicate balancing act.\n\nBoth Washington and Tehran provided extensive support during Iraq's fightback against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, who overran swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nThe jihadists were ousted from Iraqi territory in 2017 but retain sleeper cells in desert and mountain hideouts in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria.\n\nIraq announced the end of combat operations by US-led coalition troops at the end of 2021 but some units remain deployed to provide advice and training.\n\nAustin's visit comes after he held talks in neighbouring Jordan with King Abdullah II, a staunch US ally in the region.\n\n\"Secretary Austin shared his concerns on a range of shared challenges, including... maintaining focus on security and stability in Iraq, and countering other destabilising activities in the region,\" a Pentagon statement said.\n\nDespite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq suffers from decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure and public services that have sparked repeated waves of protests.\n\nOctober 2021 elections were followed by a whole year of political vacuum before Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani was sworn in at the head of a government led by pro-Iran factions.\n\nThe political arm of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) paramilitary force, made up heavily of Tehran-trained groups, has long demanded the departure of all remaining coalition troops, although its calls have been less shrill since it entered government.\n\nUS ambassador Alina L. Romanowski holds regular talks with Iraqi officials and this week again hailed the \"strong\" relationship between the two countries.\n\nThere had been a sharp deterioration in ties under the Donald Trump administration after the then US president authorised the assassination of Iran's foreign operations chief General Qassem Soleimani along with his Iraqi lieutenant, Hashed number two Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020.",

                    "body": "\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin tweeted as he landed in Baghdad.\n\nThe defense secretary is expected to meet top officials during his visit to Iraq, which is home to about 2,000 of American troops. NATO has also several hundred troops there.\n\nIraq has endured nearly two decades of turmoil since a US-led coalition invaded Iraq in 2003.\n\nThe IS group seized roughly one third of Iraq and declared a \"caliphate\" in 2014, before its defeat more than three years later.\n\nDespite their defeat, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country, as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months.\n\nThe United States has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, which holds tens of thousands of mostly women and children linked to IS. The vast majority of them are Iraqis and Syrians.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past weeks.\n\nIraq has been caught for years in a delicate balancing act between its two main allies, the United States and Iran, and Baghdad only recently arrived at a fragile compromise government after a year of political stalemate.\n\nMonths earlier, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani defended the open-ended presence of US and other foreign troops in his country, in an interview to The Wall Street Journal, published on January 15.\n\nIn February, Iran's top diplomat Hossein Amir-Abdollahian held talks with neighbouring ally Iraq to ease regional tensions and discuss security along their shared border.\n\nOn several occasions, Sudani expressed his country's desire to have good relations with both the United States and Iran.\n\n\"We strive for that,\" he added. \"I don't see this as an impossible matter, to see Iraq have a good relationship with Iran and the US.\"",

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who pledged \"deep solidarity with the Iraqi people and my hope that Iraq will face a future of peace and prosperity and with consolidated democratic institutions.\"",

Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the US commander in Iraq. The defence secretary is expected to meet top officials during his visit to Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\nSince the US-led invasion in 2003 that removed long time dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country , as well as in neighbouring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months. The United States has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, which holds tens of thousands of mostly women and children linked to IS. The vast majority of them are Iraqis and Syrians.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past weeks.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD, Afghanistan - US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday, March 7, in a visit aimed at showing that Washington was committed to keeping its military presence there nearly 20 years after the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe 2003 invasion killed tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and led to instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of US forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin said.\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\n\"What (Iraqis) will hear from him is commitment to retaining our force presence, but it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" a senior US defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nThe trip is also about supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after US forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defense official said.\n\nAustin will meet Sudani as well as the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. US and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist.\n\nBetween 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all US forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq.\n\nBut under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.\n\nRetired US Marine Corp General Frank McKenzie, who headed American forces in the Middle East until last year, said Austin's trip showed Washington's commitment to the country after what he said were previous mistakes.\n\n\"It reflects a more mature US approach to Iraq after the disastrous decision to withdraw late in the Obama administration, and that was a disastrous decision,\" McKenzie said. - Rappler.com",

Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq. The defense secretary is expected to meet top officials during his visit to Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed long time dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country , as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months. The United States has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, which holds tens of thousands of mostly women and children linked to IS. The vast majority of them are Iraqis and Syrians.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past weeks.\n\nSubscribe Get Unlimited Access $3 for 3 Months Subscribe Now\n\nSupport local journalism reporting on your community\n\n* New Subscribers Only\n\n* Digital Subscription Only\n\nAfter the initial selected subscription period your subscription rate will auto renew at $12.00 per month.",

Gen. Matthew McFarlane, the U.S. commander in Iraq. The defense secretary is expected to meet top officials during his visit to Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed long time dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country , as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months. The United States has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, which holds tens of thousands of mostly women and children linked to IS. The vast majority of them are Iraqis and Syrians.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past weeks.",

The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" the official told reporters.\n\nAustin is the most senior official in the Biden administration to visit Iraq. He was the last commanding general of U.S. forces in the country after the invasion.\n\nIRAN REISSUES THREAT TO 'KILL TRUMP, POMPEO' FOR SOLEIMANI DEATH WHEN ANNOUNCING LONG-RANGE CRUISE MISSILE\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin said on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. has 2,500 troops in Iraq and another 900 in Syria to support local troops in combating Islamic State militants who had seized large portions of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\nThe trip was also made to support Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani's efforts against Iranian influence in the country.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets in the past.\n\nThe U.S. and Iran neared a full-blown conflict in 2020 after the U.S. killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards' top commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defense official said.\n\n'WOKE' DEFENSE DEPARTMENT DEI EDUCATION OFFICIAL'S BOOKS NOW IN ONE THIRD OF PENTAGON SCHOOLS: GOV'T WATCHDOG\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAustin will meet Sudani and President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and the Kurdish government.",

Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country , as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months. The United States has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, which holds tens of thousands of mostly women and children linked to IS. The vast majority of them are Iraqis and Syrians.",

The defense secretary is expected to meet top officials during his visit to Iraq, which is home to hundreds of American troops helping in the fight against the militant Islamic State group.\n\nSince the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that removed long time dictator Saddam from power, Iraq has been a point of friction between the United States and Iran. Tehran has widely expanded its influence in Iraq over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite their defeat in Iraq in 2017, IS militants and their sleeper cells are still launching attacks in the country , as well as in neighboring Syria. IS has killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi troops over the past months. The United States has been urging countries around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, which holds tens of thousands of mostly women and children linked to IS. The vast majority of them are Iraqis and Syrians.\n\nIraq has repatriated more than 500 women and children from al-Hol over the past weeks.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD - US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday in a visit an official said was aimed at showing that Washington was committed to keeping its military presence there nearly 20 years after the US-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe 2003 invasion killed tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and led to instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of US forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin said.\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State militants, who had seized large swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\n\"What (Iraqis) will hear from him is commitment to retaining our force presence, but it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" the senior US defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells often operating independently have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nThe trip is just as much about supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after Iran's Revolutionary Guards' top commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defense official added.\n\nAustin will meet Sudani as well as President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.",

The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" the senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells often operating independently have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nThe trip is just as much about supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after Iran's Revolutionary Guards' top commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defense official added.\n\nAustin will meet Sudani as well as President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.",

                    "body": "But under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State. Retired U.S. Marine Corp General Frank McKenzie, who headed American forces in the Middle East until last year, said Austin's trip showed Washington's commitment to the country after what he said were previous mistakes.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday in a visit aimed at showing that Washington was committed to keeping its military presence there nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. The 2003 invasion killed tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and led to instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion. \"I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin said.\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries. \"What (Iraqis) will hear from him is commitment to retaining our force presence, but it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria. The trip is also about supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country, former officials and experts said.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after U.S. forces killed Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike. \"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defense official said.\n\nAustin will meet Sudani as well as the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government. SYMBOLISM\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration cited its belief that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government held weapons of mass destruction to justify the decision to invade Iraq. U.S. and allied forces later found that such stockpiles did not exist. Between 185,000 and 208,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University.\n\nAustin, a former head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said in 2011 that the United States had achieved its military objectives in Iraq. But under former President Barack Obama, the United States sent thousands of troops back into Iraq and Syria three years later to bolster the fight against Islamic State.\n\nRetired U.S. Marine Corp General Frank McKenzie, who headed American forces in the Middle East until last year, said Austin's trip showed Washington's commitment to the country after what he said were previous mistakes. \"It reflects a more mature U.S. approach to Iraq after the disastrous decision to withdraw late in the Obama administration, and that was a disastrous decision,\" McKenzie said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD: US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday in a visit an official said was aimed at showing that Washington was committed to keeping its military presence there nearly 20 years after the US-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe 2003 invasion killed tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and led to instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State (Daesh) militants after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of US forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin said.\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Daesh militants, who had seized large swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\nAlso read Rumsfeld: The man who destroyed Iraq twice, and lied about it Iraq exhibits restored art pillaged after 2003 invasion Iraq pays last instalment of war reparations to Kuwait totaling $52.4bn\n\n\"What (Iraqis) will hear from him is commitment to retaining our force presence, but it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" the senior US defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nDaesh is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells often operating independently have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nThe trip is just as much about supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Al Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets.\n\nThe United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after Iran's Revolutionary Guards' top commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defense official added.\n\nAustin will meet Sudani as well as President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.",

                    "body": "The Pentagon chief arrived in Baghdad on Tuesday morning after meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah on Monday, discussing regional security and violence in the occupied West Bank.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nIt comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq.\n\nMr Austin was the last commanding general of US forces in Iraq after the 2003 invasion and oversaw the withdrawal of troops between 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe visit will show Washington's commitment to retaining forces in the country, an official from the defence department said.\n\n\"What Iraqis will hear from him is commitment to retaining our force presence, but it's not just about the military instrument. The US is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" Reuters cited the anonymous official as saying.\n\nUS troops returned to Iraq in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government, leading the global coalition to defeat ISIS.\n\nTheir presence is controversial and has been met with fierce opposition from Iran-backed groups in Iraq, who often target military bases hosting US troops.\n\nIraq's parliament voted to expel foreign troops following the US assassination of Qassem Suleimani, commander of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) Quds Force and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Al Muhandis at Baghdad airport in January 2020.\n\nCommanders in the semi-autonomous Kurdish north have said US troops must remain to prevent an ISIS resurgence.\n\nMr Austin had made no mention of visiting Iraq when departing for his Middle East tour last week.\n\nHe is scheduled to visit Egypt and Israel amid heightened tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD: US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday in a visit an official said was aimed at showing that Washington was committed to keeping its military presence there nearly 20 years after the US-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe 2003 invasion killed tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and led to instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Daesh militants after the US withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of US forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the US-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin said.\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq -- and an additional 900 in Syria -- to help advise and assist local troops in combating Daesh militants, who had seized large swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\n\"What (Iraqis) will hear from him is commitment to retaining our force presence, but it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" the senior US defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells often operating independently have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nThe trip is just as much about supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Al-Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted US forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after Iran's Revolutionary Guards' top commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defense official added.\n\nAustin will meet Sudani as well as President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced trip to Iraq on Tuesday in a visit an official said was aimed at showing that Washington was committed to keeping its military presence there nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe 2003 invasion killed tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and led to instability that eventually paved the way for the rise of Islamic State militants after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2011.\n\nAustin, the most senior official in President Joe Biden's administration to visit Iraq, was the last commanding general of U.S. forces there after the invasion.\n\n\"I'm here to reaffirm the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership as we move toward a more secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,\" Austin said.\n\nThe United States currently has 2,500 troops in Iraq - and an additional 900 in Syria - to help advise and assist local troops in combating Islamic State militants, who had seized large swathes of territory in 2014 in both countries.\n\n\"What (Iraqis) will hear from him is commitment to retaining our force presence, but it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,\" the senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nIslamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells often operating independently have survived across parts of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria.\n\nThe trip is just as much about supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani's push back against Iranian influence in the country.\n\nIranian-backed militia in Iraq have occasionally targeted U.S. forces and its embassy in Baghdad with rockets. The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after Iran's Revolutionary Guards' top commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a drone strike.\n\n\"I think that Iraqi leaders share our interest in Iraq not becoming a playground for conflict between the United States and Iran,\" the defense official added.\n\nAustin will meet Sudani as well as President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani, amid a long-running dispute over budget transfers and oil revenue sharing between the national government and Kurdish government.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali in Baghdad; Editing by Andrew Heavens)",

                    "body": "It's a rare forum these days that can bring together senior figures from the US, Russia, Turkey, the Iraqi federal government, including groups close to Iran, and the two main parties from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.\n\nThe Erbil Forum last week did that, but it also illustrated just how hard it will be to find common ground between all parties involved -- and that is before throwing China into the mix.\n\nThere was a general feeling that, amid the war in Ukraine and the strategic competition with Beijing, Washington had lost interest in Iraq.\n\nYet the country remains pivotal to global energy. The second-largest oil producer within Opec, Iraq has room to grow output substantially and is a critical part of replacing any losses from Russia, if and when the group decides to open the taps. The Iraqi Kurdistan region's gas resources could power the rest of Iraq and export to Turkey, providing Europe with a partial alternative to Moscow.\n\nIt is the fourth-largest Arab country both by population and greenhouse gas emissions. Its people languish in heat and darkness, while its renewable energy potential remains virtually untouched.\n\nThe geopolitical games are multilayered. Iraqi affairs have gradually improved since the darkest days of the civil war in 2006-2007 and the onslaught of ISIS in 2014.\n\nBut the country now risks being drawn into conflicts not of its making, involving two regional players, Iran and Turkey, and three outside powers, the US, Russia and China.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the federal government finally concluded six petroleum contracts waiting for signature since the fifth bid round in 2018.\n\nThree were with Sharjah-based Crescent Petroleum, which already operates Iraqi Kurdistan's largest gasfield, Khor Mor, in partnership with Abu Dhabi-listed Dana Gas and three European companies.\n\nThe gas production from these blocks could be crucial in improving electricity supply and in supplementing Iraq's costly and unreliable imports from Iran.\n\nThis was doubly interesting.\n\nFirstly, rocket attacks on Khor Mor in recent months were interpreted as warnings to Kurdish parties to fall in line with Tehran's plans for the new government in Baghdad, but since they occurred again after government formation, they may also be seen as a threat not to pursue independent gas exports in competition with Iran in Iraq and Turkey.\n\nSecondly, the Federal Ministry of Oil had warned companies not to operate in the Iraqi Kurdistan region, after a February 2022 supreme court ruling that its oil and gas law was unconstitutional. The judgement was seen as politicised, but still has been enough to scare off several leading oil service companies and possibly to discourage traders from renewing arrangements to purchase Kurdish oil.\n\nNevertheless, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al Sudani showed himself ready to sign with one of the most prominent operators in the semi-autonomous region.\n\nA long-running arbitration wending its way through a Paris-based tribunal is expected soon to find in favour of Baghdad versus Ankara in declaring that Turkey breached a treaty when it allowed the Kurds to send oil through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline. Ankara won't pay up the mooted multiple billions of dollars in damages, but whatever compromise is reached could also cast aside Kurdish interests.\n\nThree of the other new field development contracts went to Chinese companies. They have become increasingly dominant in Iraq as others have packed their bags. If ExxonMobil leaves the West Qurna-1 field in favour of a Chinese partner, as is widely expected, China would operate more than half of Iraqi oil output. Chinese credit lines help underpin lending to Iraqi infrastructure, and Baghdad recently announced it was open to conducting some trade in yuan.\n\nRussian corporations -- Rosneft, Gazprom Neft and Lukoil -- also have a strong position. Rosneft paid and loaned up to $3 billion to the Iraqi Kurdistan region for oil sales, fields and pipelines just ahead of Erbil's referendum on independence in September 2017. They are unlikely to expand their position, though, given the difficulties of access to finance, banking and technology imposed by the Western sanctions.\n\nThe Iraqis themselves are aware of the danger of over-dependence on Beijing, but their investment-unfriendly policies block off alternatives. Recently, France's TotalEnergies reportedly nearly walked away from a multibillion package to develop oil, gas, water injection and solar power.\n\nA last-minute change of heart in Baghdad has brought them back to the negotiating table. However, there is not a great appetite from the other major international oil companies to do more, given their decarbonisation trajectories and the spread of opportunities elsewhere.\n\nIraq could manage external powers better if its own house were in order. But a federal law that would resolve management of the Kurdish petroleum sector, how oil should be sold and the revenues divided, appears out of reach. Despite talk of progress, the outline sounds like several previous deals that fell apart almost as soon as concluded.\n\nThe Kurdish position, meanwhile, is weakening, because of the widening split between the two main parties and even within the smaller of them, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The colourful Bafel Talabani, leader of the PUK, appeared at the forum wearing his trademark mountain boots and, at the conclusion of his interview, theatrically tore off his tie, reportedly borrowed from his urbane brother Qubad.\n\nHe has previously said that gas exports to Turkey, from fields located in PUK-controlled areas, would take place over his \"dead body\" if the people's interest were not fairly consulted.\n\nBut with oil resources running down, major gas projects are the main hope for new revenues and political importance.\n\nIraq thus illustrates in microcosm the dilemmas that many smaller and fragile states will encounter as Sino-Russo-American relations become increasingly uncompromising.\n\nStronger non-aligned countries can cleverly play off one great power against another. Weaker ones can easily be torn apart -- bad news not just for their people, but for global energy security.",

                    "body": "Iraq's financial crisis has worsened and compelled it to repay its debts to Iran in Iraqi dinars, Iraqi officials told Middle East Eye.\n\nThe country's currency has been struggling for months against the dollar since the US Federal Reserve imposed restrictions on how its central bank trades dollars received from oil sales.\n\nThe subsequent liquidity crisis has meant the government is failing to pay the salaries of millions of public servants, as well as pensions and payments to other beneficiaries of social welfare programs.\n\nIraq has been one of the largest importers of Iranian goods over the past two decades, particularly gas, electricity, food and construction materials.\n\nOfficial trade exchange between the countries amounts to approximately $14 billion. Because of US sanctions imposed on Iran in 2018, Iraq has struggled to pay Iran for its purchases since the fiscal 2019-20.\n\nAt times, Iran has cut electricity and gas supplies in midsummer - when temperatures rise to 50 degrees Celsius - to pressure Iraq into paying these debts.\n\nBaghdad accrued a debt of over $1.6 billion for its Iranian gas and energy purchases alone during 2019-21.\n\nSources suggest most or all of that debt has been settled, with the last payment going through in October 2022.\n\nBut rather than the dollars Iran received pre-sanctions, Baghdad has used Iraqi dinars instead, officials told MEE.\n\nThe new payment system was worked out to avoid the anti-government protests that would have inevitably followed a cut in energy supplies in Iraq, they said.\n\nYet Iran was able to turn these dinars into dollars - which are far more useful - using a currency auction the Central Bank of Iraq holds daily to convert the dollars it receives from oil sales.\n\nBut since November, the US Federal Reserve, which holds the money Iraq makes from oil sales and delivers it to Baghdad by request, has imposed restrictions aimed at stopping Iran from accessing these dollars.\n\nAs MEE previously revealed, this led to parties, including sanctioned states, to find new ways to obtain dollars, such as the black market and dollar smuggling through Kurdistan.\n\nAnd with Iran and others now avoiding changing dinars through the auction, Iraq has been unable to trade its dollars for the local currency it requires to meet its needs.\n\nAll this continues to place pressure on the dinar.\n\nIn January, its black market price rose to 1,700 to the dollar from 1,480 in October.\n\nTraders have described the fluctuations as \"terrifying\", saying there is huge competition for dollars with speculators willing to pay \"any price\". Meanwhile, the prices of consumer goods continue to rise.\n\nThe Iraqi government has introduced various measures to control the exchange rate, including reducing the official rate to 1,300 dinars. Though the black market rate has dropped to around 1,500 dinars, it remains highly volatile.\n\nThe impact of handing Iran large amounts of dinars - that it is now unable to trade for dollars - is still being felt.\n\n\"Paying Iranian debt in Iraqi dinars was not a calculated step. The financial crisis we are currently suffering from is caused by this stupid step,\" a senior Iraqi official told MEE.\n\nDespite having one of the largest oil reserves in the world, Iraq has suffered from severe energy shortages since the 1990s, due to conflicts, sanctions, mismanagement and a failure to develop infrastructure.\n\nIn recent summers, the lack of power, drinking water and other essential services has prompted mass demonstrations, especially in the south.\n\nTo patch over the supply issues, Iraq has had to import energy and gas - much of it from Iran next door.\n\nOfficially, Iraq spends around $900 million a month on Iranian goods, according to Iranian officials, 50% of which are for electricity and gas.\n\nAware of Iraq's precarious situation, Washington has exempted Iraq from its sanctions on Iran, but problems in paying for the purchases arose from day one.\n\nThe United States only agreed to waive sanctions if Iraq placed the funds in the Trade Bank of Iraq with the understanding that it would be used later by Iran to pay for food and medicine.\n\n\"However, this was not enough for Iran, as the account's movement is subject to American control,\" an Iraqi official said.\n\nIran instead demanded another way to receive its money and used threats to the energy supply as a way to pressure Baghdad into giving it what it wants.\n\nIn October 2019, the energy shortages became an existential crisis for Iraqi authorities, when huge demonstrations rocked various central and southern provinces, as well as Baghdad.\n\nPrime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, and his backer, Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, sought to find quick solutions to the intractable problems that Iraq suffers from, including the Iranian debt, officials told MEE.\n\nLater, in April 2022, when Iraq was swept up in a political vacuum following the inconclusive elections the previous October, the Sadrists suggested an emergency law to act as a mini-budget.\n\nThe debt to Iran that had accumulated since 2019 was one of the most pressing issues for Kadhimi's government at the time.\n\n\"Sadr had to find a way out for his ally,\" one of Kadhimi's former advisors told MEE.\n\nAt the same time, Sadr wanted to present \"a gesture of goodwill to the Iranians to prove that his project does not target them or threaten their interests,\" the adviser said.\n\nThe law allocated 4 trillion Iraqi dinars (about $3 billion) \"to pay off the electricity ministry's foreign debt and the debts for the purchase of gas and energy\".\n\nThat June, the parliament approved the law and the Iraqi government started to pay what it owed directly to Iranians in dinars. The last payment was in October, officials said.\n\nThe exact amounts paid by the Kadhimi government to Iran in dinars were not disclosed, but it was not the first time this had happened.\n\nIn February 2019, the Central Bank of Iraq concluded an agreement with the Central Bank of Iran, allowing customers of both banks to open accounts in the two countries and conduct their banking transactions in dinars and euros.\n\nThe Iraqi Central bank said at the time this was done \"to remove obstacles to paying Iraq's debts related to gas and electricity exports\".\n\nAn Iraqi politician close to Tehran told MEE he believed Washington predicted the strain on Iraq's currency when it allowed Baghdad to pay Iran in dinars.\n\n\"If they didn't, then they missed a lot,\" he said.\n\n\"The Iranians are very smart and they are investing in all the details that serve their goals. They were clear from the beginning. They said if you could not pay in dollars, pay in dinars and leave it to us,\" he added.\n\n\"It is not their problem if their rival is arrogant and treats others as helpless, and they will follow their own paths.\"",

The President undoubtedly hopes to assure voters ahead of the November elections that he is winding down the war. The irony is that current progress in Iraq was enabled by the Bush Administration's surge policy, which President Obama, Vice President Joseph Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and many members of this Administration opposed.\n\nBut the President should now make every effort to avoid squandering the hard-won security gains of the surge by withdrawing too many troops too fast. Iraq still needs substantial U.S. military, diplomatic, and political support to defeat various insurgent groups, stave off a possible return to civil war, and contain Iran's expanding influence.\n\nNeeded: A Resolute Commander-in-Chief\n\nObama's speech should soberly acknowledge that the war in Iraq continues and is not yet won. Iraq remains afflicted by a low-grade insurgency, chronic terrorism, and simmering sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shias, Kurds and Arabs, Muslims and Christians, and other minorities.\n\nThe President should present a realistic picture of the situation and clearly proclaim his Administration's commitment to finishing the job: stabilizing Iraq to protect vital American interests. He should reassure anxious Iraqis and U.S. allies in the region that he will not complacently declare victory and abandon the struggling Iraqi government, leaving a vacuum that would inevitably be exploited by Iran, Syria, al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), and other Islamist extremist groups.\n\nThe President's speech will mark the transition from Operation Iraqi Freedom to Operation New Dawn, in which many of the 50,000 remaining U.S. troops (down from more than 170,000 at the height of the surge) will be embedded with Iraqi security forces to train, advise, equip, and assist them in their efforts to secure and stabilize Iraq. In truth, the Administration's self-imposed \"end of combat\" is a semantic distinction that does not adequately reflect the situation on the ground. Hostile Iraqi and foreign forces in Iraq have not ended their attacks on allied forces. American troops will remain in harm's way and must be ready to defend themselves and support Iraqi security forces.\n\nThe President should acknowledge Iraq's urgent need for continued American military backing. On August 12, Iraq's top military leader, General Babaker Zebari, warned that Iraqi security forces will not be able to fully secure their own country until 2020. \"If I were asked about the withdrawal,\" he said, \"I would say to politicians: The U.S. Army must stay until the Iraq Army is fully ready in 2020.\" The general's warning came a week after the former foreign minister of Saddam Hussein's regime complained that the U.S. was \"leaving Iraq to the wolves.\"\n\nIraq is still roiled by waves of political violence. Insurgent networks have been battered but not defeated. AQI and its affiliated groups have made a comeback and continue to slaughter policemen, government officials, and civilians on a daily basis. Nearly 500 civilians were killed in July, the highest monthly death toll since 2008 -- although the carnage remains far below the peak of violence experienced during 2006-2008.\n\nLast week insurgents launched a campaign of terrorist attacks across the country, killing hundreds of innocent civilians, police, and government officials. On Wednesday -- the same day insurgents launched coordinated attacks on 13 cities and towns throughout Iraq that claimed 51 lives -- an insurgent Web site proclaimed, \"The countdown has begun to return Iraq to the embrace of Islam and its Sunnis, with God's permission.\"\n\nThe Continuing Need for U.S. Military Involvement\n\nAlmost six months after Iraq's March 7 parliamentary elections, political leaders have been unable to cobble together a new coalition government. The Shia majority fear a return to the past, in which Iraq was dominated by a Sunni-led dictatorship. The Sunni minority fears the future, which could marginalize and exclude them from power. The Kurdish minority fears both the past -- in which they suffered terribly in a genocidal campaign launched by Saddam Hussein's regime -- and a future in which their desire for greater autonomy, if not outright independence, is violently rejected by Iraqi Arabs as well as neighboring regimes in Turkey, Iran, and Syria, as each fear a rebellion by their own Kurdish minorities. The distrust among Shia, Sunnis, and the Kurds is so great that they trust the U.S. military more than they do each other.\n\nThe longer the political paralysis persists, the more Iraq's rudderless government will be discredited in the eyes of the increasingly exasperated Iraqi people -- a situation that will, in turn, hand insurgents a better opportunity to reclaim the initiative and create a yawning power vacuum that would invite escalating interventions by Iran, Turkey, Syria, and foreign Islamists.\n\nIn recent months Iran has built a fort inside Iraqi territory and attacked Iranian Kurdish opposition forces that have found sanctuary in northern Iraq, Turkey has attacked Kurdish separatists who have established bases across the Iraqi border, and Syria continues to allow Iraqi Baathists and Sunni Islamist extremists to use its territory as a sanctuary.\n\nNext Steps in Iraq\n\nTo prevent the situation from deteriorating further, the President should signal that the U.S. remains firmly engaged as a dependable ally of Iraq and dispel the growing perception that Washington is intent on a quick exit regardless of the dangerous consequences of such a gamble. To help resolve the political stalemate, the Obama Administration should proactively work behind the scenes to facilitate Iraqi political compromises, thereby ensuring the emergence of a broad-based, inclusive government capable of addressing Iraq's many problems.\n\nThe President should also reassure nervous Iraqis that he will maintain adequate numbers of U.S. troops to shore up Iraq's gradually improving security forces, protect American officials and civilians, and work closely with Iraqis to keep the heat on AQI and other hostile groups. The Administration wisely abandoned Obama's campaign pledge to withdraw one combat brigade from Iraq every month after entering office. The protracted efforts to form a government after Iraq's postponed elections have reinforced the continuing need for U.S. military forces to backstop Iraqi security forces and help prevent a plunge into a civil war fueled by Sunni Islamist extremists and pro-Iranian Shia militants.\n\nOnce a new Iraqi government is formed, the Obama Administration should quietly negotiate a revised status of forces agreement (SOFA) to postpone the deadline for a final troop withdrawal. It is clear that Iraqi security forces will not be ready to stand on their own by the end of 2011, when all U.S. troops are required to leave under the 2008 SOFA. Substantial U.S. air support, logistics, intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, communications, training, and advisory support will still be required long after that date.\n\nThe Administration should also reconsider its decision to transfer hundreds of tasks from the military to the State Department, some of which -- such as training Iraqi police -- Foggy Bottom is ill equipped to accomplish.\n\nThese prudent revisions in U.S. policy can help ensure that a responsible drawdown of U.S. troops brings a successful transition to stability in Iraq.\n\nAn Opportunity to Shore Up Public Support for Afghan War\n\nTuesday's address also provides President Obama a critical opportunity to explain why and how U.S. forces must succeed in Afghanistan. U.S. force levels are ramping up in Afghanistan as the last of the 30,000 additional troops arrive in theater, mainly in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand.\n\nYet just as the new counterinsurgency strategy is getting underway and the Afghanistan war is finally receiving the kind of resources, troops, and leadership it deserves, American public support for the war is dipping. A recent poll revealed that nearly six in 10 Americans oppose the Afghanistan war and only 38 percent (down from 46 percent in March) support expanding the war effort.\n\nAmerican public questioning of the war is in large part attributable to President Obama's failure to explain on a regular basis his Administration's strategy and to remind the American people why it is so critical for the U.S. to prevail in the fight. On the few occasions when he has talked about Afghanistan and Pakistan, he has correctly stated that rooting out international terrorism from both countries is important for U.S. national security, but he has failed to explain how sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan supports that goal.\n\nDrop Timeline\n\nPresident Obama should clarify U.S. policy on Afghanistan and state that he is determined to bring the troops home with honor by achieving success in Afghanistan. The President made a major strategic error by establishing a July 2011 timeline for beginning the drawdown of U.S. troops, which has encouraged Afghan insurgents, discouraged Afghan allies, given Pakistan greater incentive to maintain ties with Afghan insurgents to maximize its influence in Afghanistan after a U.S. withdrawal, and undermined the prospects for success of General David Petraeus's counterinsurgency strategy.\n\nRetiring Marine General James Conway told reporters last week that the July 2011 withdrawal date has given a morale boost to Taliban insurgents who now believe they can simply wait out NATO forces. President Obama should assure the American people that his Administration is united behind the current counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan and that he and his team are committed to success.\n\nPresident Obama should use the speech to make clear that troops will be withdrawn according to conditions on the ground as appraised by the capable General Petraeus, not according to arbitrary and unrealistic deadlines imposed from Washington. Clinging to a July 2011 withdrawal timeline would hamstring counterinsurgency efforts and set General Petraeus up for failure. The Administration should avoid making the same mistake it made by retaining its unrealistic deadline for closing down the Guantanamo detention facility long after it knew that the deadline could not be met.\n\nThe President should also explain that the al-Qaeda threat spans the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan and that uprooting Taliban influence on both sides of the border is essential to destroying al-Qaeda's network and power base. President Obama should reiterate that the leadership of the Taliban and al-Qaeda are still allied and that a Taliban victory in Afghanistan would embolden al-Qaeda and make the U.S. more vulnerable to future attacks. He should link the failed Times Square bombing attempt -- as well as the other terror plots that have been exposed in the last few years -- to stabilizing Afghanistan.\n\nExplain Pakistan Policy\n\nAchieving U.S. objectives in Afghanistan would also help ensure stability in Pakistan by increasing pressure on that country to:\n\nIn this vein, the President should explain his policy toward Pakistan and address whether the Administration has been able to garner the Pakistan government's sincere cooperation against the Afghan Taliban and related groups fighting U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nOfficials within the Obama Administration have trumpeted their success in convincing Pakistani military leaders to go after terrorists that attack the Pakistani state. While this is a welcome development and one that is important for Pakistani stability, the American people want to know if Pakistan is helping or hurting the U.S.'s ability to succeed in Afghanistan. The coordinated attacks on two U.S. bases in eastern Afghanistan over the weekend -- reportedly undertaken by militants directed by the powerful Haqqani network located in North Waziristan -- will raise fresh questions about how the U.S. should address terrorist sanctuaries on Pakistan's side of the border.\n\nIraq, Afghanistan, and the Future of U.S. Security\n\nWinning in Afghanistan would ensure that that country does not again serve as a safe haven for terrorists intent on attacking the U.S. homeland. By defeating those Taliban allied with al-Qaeda and bolstering the Afghan authorities' ability to resist these elements on their own, America would guard against the potential for future terrorist attacks in the U.S. Winning requires renouncing any predetermined timeline and fully resourcing the U.S. military counterinsurgency strategy.\n\nIn both Afghanistan and Iraq, bolstering the security of local allies is crucial to the long-term success of U.S. policy in both regions and in the broader war against terror. And U.S. troops should be part of this effort for many years to come. As a candidate, Barack Obama could afford to indulge in irresponsible rhetoric about \"ending\" the war in Iraq without regard for the disastrous consequences of losing that war. But as President, Obama should act decisively as the nation's commander-in-chief and protect vital American interests by successfully finishing the jobs in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
