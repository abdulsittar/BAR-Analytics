                    "body": "By Simon Alvarez Posted on March 8, 2023\n\nTesla China's exports in February remained strong, and domestic vehicle sales saw an improvement compared to January. This was according to data recently released by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).\n\nAs per the CPCA, Tesla China exported 40,479 cars in February, a 3.24% improvement over the 39,208 units that were exported in January. Considering Tesla China's export numbers and the company's 74,402 wholesale results last month, domestic sales for February appear to be 33,923 vehicles.\n\nFor context, Tesla China's domestic sales in January 2023 were listed at 26,843 units. With this in mind, February's results suggest a 26.38% improvement month-over-month. It should also be noted that these results were achieved at a time when Gigafactory Shanghai's Model 3 line was suspended during February's final days to make way for upgrades.\n\nTesla China's wholesale results for February were comprised of 51,412 Model Y units and 22,990 Model 3 vehicles. The breakdown for these vehicles' export and domestic figures is yet to be released.\n\nGigafactory Shanghai is a crucial part of Tesla's global operations. The facility is currently the company's largest factory by output, with an estimated capacity of about 1.1 million vehicles annually. This output could improve further, especially with the implementation of improvements to the Model 3 line.\n\nPrevious reports have indicated that Tesla is currently pushing \"Project Highland,\" which is expected to introduce updates to the Model 3 sedan. The updates will reportedly encompass the car's exterior, interior, and powertrain, among others. The updates to the Model 3 are expected to make the vehicle easier to manufacture as well.\n\nTesla is also reportedly working on \"Project Juniper,\" which is aimed at updating the Model Y crossover. Similar to \"Project Highland, the updates to the Model Y are expected to be rolled out to the car's exterior and interior. These upgrades would likely make the Model Y even more compelling to consumers, allowing it to sell even better than before.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact us with news tips.

                    "title": "Analyst downgrades Tesla stock after 50% pop",
                    "body": "Tesla's stock is overdue for a downshift into neutral after a sizzling 54% year to date run, warns one Wall Street analyst.\n\nBerenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock to hold from buy on Wednesday, citing mostly valuation relative to when bets on a cheaper new vehicle model and other technologies would bear fruit.\n\n\"We downgrade our rating to Hold now that our Buy thesis - based on misplaced fears of a price war - appears to have been accepted by the market,\" Yanoshik said. \"We argued that Tesla can take market share at a gross margin of c25% (excluding credits), which indeed is where we see investor expectations heading for 2024.\"\n\nShares of the EV maker fell more than 1% in pre-market trading.\n\nThe downgrade comes on the heels of a mixed week or so of news for Tesla, as Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports. Tesla's overhyped investor day underwhelmed the masses as it didn't unveil a speculated cheaper new model. Then, the company cut prices again to stoke demand -- this time on the high-end Model X and Model S. Early Wednesday morning, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also announced a probe into the Model Y related to a potential steering-wheel issue.\n\nTo that end, Yanoshik's Tesla downgrade makes a couple key points for investors to consider:\n\n#1: Tesla's Valuation Isn't Cheap\n\nTesla's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46 times, compared to 20 times for the S&P 500, as investors bake in above-market growth rates for the EV beast.\n\nBut with interest rates headed higher and competition from Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) rising, Tesla's valuation leaves little room for error operationally, Yanoshik pointed out.\n\n\"Valuation now leaves less room for disappointment,\" Yanoshik says.\n\n#2: There Is No $25,000 Tesla Yet\n\nInvestors have been clamoring for a cheaper \"Model 2\" from Tesla under the $30,000 price point. Musk has teased Tesla is working on it, but acknowledges it will take time as it tries to bring down battery and other production costs further.\n\nYanoshik thinks investors need to adjust their timeline on when a cheaper Tesla will arrive and start contributing to profits.\n\n\"New vehicle segment may boost market size by 75% but likely to take time: Moving into a smaller vehicle segment would open up a significant volume opportunity. It could expand Tesla's total addressable market (TAM) by [$1 trillion excluding credits], which is 75% larger based on our forecast of market size in 2026. We model a slow rollout in the segment, however, not breaking through a 1 million vehicle delivery run-rate (roughly our 2023E Model Y volume) until 2028,\" Yanoshik notes.\n\nThe call for patience from Tesla on the cheap car front is something echoed by JP Morgan auto analyst Adam Jonas.\n\n\"From our experience, auto companies don't typically unveil far cheaper and potential better engineered products far in advance of SOP. Imagine you just placed an order for a $50k Model Y and Tesla tells you there will be a slightly smaller version for \u00bd the price with enhanced capabilities available soon. ... From a commercial standpoint, maybe not the best strategy,\" Jonas said in a recent note.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Analyst Adrian Yanoshik downgraded Tesla to hold from buy, saying the electric vehicle stock has less upside from here. Shares are already 52% higher this year. \"Tactical price changes reflect cost-leadership strategy: Tesla's new plants offer multi-year opportunity in capital and labour efficiency,\" Yanoshik wrote to clients on Tuesday. \"However, we downgrade our rating to Hold now that our Buy thesis - based on misplaced fears of a price war - appears to have been accepted by the market.\" Investors piled into the stock this year as Tesla unveiled a series of price cuts to drive greater electric vehicle adoption and claim market share -- a decision that appears to have stoked demand with CEO Elon Musk saying Tesla is seeing orders of about twice the rate of production . Tesla most recently cut prices on the Model S and Model X , its two most expensive models in the U.S. \"We argued that Tesla can take market share at a gross margin of c25% (excluding credits), which indeed is where we see investor expectations heading for 2024,\" Yanoshik wrote. Even so, the analyst said he prefers other automakers in his coverage, as the valuation now \"leaves less room for disappointment. His $210 price target implies shares could rise about 11% from Tuesday's closing price. The stock was down more than 1% in the Wednesday premarket. -- CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

                    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is eager to expand the company's reign in the electric vehicle (EV) market by offering a diverse range of products, including a more affordable EV. Although he had previously stated his desire for a product cheaper than the current most affordable Tesla Model 3, Musk has now shared crucial details about the upcoming smaller EV.\n\nTesla is developing a new electric vehicle that is expected to be significantly more affordable than their current offerings. According to CEO Elon Musk, the new EV will cost about half as much to manufacture as the Model 3. Musk also revealed that the car will operate mostly in autonomous mode, but he did not provide any timeline for its release. These details are significant, given that Musk has previously acknowledged that Tesla's current EVs are desirable but not affordable for many consumers.\n\nFor Tesla, prioritizing affordability is crucial in order to tap into new markets and achieve its goal of producing 20 million EVs annually by 2030. To make this happen, the company has been exploring potential locations for new production facilities and is said to be in talks with Mexican officials for the construction of the world's largest EV factory.\n\nIn addition to the focus on affordability, Musk has stated that there are valid reasons to have a Tesla EV priced around $25,000 (approximately \u20b920.52 lakh). Currently, the cheapest Tesla model available is the Model 3, priced at around $43,000 (approximately \u20b935 lakh).\n\nTesla has already made efforts to attract more buyers by announcing price cuts in various markets, such as the US and China, which has led to competitors following suit. However, to succeed in new markets, particularly in developing countries, the company will need to maintain an affordable pricing structure. This is where the upcoming smaller EV could play a critical role.",

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Check out the full bracket\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Apmediaapi Tesla Musk Price Cut Demand Sales Auto Industry Technology Business General News Lifestyle Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

                    "body": "By Joey Klender Posted on March 7, 2023\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said the company's next-gen vehicle will operate almost entirely in autonomous mode, continuing a promise that investors and others have heard for years.\n\nMusk appeared in a conference with Morgan Stanley on Tuesday to mostly discuss Twitter, but during the latter half of the event, some questions regarding Tesla and SpaceX were fielded by the CEO.\n\nOne question that surfaced was regarding the potential capabilities of the company's next-gen vehicle, which was discussed last week during Tesla's Investor Day event.\n\nThe vehicle, which will be built at Tesla's newest factory in Mexico, is expected to operate \"almost entirely in autonomous mode.\" Tesla has been working to develop Full Self-Driving for several years, and Musk has routinely said for at least four years that Teslas would drive themselves. While the company has made remarkable progress on that front, the vehicles are still not capable of being fully autonomous.\n\nTesla Gigafactory Mexico will build the company's next-gen vehicle\n\nRecently, Tesla said its Full Self-Driving Beta was an SAE Level 2 System, which means the driver is operating the vehicle and must constantly supervise the car so that the functions, like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Automatic Emergency Braking, and other features, can operate.\n\nTesla's most crucial goal is autonomy, Musk said, after detailing that the next vehicle should cost roughly half of what the Model 3 would and that it would be geared toward self-driving.\n\nMusk said Tesla has a clear path to developing a car that would be affordable to most, which is one way the automaker can help more people drive sustainable powertrains.\n\nMusk did not offer a timeframe goal of when Tesla could roll out the new, next-gen vehicle, which will be a compact car. However, officials in Mexico believe Tesla could start building a vehicle, whether it's the next-gen model or not, at the plant sometime next year.\n\nAt an event in 2020, known as Battery Day, Musk said that Tesla should be able to deliver a $25,000 fully autonomous vehicle \"within the next three years:\"\n\n\"So we're confident that long-term we can design and manufacture a compelling $25,000 electric vehicle. This has always been our dream from the beginning of the company. I even wrote a blog piece about it because our first car was an expensive sports car, then it was a slightly less expensive sedan, and then finally sort of a, I don't know, mass market premium, the Model 3 and Model Y. But it was always our goal to try to make an affordable electric car. And I think probably, like I said, about three years from now, we're confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that's also fully autonomous.\"\n\nI'd love to hear from you!

                    "body": "What do these three stocks have in common? Broadly speaking, they're all EV stocks, and as such, when these companies are driving down the road of commerce, they all have to keep one eye on what Tesla is doing. With plans to grow its production of electric vehicles 37% this year, to 1.8 million EVs, you see, Tesla is the proverbial 800-lb. gorilla of the EV industry -- and right now, it seems intent on throwing its weight around.\n\nSpecifically, as The Wall Street Journal reported in its hard-copy edition this morning, Tesla has announced yet another round of price cuts on its automobiles. More specifically, it's cutting prices on Model S luxury electric sedans by $5,000 and on its Model X electric SUV by $10,000. Combined with other price cuts already announced, this is sparking a price war in EVs, with Lucid announcing special \"EV credits\" (temporary, targeted price cuts) last month and Nio reportedly offering discounts on some EV models too.\n\nSo far, there hasn't been word of any price cuts at Nikola, which doesn't yet compete with Tesla -- but it might soon have to now that Tesla Semi deliveries have begun.\n\nSo what does the future hold for these three companies as Tesla throws its weight around, cutting prices and undercutting the competition? I'm afraid the news might not be good.\n\nAccording to the latest data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Tesla boasts a war chest of more than $22 billion, and it's generating positive free cash flow at the rate of $7.5 billion more dollars every year. In contrast, both Nio and Lucid were burning cash at last report, and their balance sheets look significantly weaker than Tesla's -- $5.6 billion in cash for Nio and just $3.9 billion for Lucid.\n\nOf the three, Nikola's position is the most tenuous. With less than $240 million in cash to its name, Nikola is burning through roughly $750 million per year, and it will be out of cash again in just a few months. Even if it wanted to cut prices to compete with Tesla and its Semi, I'm not sure it would be able to do so and still remain solvent.\n\nLong story short, investors in competing EV stocks are nervous about the price war that Tesla has just declared. And they're right to be.",

                    "body": "Tesla has cut prices on its two most expensive electric vehicles in the United States, according to the company's website, days after chief executive Elon Musk said recent price cuts on other models had spurred demand.\n\nThe Guardian reported the price cuts, Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year, ranged from 4% on the performance version of the Model S to 9% on the more expensive Model X.\n\nThe UK paper noted Musk had said repeatedly in recent months Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and it had seen success in boosting orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk reportedly said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment on the most recent price cuts.\n\nThe Guardian noted Tesla had slashed prices on its cars across all its markets in January, offering discounts of up to 20% in what many analysts saw as the start of a price war by the electric vehicle market leader.\n\nIt had been adjusting prices since with a pace and frequency that goes beyond what established automakers had attempted in an industry where a car's base price is still referred to as a 'sticker price' on a vehicle in stocl.\n\nThe report said the Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance Plaid editions, accounted for about 4% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. Its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, made up the rest.\n\nThe Guardian said Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model S by US$5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.\n\nThe newspaper report noted Tesla had a new version of the Model 3 codenamed Highland scheduled to go into production later this year and a change to the Model Y codenamed Juniper for next year.",

                    "body": "By William Johnson Posted on March 7, 2023\n\nThe Tesla Model Y remains Germany's favorite EV, according to data released by the KBA today.\n\nWhile the Tesla Model 3 was the vehicle that redefined the Tesla brand thanks to its affordability, the Tesla Model Y has quickly surpassed its popularity. Now, the Model Y is often the most popular EV sold in many significant markets, including in Germany, where it has recently taken back its crown as the top EV from the Model 3.\n\nAccording to the KBA, the German agency that tracks car registrations, the Tesla Model Y was the most popular EV in the country during February, selling 6,442 vehicles. This was a massive jump compared to January, when Tesla sold only 3,708 Model Ys. Reflecting this success, the EV market grew by just over 14% in the same timeframe.\n\nThe Model Y was unable to regain its crown as the most popular vehicle overall in Germany; that honor returned to the ever-popular Volkswagen Golf, which sold 7,655 units.\n\nModel-specific data follows the KBA's market report yesterday that revealed that the country had seen a considerable drop in diesel and PHEV sales, which likely helped push the EV marketshare to record highs during February.\n\nAs part of that market push, Tesla's marketshare bloomed as well, increasing to 3.7% of the total market. Tesla sales were up 90% in the first two months of the year compared to the first two months of 2022.\n\nWith Tesla continuing its massive production ramp, many anticipate that the American automaker will continue to see sales dramatically increase, especially as it continues to cut prices on its most popular models. However, more and more competition is entering the market by the year, and Tesla will quickly need to transition to defending its marketshare from the growing number of new offerings.\n\nWhat do you think of the article?

Like many fledgling companies, Tesla repeatedly overpromised and seemed to underestimate the difficulty of starting a clean-sheet manufacturing operation, especially in the hidebound and prohibitively expensive auto industry.\n\n\"What turned me off about Tesla early on was Musk's attitude -- that he was going to Silicon-Valley-ize the car business,\" Brauer said. He also said the company's predictions for its first car's performance kept getting less ambitious. The company's two-seat Roadster was based on a Lotus sports car and seemed to some like a classic \"kit car,\" which many found unimpressive even though the car looked sharp and had a fun-to-drive reputation.\n\nFor many years the outlook was poor, at least to people outside the company. During Wednesday's earnings call Musk said industry research firm IHS Automotive predicted the company would sell 3,000 cars at most before withering. Today an IHS spokesman declined to comment on the alleged forecast, but did not deny it.\n\nThis week the company said it has delivered more than 13,000 cars to customers so far in North America and its overall performance has been stunning. But that doesn't mean all the doubt has disappeared.\n\n\"I'm surprised by how well they appear to be doing,\" said Art Spinella, president of CNW Research in Bandon, Ore. \"Musk has obviously put together a team that can actually work through the issues one at a time,\" he said.\n\nSpinella says he was \"skeptical like 99% of the people who follow this industry,\" but lately has become increasingly impressed with the company and its cars. But there are hurdles, like Tesla's continuing battle with franchise laws that don't allow car makers to operate their own dealerships, and the still-high price of Tesla vehicles.\n\nSpinella has been in and around the car business for decades and has seen other promising products fail. He talks about test-driving a DeLorean in the early 1980s just before they went on sale. Though sleek in appearance, the stainless-steel, gull-winged coupe was \"awful,\" he said.\n\nThe Tesla Model S is a much nicer ride, though Spinella, who favors motorcycles and souped-up cars, said he isn't quite in love with it. \"It's OK,\" he says. \"Better than the DeLorean.\"",

                    "body": "Two of Tesla's most expensive electric vehicle (EV) models in the US have had their prices cut, in effort to stoke demand\n\nTesla is once again demonstrating it is not immune to the economic downturn and global uncertainty that is currently impacting consumer spending habits.\n\nReuters reported that Tesla has cut prices on its two most expensive electric vehicles in the United States, according to the company's website.\n\nThis move comes just days after CEO Elon Musk said recent price cuts on other models had stoked demand.\n\nPrice cuts\n\nReuters noted that the latest price cuts are Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year, and ranged from 4 percent on the performance version of the Model S, to 9 percent on the more expensive Model X.\n\nMusk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\nTesla in early January cut prices on all of its models in the United States, by $2,000 for each car, in an effort to offset a reduction in a federal tax cut for buyers of the electric vehicles.\n\nLater that month Tesla abruptly cut its EV prices in China, following an earlier round of price reductions in October 2022.\n\nTesla took the decision in response to the slowing demand in China, and cut prices for its Model 3 and Model Y cars by up to 9 percent in China, and offered insurance incentives.\n\nRead also : SpaceX Launches Space Station Crew In NASA Mission\n\nBut the second price reductions left many Tesla owners in China angry at missing out on the price cuts.\n\nAs a result, hundreds of angry Tesla buyers in China gathered at the electric carmaker's showrooms and distribution centres across the country to protest about missing the price reductions.\n\nPosts on Chinese social media showed crowds of vehicle owners at stores and distribution centres in Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen and other cities.\n\nCar owners ransacked a Tesla Experience Centre in Chengdu in the southwestern Sichuan province and posted a handwritten list of demands signed with names and fingerprints, according to videos circulating on social media.\n\nNot to be put off, a week later Tesla applied similar price reductions for customers in Western markets.\n\nTesla had cut prices by up to a fifth in US, UK and Europe as it contends with slowing demand and increased competition.\n\nFor example, the price of the cheapest Model 3 saloon car, the rear-wheel drive version, dropped by \u00a35,500 to \u00a342,990.\n\nStoking demand\n\nNow Reuters reported that Musk has once again lowered the price of Tesla EVs, in an effort to stoke demand.\n\nRead also : Tesla To Build Factory In Mexico, Says President\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk was quoted as saying last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the most recent price cuts.\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5 percent to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4 percent to $109,990, Reuters noted.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9 percent to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8 percent to $109,990.\n\nProduction slowdown\n\nJust after Christmas 2022 it was reported that Tesla planned to run its key Shanghai plant on a reduced schedule in January 2023, continuing its reduced production that began earlier in December.\n\nThe Shanghai plant, with about 20,000 workers, accounted for more than half of Tesla's production for the first three quarters of 2022.\n\nIn January Tesla revealed it had shipped a record 1.3 million vehicles last year, a 40 percent increase from the previous year, but it had missed analysts' expectations.\n\nRead also : China Warns Elon Musk Over Wuhan Lab Leak Tweet",

According to data from hubspotin the United States in 2021 60 percent of companies reported that they had used some pricing strategy as a strategy to drive demand.\n\nAn example was Apple, in 2020, when the price of iPhone SE It was reduced by 50 dollars with the idea of generating sales in a group of people for whom the phones of the Cupertino brand were impossible to buy.\n\nAccording to Apple, that marketing strategy resulted in an increase in demand for the iPhone SE of 33 percent in the second three months of that year.\n\nsomething similar did Amazon in 2018 with the price of its Prime membership for low-income customers. And, in 2023, is what he did Netflix with the price of their plans in some countries.\n\nThe problem with this kind of strategies: cannot be sustained over time if income is not enough to cover costs when inflation hits the value of raw materials.\n\nThe novelty in this regard this Tuesday, March 7, comes from Tesla, company that decided to reduce the sale price of two of its most expensive models, the Model S and the Model X.\n\nIt is a new cut, which is added to those that had already been applied in 2022, he says Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn effect, Tesla cut the base price of its Model S luxury sedan from $94,900 to $89,900, representing a cut of about 5 percent.\n\nTesla also lowered the retail value of its Model X sport utility vehicle from $109,900 to $99,900, a decrease of about 9 percent.\n\nBetween the two models, they will make up about 5 percent of Tesla's total vehicle production in 2022.\n\nAs of early 2023, Tesla had lowered the price of its two best-selling cars: the Model Y was down 20 percent and the Model 3 was down 14 percent.\n\nThere are several confluent reasons for Tesla to carry out this strategy of lowering prices. On the one hand, to pressure their competition to do the same, reducing the profit margins of their rivals.\n\nOn the other hand, to reinvigorate their own demand. And finally, to allow some buyers to qualify for a $7,500 tax credit from the United States government.\n\nTesla is pushing to stay ahead of the competition with plans to ramp production to 20 million vehicles a year by 2030.\n\nIn 2022, it produced 1.3 million.\n\nThe company said last week that it plans to open a new auto production plant in Mexico.\n\nNow read:\n\nTesla seduces Samuel Garc\u00eda and this bought the brand\n\nTesla publishes first vacancy for Gigafactory in Nuevo Le\u00f3n\n\nThey register a child in honor of the creator of Tesla and Tigres player \"fanaticism or success\"",

                    "body": "Chief executive Elon Musk has credited previous reductions with boosting sales as EV competition heats up\n\nTesla has cut the prices of its most expensive models in the US for a second time this year, further unravelling earlier steep price increases that had contributed to a slump in demand in 2022.\n\nThe starting price of the Model S has been reduced 5 per cent to $89,990 while the cost of the lowest-priced Model X has come down 9 per cent to $99,990 (\u20ac93,770), according to the company's website.\n\nTesla announced significant price increases for many of its vehicles in 2021 and 2022 in the face of parts shortages and long waiting lists, only to reverse course in January this year as weaker demand and rising competition ate into sales.\n\nThe starting price of its Model X jumped from around $99,000 to more than $120,000 last year, helping to support Tesla's industry-leading profit margins but contributing to disappointing new vehicle deliveries in the final months of 2022.\n\nChief executive Elon Musk said last week that a round of price cuts in January across all markets and most of Tesla's models had an immediate impact in stoking higher sales.\n\n[ Tesla touts cost efficiencies as it gears up for more affordable model ]\n\nTom Zhu, head of Tesla China and the executive responsible for the company's global manufacturing plants, also said the price cuts had led to an increase in market share in China, where Tesla has faced a barrage of new competition.\n\nSpeaking at Tesla's first investor day, Musk claimed that demand for Tesla's vehicles was \"infinite\" and that the only thing holding buyers back was affordability, though he did not address the impact his company's earlier round of price increases had on dampening sales.\n\nTesla's stock price slipped more than 2 per cent on Monday, but Wall Street has welcomed Musk's aggressive moves to cut prices to defend sales this year, even at the risk of eating into profitability.\n\nThe shares have risen 80 per cent since the start of the year on hopes that Tesla will be able to take market share from rivals that are already struggling to make profits from electric vehicle sales.\n\n[ Tesla to recall nearly 363,000 cars over self-driving software flaw ]\n\nMusk shone a spotlight last week on the many actions Tesla has been taking across its operations to lower costs while still improving the performance of its vehicles.\n\nThe moves should enable it to cut the costs of manufacturing its next generation of electric vehicles by 50 per cent, he claimed, raising hopes for a new, lower-priced electric vehicle that will help Tesla fend off growing competition. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023",

                    "body": "Nickolas Catherine could have brought me an entirely new defect in a Tesla. In my years covering electric cars, I have seen dozens. Yet, his case surprised me not because it was something unusual or striking new: it was something I had been writing about for almost a year. It even had a recall in China. Yet, Tesla customers still get stranded with failing inverters in the rear drive units of their EVs. Why doesn't Tesla fix that? 28 photosPhoto: Dana Brems/Nickolas Catherine/Thomas George Exton/edited by autoevolution If you are not familiar with Catherine's story, he took delivery of a brand-new Tesla Model 3 RWD on February 27. The car stopped working on March 1 after running only 126 miles. The Tesla customer had to wait two hours for his EV to be towed back to a service center. When he learned that his Model 3 had faced a failed rear motor inverter, he searched for it and discovered my articles about the problem. After that, he found me on LinkedIn and allowed me to write his story.\n\nFar from being just another case emerging from the same issue, it marked how difficult it seems to be for Tesla to repair something that it certainly know is wrong for more than a year. On April 7, Tesla started a recall in China due to the very problem that turned Catherine's Model 3 into an expensive paperweight on a New Jersey avenue. The company told the Chinese government that the issue involved 127,785 units of the electric sedan produced from January 11, 2019, until January 25, 2022.\n\nPhoto: Nickolas Catherine Those trying to argue that the Chinese Model 3 is different from the American one certainly missed the recall notice. Of the 127,785 EVs, 34,207 units were made in the U.S. Curiously, Tesla did not propose to fix any Model 3 on American soil due to the inverter defect. It just informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) about it. I still wonder how Tesla managed to convince the American safety regulator that the rear motor inverter flaw had nothing to do with American cars when some of these vehicles needed repairs in China. The fact is that NHTSA never demanded Tesla do the same in the U.S.\n\nAnother strong evidence that this should have been the case was an article from ConsumerAffairs published on April 5, two days before the Chinese recall. It reported chronic problems with the Tesla Model Y, a vehicle that shares its underpinnings with the Model 3. Guess which the issue was? Exactly: the rear drive unit. The story mentioned TMC forum threads, and the oldest complaint I found happened on November 19, 2020. Remember: Tesla itself told the Chinese authorities cars made since January 2019 could have the issue.\n\nPhoto: Dana Brems/edited by autoevolution When ConsumerAffairs published its story, there was no information on what was causing the failure. Ironically, Tesla provided the answer, even if not for the press: there is no way to talk to the company, which should be the first and most representative red flag involving the EV maker. Anyone refusing to speak to the media is not dodging reporters: it is avoiding you. Even Tesla advocates have urged the company to be more transparent - to no avail.\n\nNew cases did not take long to emerge. In June 2022, Tesla halted deliveries of the Model Y Performance made in Germany because of rear motor failures. Some owners experienced them right after delivery, like Catherine. In October 2022, Dana Brems was driving from Los Angeles to San Diego when her Model 3 got stuck in the left lane of the I-5 freeway after a blind corner. Luckily, nothing more serious happened to her or her car. It was only the third time she drove her EV. She also wanted to get her money back but eventually kept the vehicle. Catherine said he would not back down on getting his money back: he does not trust the Model 3 anymore. Tesla has now threatened to charge him storage fees if he does not pick it up. Why would he if he just wants his money back?\n\nPhoto: TGE/YouTube On the other side of the pond, Thomas George Exton was driving his Model Y on December 8 in freezing-cold conditions when his car stopped. His experience was a true nightmare. Tesla eventually told him the Power Conversion System (PCS) in his electric SUV had failed. That's another name for an inverter. And now we have Catherine's case. You can bet there are several more people affected that just did not go public.\n\nLet's recap: there have been rear motor inverters failure events since November 2020. Tesla recalled vehicles made even earlier than that: starting in January 2019. Despite that, I have written about many more cases, the latest one involving a 2023 Model 3 with 126 miles on the clock. How come? Shouldn't the Chinese recall have indicated that Tesla would make sure no other vehicles would present this issue ever again? Why do they still fail?\n\nPhoto: TGE/YouTube It is pretty tricky to figure out what may be going on at the company with these faulty inverters. Are they part of a massive production batch that Tesla is still putting in new vehicles regardless of whether they have a known defect? Is it something the EV maker cannot change for whatever reason, so it keeps on making inverters that break down? Is it something Tesla has no idea how to fix, which means even the recalled Chinese vehicles may present the problem again? Only the EV maker can answer those questions. However, at this point, who would honestly believe it? Ignore shareholders and fans: they have financial and emotional investments to protect.\n\nThe undeniable reality that Nickolas Catherine's Model 3 and several other EVs before it showcased is that the defect persists. NHTSA may feel relieved it did not demand Tesla to perform the Chinese recall in the U.S.: all evidence suggests it would make no difference. Joking aside, that leaves Model Y and Model 3 owners with an excruciating question: when and why may they be in Catherine's shoes? Many were before him, and there is no sign that he will be the last to complain about that. I'll let you know who the next one will be.",

                    "body": "Fields believes that while companies like Ford and Hyundai are succeeding with EVs, Tesla is a generation ahead.\n\nOpinions were hot and cold about Tesla's recent Investor Day, much like they are about most of the US EV maker's events. There are some people who seem blown away by anything Tesla or Elon Musk does (or plans to do), and there are others who are always let down since they were expecting more. Interestingly, former Ford CEO Mark Fields had positive comments to make about the event during a CNBC segment.\n\nCEO Elon Musk and a whole host of Tesla executives and other team members talked for many hours last week about the company's successes and future. It was a presentation that was likely to bore people who were waiting for eye candy, such as some new vehicle reveal or people test-driving cars, etc. The next day, Tesla's stock dropped significantly and is still recovering.\n\nThat said, it appears former Ford CEO Mark Fields, who's now a CNBC contributor, was impressed with Tesla's event. He did admit that when you run an event that's specifically geared toward investors, there are certain expectations. He says you typically talk about the company's strategies, show off some new products, and reveal some concrete details and growth plans, financials, and the like.\n\nWhile Tesla and its team spent a great deal of time talking about strategies, there was very little during the presentation that was concrete or tangible. However, Field believes Tesla used the event to share its successes with the world. The company was out to prove yet again that it's the leader in the EV space by a huge margin and will continue to surge forward at its brisk pace.\n\nFields mentioned that even though automakers like Ford and Hyundai are moving forward with plenty of progress, Tesla is still one generation ahead. He said:\n\n\"And Tesla right now is one generation ahead of the other automakers. Tesla still has the leg-up on the competition, and I think they demonstrated that yesterday.\"\n\nThe former Blue Oval chief added that we should expect many winners in the EV race. Just like the current automotive industry, there's not just one main leader when it comes to petrol cars. There are many brands that are doing things well, and sometimes their strengths are different from their rivals, which creates healthy competition. Fields noted that there will also be many losers as the transition unfolds.",

                    "body": "Tesla is once again slashing the prices of its most expensive electric vehicle models. The EV maker is said to be cutting the rates by as much as $10,000.\n\nThis is the second time this year that Tesla has reduced the prices of its top car models. In January, it lowered the prices of its Model X and Model Y units by up to $21,000, and now, a new price reduction is waiting for new buyers in the United States.\n\nThe vehicles are two of Tesla's most expensive units, and the new price cuts are said to be a move in an attempt to increase the demand for its cars. The automaker is hoping that the big discounts will attract more customers as the Model S is now priced at $89,990 and up, which is five percent less than its previous price.\n\nOn the other hand, the Model X has a starting price of $99,990 now, and this shows a nine percent price reduction. For the plaid versions of the two car models, the starting price has been set to $109,990. This is four percent lower for the Model S Plaid units, while it is eight percent less for the Model X Plaid.\n\nCNBC reported that these new price cuts are likely related to EV tax credits that were launched in President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. in any case, Tesla's latest discount offerings follow a series of big discounts in recent months, making the brand's cars more affordable for households.\n\nBut then again, there are some Tesla buyers who are not pleased with the cuts because they said their vehicles' value also diminished. One owner told The Walls Street Journal she felt she got duped and taken advantage of as a consumer.\n\n\"Right off the bat, I'm out $13,306,\" she told the paper. \"It is such a large reduction that it's going to affect a lot of people who just bought a vehicle.\"",

                    "body": "This article was first published in the February edition of Fleet News.\n\nTesla's January price cut could not have come at a worse time for the used electric vehicle (EV) market, with the full impact not yet known, according to pricing experts.\n\nThe manufacturer announced overnight it was cutting the prices on the Model Y and Model 3 by thousands of pounds.\n\nPrice reductions were introduced in the US and European markets, with the Model 3 falling to \u00a342,990 and the Model Y to \u00a344,990, representing drops of \u00a35,550 and \u00a37,000 respectively, for the entry level models.\n\nPrices were also reduced by as much as \u00a38,000 on models higher in the range like the Model Y Performance.\n\nTesla's price drop, however, comes after prices were increased last year. The manufacturer upped the prices of the Model 3 and Model Y in the UK by more than 4% - \u00a32,300 on average - in June 2022.\n\nThen the entry-level rear-wheel drive Tesla Model 3 saloon was the subject of a \u00a32,500 price increase from \u00a345,990 to \u00a348,490, while the long-range variant of the Tesla Model Y SUV increased by \u00a32,000 from \u00a355,990 to \u00a357,990.\n\nFollowing the recent reduction, however, the price of a one-year-old standard range used Tesla fell by \u00a31,400 overnight, from an average of \u00a338,994 on January 15, to \u00a337,599 on January 16, according to data from Auto Trader.\n\nUSED EV MARKET\n\nPhilip Nothard, insight and strategy director at Cox Automotive, told Fleet News: \"With volumes of used EVs entering the market increasing by a reported 800% at the end of 2022, Tesla's re-pricing strategy couldn't have come at a worse time and the ripples have yet to reach the shore.\n\n\"Tesla has a different strategy from incumbent OEMs and is apparently less concerned about residual values (RVs) than its peers.\n\n\"It doesn't have the same retail infrastructure as the incumbents, and, while that has many observers scratching their heads about how used Teslas will fare in the used market, it also means they don't have retailers to appease either.\"\n\nHowever, Nothard added: \"If any OEM can navigate these stormy waters, it's probably Tesla.\"\n\nThe used battery electric vehicle (BEV) market, while recording its best-ever annual performance last year with a record 71,071 units sold, a rise of 37.5%, still represents a small proportion of overall used sales.\n\nUsed BEV transactions equated to just 1% of the used market in 2022, up from 0.7% in 2021. Sales of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) rose 8.6% and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEVs) transactions were up 3.6%.\n\nCombined, they represented 4.1% of the market (up from 3.3% in 2021).\n\nNEGATIVE IMPACT ON RVs\n\nIn such a fledgling market, dramatic reductions in used values for BEV models, not just Tesla, have been reported on some models in recent weeks, according to Cap HPI.\n\nIt says that the fall in RVs was entirely expected as part of a market adjustment to values that were previously unsustainably high and does not herald a collapse in demand for BEVs.\n\nThe used value for a one-year-old Tesla Model 3 long range with 20,000 miles on the clock has fallen by \u00a311,600, or more than 25%, since the middle of September.\n\nDylan Setterfield, head of forecast strategy at Cap HPI, explained: \"Used values for many BEV models were strong through 2022.\n\n\"In many cases, nearly-new retail values were above list price, some by a considerable margin.\n\n\"This was clearly unsustainable and our forecasts reflected that, with large negative adjustments applied.\"\n\nLooking beyond Tesla, Nothard says there is no doubt that used EVs are under \"scrutiny and pressure\", and they will be so for the foreseeable future.\n\nHe explained: \"It's a complex landscape with a demand versus supply imbalance, the price disparity between EV and ICE (internal combustion engine) and ongoing consumer concerns about charging infrastructure is coinciding with inflation and a cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\nHowever, he stressed: \"It's important to remember that all used vehicles, including electric ones, increased in value post-pandemic because of the shortage of new cars in the market. So, while we are in a depreciating marketplace with values dropping, prices remain inside the expected parameters in the main.\n\n\"The other dynamic we're seeing is a firming up of ICE vehicle values. As we enter a third year in new vehicle supply shortages, coupled with a decline in the number of petrol and diesel derivatives in the overall new vehicle parc, we could see used ICE values increase as demand remains strong.\"\n\nHe added: \"We still have to determine used EVs' final position in the market, and there may be some pain before finding the right level. But their prices will stabilise at some juncture - it's a matter of when and not if.\"\n\nJon Lawes, managing director at Novuna Vehicle Solutions, told Fleet News the used EV market had experienced price drops in recent months as the number of used vehicles returning to the market started to increase.\n\n\"The decrease in Tesla list prices looks like it has had a negative impact on confidence, but, in many cases, the used value reductions have just shifted models to more sensible levels,\" he said.\n\n\"In general, EVs still command a significant premium over comparable ICE vehicles and, while the Tesla price drop may have shaken confidence in the market today, leasing companies are forecasting residual values for three-and-four-years' time for new contracts.\n\n\"Price reductions are bound to be a hurdle to navigate on the road to EV mass adoption.\"\n\nFLEETS MANAGE FALLOUT\n\nLorna McAtear, fleet manager at National Grid, told Fleet News at 10, that, following the Tesla price cut, she had received a \"barrage\" of emails.\n\n\"Tesla is one of those companies that, as a fleet manager, you love and hate in equal measures,\" she said.\n\n\"It's an absolute headache, but we will end up with more vehicles back in price brackets that our drivers can get a hold of again in their banding.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Association of Fleet Professionals (AFP) chair Paul Hollick says both leasing companies and fleet managers hoped it would have been more of a \"contained change\".\n\n\"It just got dropped on us, which, for me, proves that Tesla is not a car for corporate fleets,\" he said. \"It's a retail solution.\"\n\nHollick says it could also be an issue for those that have just bought Teslas or have them on order at previous prices.\n\n\"The differences between the new and the old prices are substantial, and a move of this kind does, unavoidably, create ill-feeling,\" he said.\n\n\"The company would do well to introduce some kind of redress.\"\n\nA Tesla spokesperson said that any customers with orders should contact their sales representative to discuss the price changes.\n\nIn a statement, Tesla said: \"Our focus on continuous product improvement through original engineering and manufacturing processes has further optimised our ability to make the best product for an industry-leading cost.\n\n\"As we exit what has been a turbulent year of supply chain disruptions, we have observed a normalisation of some of the cost inflation, giving us the confidence to pass these through to our customers.\"\n\nLawes believes that Tesla's price drop is a sign that they are facing competition from existing and new entrants, and the recognition of a price point that could be unattainable to many. \"The demand for their product is still there, they just need their target audience to be able to access it,\" he said.\n\nNOT FOLLOWING TESLA'S LEAD\n\nThe Tesla Model Y was the most popular EV in Europe in 2022, according to data from Jato Dynamics.\n\nThe manufacturer sold 137,052 Model Ys in Europe giving it significant headway against rival vehicles. The second best-selling EV was the Tesla Model 3, with 91,475 registrations.\n\nHowever, Tesla's combined performance was not enough to secure the position of leading EV manufacturer.\n\nVolkswagen Group was the best-performing brand by volume, with 349,200 EVs registered across Europe in 2022.\n\nFleets hoping that other EV makers would follow Tesla's lead in cutting the prices of plug-in products will be left disappointed.\n\nStellantis, the parent company of several major brands, including Vauxhall, Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot, Fiat and Alfa Romeo, told Fleet News it had \"no plans\" to follow Tesla's lead by cutting prices.\n\nIt was a similar story at Volkswagen Group, responsible for VW, Audi, \u0160koda and Seat brands, which confirmed it would not be cutting plug-in prices any time soon.\n\n\"Our BEV order backlogs carry well into 2023, with some models already sold out for 2023,\" said a VW Group spokesperson. \"Our priority now is to deliver the vehicles to customers.\n\n\"We will continue to closely monitor further developments in both the cost and market situation for all-electric vehicles in all core markets and take appropriate action if necessary.\n\n\"As a matter of principle, we do not focus on the quantity of our business, but on its quality. High profitability, therefore, takes precedence over high volumes.\"\n\nKia UK also has no plans to cut prices on any of its current EVs. A Kia spokesperson said: \"We believe to do so would be detrimental to our relationships with private and fleet customers, and the residual values of our vehicles.\"\n\nFord announced it was cutting prices of its electric Mustang Mach-E crossover weeks after the Tesla announcement.\n\nHowever, its decision to lower pricing of the Mach-E by an average of about $4,500 (approx. \u00a33,700), dependent on the model, will only be available in the US.\n\nClick here to read more from Dylan Setterfield, head of forecast strategy at Cap HPI, on why he thinks that the timing of Tesla's price drop 'could not have been worse'.",

                    "body": "By Dylan Setterfield, head of forecast strategy, Cap HPI\n\nThe Tesla new car price reductions announced overnight on January 12 were significant, unexpected and widely publicised.\n\nWe may never know exactly what impact they had on used values, but the timing of the action, in the midst of a sharp downturn of used values for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), could not have been worse.\n\nIn the case of Tesla Model 3, used values had already decreased to the extent that nearly new used retail values were comfortably away from the revised list prices, but the impact on Model Y was to send used values for all three derivatives above cost new.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there was an immediate impact on used values and we expect further significant reductions on this model.\n\nModel 3, in particular, has been used across the industry as a comparison vehicle, even where it is not strictly a direct competitor vehicle for certain models.\n\nAs a result, the falls in Tesla Model 3 values are at least partially reflected in many other BEV models.\n\nAt Cap HPI we have made an additional negative adjustment to our forecasts due to a combination of reasons: an expectation of increased new car volume due to an improved competitive position (residual values and guaranteed future values are unlikely to decrease in pound note terms by as much as the list price reductions) and also the list price reductions potentially signal a move from a niche premium brand to a more mainstream, volume brand.\n\nLEVERS FOR OTHER MANUFACTURERS\n\nThere are also other levers that rival manufacturers could pull in an attempt to reduce Tesla's competitive advantage.\n\nAlthough most BEV models are subject to limited fleet discounts, some adjustment may be possible.\n\nMany will be looking very closely at their finance offerings to ensure interest rates are as competitive as possible and exploring whether there are any additional elements which can be incorporated into a new car deal, such as free servicing for a fixed period (unlikely to involve a large financial commitment for a new battery electric car).\n\nAs far as we are aware, most other OEMs are unlikely to follow suit with reductions to their own list prices.\n\nSome, like Kia, came out very quickly, keen to rule such a move out and distance themselves from Tesla's behaviour, while others have kept their cards closer to their chest.\n\nIt seems more likely that future planned list price increases may be cancelled, rather than making any attempt to match Tesla on the cost new front.\n\nSome manufacturers also have the option of bringing cheaper versions of their existing vehicles to market; either by including smaller batteries which are already available in other markets, or reducing specification deemed to be unessential or adding limited value in the used market.",

The Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive Model S now costs $89,990, while the Tri Motor, Plaid variant of the Model S costs $109,990. Similarly, Tesla's Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive Model X now costs $99,990, and the Plaid version will set you back $109,990.\n\nWhile the price reduction may not seem like a lot given the total price of these cars, it's worth remembering that all Tesla models got a lot cheaper in January. In total, the AWD Model S now costs $15,000 less than it did just two months ago; the AWD Model X costs $21,000 less.\n\nThe prices of Tesla's entry-level cars, the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, haven't changed in March.\n\nDuring the company's Investor Day on March 1, Tesla's China chief Tom Zhu said(Opens in a new tab) that the company is doing everything it can to cut costs \"and pass down that value to our customers,\" while CEO Elon Musk reiterated that \"even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand.\" Musk also said Tesla plans to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030; it currently produces about 1.31 million cars yearly.",

                    "body": "Tesla enthusiasts and customers in Europe noted that the company launched discounts on the Model 3 and Model Y in its inventory (or rather that will shortly arrive from China).\n\nAccording to various reports, the rebates spread across the continent and might be as high as 6-7 percent, compared to prices for new orders.\n\nThere are no reports about the Tesla Model S and Model X cars because those are newly launched in Europe (the refreshed versions) and there is probably a queue of customers waiting for cars.\n\nTroy Teslike reports that those who decide to buy cars from Tesla's inventory (brand new cars with less than 50 miles on the odometer), can save several thousand EUR, GBP or whatever the currency is in a particular market.\n\nThat's very interesting because Europe already saw a price reduction similar to the ones in the United States, Canada, China, and other markets around the world.\n\nThe answer behind the new discounts in Europe for Model 3/Model Y seems to be an insufficient number of orders (demand side) compared to the vehicle supply (partially from China and partially from the Giga Berlin plant in Germany).\n\nWe actually noted this issue in a separate report, related to the estimated order backlog. According to Troy Teslike's data, the queue was about 30,246 (35 days of waiting) as of January 15, while as of February 15, it was estimated at over 17,500 (22 days of waiting). In other words, the supply exceeds demand.\n\nIf such things happen, manufacturers risk that the inventory of new cars will start growing. Some might then decide to lower prices (discounts) to sell more cars. The higher number of cars from China, combined with record production in Germany, might bring a second wave of price reductions (for new orders).\n\nThere is no such issue in the United States because demand appears to be higher than production. Without a doubt, the situation in Europe is very interesting. If Tesla would lower prices by an additional several percent, it could be shocking, especially for other manufacturers, but for Tesla, it's another step to make EVs more popular and increase volume.",

Depending on the model and variant, the EVs now cost between 5,000 and 10,000 dollars less.\n\nThe Model S, for example, now starts at $89,990, down from $94,990, while the Model S Tri-Motor Plaid now costs $109,990 (down from $114,990), which is the same price as for the Model X Tri-Motor Plaid, which previously started at $119,990. The Model X Long Range now also costs $10,000 less, starting at $99,990 (previously $109,990).\n\nThe carmaker did not announce price cuts for the European market at this time.\n\nThis is not the first time the US EV manufacturer lowered prices to deal with supply chain difficulties and inflation. And, most importantly, to boost demand. In January, Tesla first reduced prices for all versions of its Model 3 and Model X in China. A few days later, the EVs also cost less in the US and Europe.\n\nA plan that - at least in China - apparently worked. After cutting production and extending Lunar New Year holidays there in November and January, the carmaker had to ramp up production at its Shanghai plant just weeks later to meet demand. According to Tesla, daily sales in China were up 36 per cent in January compared to same time last year.",

                    "body": "Earlier this year, Tesla heavily cut prices, stirring anger from some owners over the steep decrease in vehicle values. That hasn't deterred the automaker, as it recently lowered prices on the Model S and Model X.\n\nTwitter user Sawyer Merritt noticed the changes, which range from $5,000 to $10,000, depending on the model. The changes also bring the Model X Plaid and Model S Plaid even on pricing at $109,990. The Model S AWD price dropped from $94,990 to $89,990, and the Model X AWD dropped from $109,990 to $99,990.\n\nPrice changes on these expensive models won't have any impact on Tesla's tax credit eligibility, but its price cuts earlier this year did. The Model Y's lower price made it eligible for the $7,500 federal EV tax credits, though that could change in March as new rules take effect. Tesla was previously ineligible because it had sold more than the government's 200,000-unit limit.\n\nA few automakers jumped on the price-cut wagon after Tesla's previous cuts. Ford dropped the prices of some Mustang Mach-E models, but others have held their EV pricing steady. Hyundai, GM, and others did not cut costs, with Volkswagen saying it would rely on the strength of its products and focus on reliability.",

                    "body": "According to the company's website, Tesla Inc. has reduced pricing on its two most costly electric cars in the US, days after chief executive Elon Musk claimed that previous price reductions on other models had boosted demand. The price reductions, which marked Tesla's fifth change in pricing since the year's beginning, varied from 4% on the performance-oriented Model S to 9% on the more expensive Model X.\n\nMusk has emphasized numerous times in recent months that the EV giant will concentrate on lowering prices to increase demand and that the company has experienced success in generating orders with the global discounts implemented in January.\n\n\"The desire to acquire a Tesla is tremendous. Their financial capacity to purchase a Tesla is the limiting constraint\" Musk stated last week at the investor day for Elon Musk's company. Requests for feedback on the most recent price reductions received no immediate response from Tesla. In what many observers believed to be the beginning of a pricing war by the market leader in electric vehicles, Tesla lowered prices on its automobiles across all of its markets in January, providing reductions of up to 20%.\n\nSince then, it has been doing so at a pace and regularity that exceeds what traditional automakers have tried to do in a market where a car's base price is still referred to as a \"sticker price\" for a vehicle that is in stock. Around 4% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022 were of the Model S and Model X, which are available in performance \"Plaid\" and base all-wheel drive (AWD) models. The remaining two of its vehicles, the Model 3 sedan, and Model Y crossover, were more affordable.\n\nOn its website, Tesla announced a $5,000 price reduction for both versions of the Model S. Model S's entry-level pricing was reduced by 5% to $89,990, while the performance, Plaid variant's price was down by 4% to $109,990. According to the website of the electric vehicle manufacturer, prices for both the performance and entry-level Model X models were reduced by $10,000.\n\nThe cost of the Model X's entry-level AWD model was reduced by 9% to $99,990, while the price of its performance-oriented Plaid model was reduced by 8% to $109,990. Tesla has a new model of the Model 3 code-named \"Highland\" planned for release later this year, as well as a modified Model Y dubbed \"Juniper\" for release the following year.",

The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the most recent price cuts.\n\nTesla slashed prices on its cars across all of its markets in January, offering discounts of up to 20 percent in what many analysts saw as the start of a price war by the electric vehicle market leader.\n\nIt has been adjusting prices since with a pace and frequency that goes beyond what established automaker's have attempted in an industry where a car's base price is still referred to as a \"sticker price\" on a vehicle in inventory.\n\nThe Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance \"Plaid\" editions, represented about 4 percent of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. Its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, made up the rest.\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5 percent to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4 percent to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9 percent to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8 percent to $109,990.\n\nTesla has a new version of the Model 3 codenamed \"Highland\" scheduled to go into production later this year and a change to the Model Y codenamed \"Juniper\" for next year, Reuters has reported.",

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "By Maria Merano Posted on March 6, 2023\n\nLong-time TSLA bull ARK Invest predicts that Tesla will reduce vehicle costs by ~50% in the next five years. The analysts at ARK Invest based their prediction on Tesla's presentation during Investor Day 2023.\n\nTesla's presentation on Investor Day received mixed reviews. Many viewers expected more details on Tesla's ongoing projects, like the Cybertruck, and the company's next-generation vehicles. Usually, Tesla's presentations are more entertaining, but during Investor Day 2023, the company decided to get serious and shed some light on its direction. While specific details on the Cybertruck and next-generation vehicles were sparse, the presentation hinted at Tesla's next phase as a car manufacturer and more.\n\nIn a report, Ark Invest noted that Tesla showed all the steps it will take when producing its next-gen vehicle. Ark notes that four moves would impact the future of Tesla's vehicle costs and production, listed below.\n\nTesla plans to produce 100% of controllers in next-gen vehiclesTesla plans to switch to 48-volt battery architectureNext-gen Tesla vehicles will use local ethernet-connected controllers. Tesla will transition to a parallel assembly process.\n\nArk Invest believes switching to a 48-volt battery architecture should reduce power losses by 16-fold. While using local ethernet-connected controllers would decrease the complexity of the wire harness.\n\n\"These electrical architecture changes should cut costs and give Tesla more control over its supply chain at the component level. They also will enable Tesla to transition its manufacturing to a parallel assembly process, slashing its manufacturing footprint and wasted time by 40% and 30%, respectively,\" reported Ark Invest.\n\nTesla's Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn wrapped up the company's presentation on Investor Day 2023. He explained how each Tesla team -- from supply chain to production -- contributes to cost reduction through their innovative work.\n\n\"...as we find efficiencies, we work with our suppliers to do the same, and that leads to material cost reduction that improves the affordability of our products,\" stated Kirkhorn.\n\nHe noted that Tesla took out 50% of vehicle costs when going from the Model S and Model X platform to the Model 3 and Model Y platform. Tesla aims to reduce costs by another 50% in its next-generation vehicles.\n\nThe Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

                    "body": "GETTY IMAGES | Tesla has adjusted prices repeatedly since the start of the year\n\nTesla has cut prices for its electric cars - again - as it tries to boost sales and compete with rival firms.\n\nThe reductions - worth several thousand pounds, depending on the market and model - have been listed for sale on the company's website in the UK, US and elsewhere in recent days.\n\nThey follow big markdowns of up to 20% that the firm introduced in January.\n\nTesla is facing challenges as higher borrowing costs weigh on buyers and rivals offer more electric options.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment. Last year, the firm missed its 2022 target of increasing its deliveries by 50% annually, a shortfall the firm blamed on supply strain constraints and a weakening economy.\n\nBut boss Elon Musk has said previously that price cuts were working to lift demand.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Mr Musk said last week during a presentation to investors.\n\nMr Musk warned in January that he expected a \"pretty difficult recession\" to hurt demand this year, leading to a contraction for the wider industry.\n\nMr Musk said he expected Tesla sales to continue to grow, pointing to the firm's focus on price.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the latest round of cuts marks the fifth change Tesla has made to prices since the start of the year, when its markdowns shook up the electric car market, prompting some other firms to slash prices in response.\n\nTesla subsequently raised some prices for some models in some countries, but costs remain lower than they were.\n\nIn the US, the latest discounts range from 4% to 9% and apply to the firm's more expensive vehicles, the Model S, its sports car, and the Model X, mid-size sports utility vehicle.\n\nIn Europe and the UK, the cuts listed on the website apply to the Model 3 sedan and Model Y. In the UK, for example, the cost of versions of the Model 3 drop about 6% to \u00a356,540 from \u00a360,090.\n\nTesla's lead in the electric car market has also been challenged by increased competition from traditional motor manufacturing giants such as Ford and General Motors, as well as newer entrants to the market like Rivian and Lucid in the US and China's BYD and Nio.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]",

                    "body": "Tesla slashes prices for the Models S and X substantially\n\nWell well well, it looks like Tesla is back at it again, this time the brand is slashing the prices of two of its most expensive models, the Model S and Model X and the price cuts are rather substantial. The question now is, since Tesla has already been given the green light to set up shop in Malaysia, will we also see similar discounts here?\n\nOkay, so back in January, Tesla faced heavy criticism for reducing the price of some of its models but the thing that people were unhappy about is not the fact that Tesla had slashed its prices, that actually made many people happy, but the brand did not announce it in any way and instead just left it up to the people to realize.\n\nMoreover, this is not the first time the American electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer has done something like this as last year, Tesla had cut its prices in a few markets such as China but in some cases, the brand did not announce these price cuts. So now, we have to ask, why slash prices again?\n\nWhether Tesla is doing this out of desperation or if its CEO, Elon Musk, sees an opportunity that nobody else does is still unclear, but Musk clearly has a plan for the company with these price cuts, I just hope we get to see what it is soon but is is alarming to see that the Tesla Model X is now USD10,000 cheaper than before.\n\nWhile the USD5,000 lower price tag for the Tesla Model S is slightly less frightening, it is still very confusing nonetheless. It is also odd for the company as a few years ago, Musk did say that the brand would not ever introduce discounts even though the cars may be getting older, so why so many discounts now?\n\nOn top of that, this is actually the second time that Tesla is slashing prices for these two particular models as the brand cut the price of the Model S by USD10,000 in January of this year and USD11,000 from the Model X that same month. If the brand offers major discounts in Malaysia when it is established here then it may see massive sales.\n\nAfter all, the Tesla name is already well established and here in Malaysia, many people will choose luxury over anything else and since every other house already has a Rolls-Royce or Bentley, the only way to stand out would have to be a Tesla. However, knowing the brand's questionable reliability, it may not be the smartest choice.\n\nEither way, Tesla seems to have no problem selling its EVs in every market it is in despite having been hit by lawsuits, complaints and worse so perhaps people these days really do not care much for reliability as much as the badge you see on the front of your car.",

Reducing prices of S and the X models again suggests those vehicles may have gotten less of a boost from cuts the company made across its lineup seven weeks ago.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" Musk said during Tesla's March 1 investor day.\n\nTesla shares fell 0.8% as of 9:55 a.m. New York time Monday. The stock has climbed 61% this year after plunging 65% in 2022.\n\nThe Model S and X were just over 5% of Tesla's vehicle deliveries last year, so changing their pricing will have less of an effect on the company's bottom line and EV market dynamics than adjusting the cost of higher-volume vehicles. Still, the cuts are consistent with comments Musk and other executives made last week about squeezing expense out of how it designs, engineers and manufactures vehicles in order to unlock more demand.\n\n\"Tesla is sprinting in a global automotive marathon to cut costs, as they strive to be a global manufacturing champion that can give the company a sustainable competitive advantage,\" said Joel Levington, a Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst.\n\nTesla's dynamic pricing is unique in the automotive world, where manufacturers typically only make changes to what they suggest their retailers charge from one model year to the next. Reductions to the Model 3 and Y in January made those vehicles cheaper relative to the average price of a new vehicle in the US than ever before.\n\nThe changes to the 3 and Y were at least in part driven by Tesla wanting those models to qualify for tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act. After the Biden administration changed how it distinguished between passenger cars and sport utility vehicles in early February, thereby raising the price limit for Model Ys to be eligible for credits, Tesla bumped prices back up.",

                    "body": "In explaining why Tesla Inc keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles by between US$5000 and $10,000, or 4.3 per cent to just over 9 per cent. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at US$89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at US$109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut US prices nearly 20 per cent on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6 per cent.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company has higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble.\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down\".\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year unless the US economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8 per cent.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are ageing, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early next month.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.",

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "title": "Tesla price cuts: Flagging demand or tactic to boost sales?",
                    "body": "DETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nPositive Cases Among Kern Residents: 310,095\n\nDeaths: 2,622\n\nRecovered and Presumed Recovered Residents: 305,002\n\nPercentage of all cases that are unvaccinated: 71\n\nPercentage of all hospitalizations that are unvaccinated: 83.13\n\nSource: Kern County Public Health Services Department\n\nUpdated: 3/2/23\n\nMore Coronavirus coverage",

                    "body": "DETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nSubscribe Get Unlimited Access $3 for 3 Months Subscribe Now\n\nSupport local journalism reporting on your community\n\n* New Subscribers Only\n\n* Digital Subscription Only\n\nAfter the initial selected subscription period your subscription rate will auto renew at $12.00 per month.",

It's amazing how far ahead they are,' CoPilot Founder and CEO tells Yahoo Finance. Ryan says Tesla is able to accomplish this - and its competitors cannot - because 'Tesla basically went through the growing pains of learning how to build EVs sufficiently earlier and got through that gives them the margin advantage...they can afford to cut their prices and still be profitable.'\n\nAccording to Ryan, several of Tesla's EV competitors are facing significant challenges - Ford (F) when it comes to profitability on its EV sales, and Rivian (RIVN) and Polestar (PSNY) on their decision to not cut prices on its vehicles.\n\nRyan also advises used car shoppers on timing their next purchase, outlining some of the biggest challenges right now and explaining why buying waiting one to three months could yield greater benefits.",

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "title": "Tesla price cuts: Flagging demand or tactic to boost sales?",
                    "body": "FILE - A sign marks the entrance to the Tesla Gigafactory, Oct. 13, 2018, in Sparks, Nev. Tesla will get more than $330 million in tax breaks from Nevada to massively expand its vehicle battery facility east of Reno and add a new electric semi-truck factory. Approval on Thursday, March 2, 2023, from the Governor's Office of Economic Development came as Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo cited the benefit of jobs and the boost that Tesla's huge Gigafactory has given the local economy for almost a decade.\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.",

                    "body": "Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have been on fire this year. Despite a recent pullback, TSLA stock is up more than 70% so far in 2023. From the recent low, shares are up more than 80% as well.\n\nOf course, such a big rally does create a bit of concern about future gains over the next 12 months. But some would argue that shares can go even higher.\n\nAfter six straight weekly gains at one point this year, TSLA stock has struggled over the last few weeks. Shares fell 5.5% two weeks ago and eked out a gain of just 0.46% last week. Although the stock held up nicely during the market dip, last week's gain also underperformed the broader market. The S&P 500 climbed about 2% over the same period.\n\nIn any regard, shares of Tesla are down slightly on Monday as price adjustments make headlines -- again. No other automaker seems to command this much interest around price changes for its vehicles. Whenever Tesla changes its prices, however, it's front-page news.\n\nSo, what's the latest? The electric vehicle (EV) maker will reportedly reduce its U.S. prices for the Model S and Model X by between 4% and 9%. Tesla has been cutting prices lately in an effort to help boost demand.\n\nAt the company's recent Investor Day event, CEO Elon Musk said, \"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nAt one point, TSLA stock went through a brutal stretch. Shares fell in five straight months, shedding two-thirds of their value from the August high to the January low.\n\nIs the worst over now?\n\nAfter Tesla's recent rally and subsequent consolidation, many bulls are praying that is the case. However, some actually expect even more upside.\n\nOn Monday, Jefferies analysts reiterated their \"buy\" rating on TSLA stock and raised their price target from $180 per share to $230. That implies about 18% upside from current levels. If achieved, this would give the stock a year-to-date (YTD) gain of about 87%. It would also equate to a more than 120% rally from the 2023 low.\n\nAccording to Jefferies analysts:\n\n\"Lack of new product unveil does not imply major growth delays in our view. Scaling up 3/Y further through dynamic pricing could limit the scope for earnings surprises in 2023/24 but benefit FCF and ROIC.\"\n\nGiven the recent trend in TSLA stock, it's not a stretch to think that $230 could be in the cards this year. However, Tesla will likely need the overall market to cooperate as well. If the S&P 500 rolls over and falls hard, it may be difficult for the stock to hold up in that kind of environment. The same can be said if we slip into a recession, as recessions do not typically bode well for automakers.",

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Along with more camera ports available in an effort to support Tesla's vision of a camera-based and vision-focused self-driving quest, Tesla also seemed to reintroduce radar and a radar heater, which were both seen within the coding of the vehicle.\n\nTesla's new self-driving computer (HW4): more cameras, radar, and more\n\nUnfortunately, Clinton said his vehicle is still in the process of being fully functional, and visualizations are currently broken except for lanes. He stated that a service appointment is set up for this week to fix several features and issues with the vehicle, including several Full Self-Driving suite options, including Autopark, Summon, and Navigate on Autopilot.\n\nInitially, camera quality does not appear to be much different than previously. A few videos uploaded by Clinton show the quality, but there is not a huge improvement, some others agreed.\n\nTesla seems to be planning to implement HW4 in Model S and Model X vehicles initially. Model 3 and Model Y vehicles could have HW4 soon, as both vehicles are currently in the process of being revamped and refreshed by Tesla.\n\nI'd love to hear from you!

                    "body": "SUBSCRIBE: $1 for 3 months By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "By TOM KRISHER - AP Auto Writer\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "DETROIT (AP) -- In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.",

                    "body": "DETROIT - In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.\n\nOn one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.\n\nOn the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid \"performance\" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.\n\nIt was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla slashed prices on several versions of its EVs, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.\n\nThe company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble\n\n\"This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants\" into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that \"you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.\"\n\nGoldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.\n\nSales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.\n\nAbuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April.\n\nThe latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.\n\nThough Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.\n\n\"Under the skin there are a lot of differences\" in the Teslas, he said. \"Customers don't really see those differences.\"\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" Musk asserted. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIn January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.",

                    "body": "Tesla slashed prices on two of its most expensive U.S. models, as it continues the trend of discounting its vehicles to drive up demand.\n\nDays after CEO Elon Musk spoke at Tesla's Investor Day praising price cuts to other models and their effect on demand, the company discounted two of its higher-priced vehicles -- the Model S and Model X.\n\nStarting at $99,990, Tesla's premier Model X will see a striking 9% reduction, while its Model S will now start at $89,990, a 5% discount. Both models offer lines with expanded all-wheel drive (AWD) as well, with Tesla discounting the Model X AWD by nearly $10,000 and the Model S AWD by around $5,000, according to its website.\n\nTesla also offers a premium \"Plaid\" version of its Model S and Model X series, featuring base AWD and increased acceleration. Plaid buyers will see price tags as low as $109,990, marking a 4% discount.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at the annual conference.\n\nThe price cut is Tesla's fifth pricing change in 2023, notably cutting prices by as much as 20% across all models in January. That sale made many Tesla vehicles eligible for Biden's $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, further incentivizing demand.\n\nMany view Tesla's recent spurt of price cuts as the beginnings of an EV pricing war, as the longtime market leader feels its presence threatened by the explosion of automakers developing their own gas alternative models.\n\n\"The price cuts Tesla has already implemented globally has catalyzed demand by 30% out of the gates as this latest price cut is another smart move,\" Wedbush Securities managing director of equities Dan Ives told CNBC. \"This is an EV arms race playing out and Tesla has the margins to make price cuts and still be well above other automakers.\"\n\nMusk has been adamant about driving up demand for his vehicles, especially following reaction to last week's Investor Day. Despite Musk's enticing vision for the long-term outlook of the company, the short-term has left many investors weary as the competition begins to heat up.",

The cuts follow another price reduction in January that took as much as 20% off the starting price.\n\nCEO Elon Musk noted last week that lowering prices has helped drive interest in the vehicles.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand,\" Musk said during the company's investor day.\n\nA request for comment sent to Tesla's email account for press bounced back with a message saying the inbox was full.\n\nTesla's Model S dropped 5% to $89,990, while its Model X dropped 9% to $99,990, according to the company's website.\n\nThe price for the performance versions of both vehicles also fell, with the Model S Plaid dropping 4% to $109,990 and the Model X Plaid dropping 8% to $109,990.\n\nHere are the current prices for Tesla's vehicles:\n\nTesla said it's working to cut the cost of its next generation of vehicles in half. The company has yet to unveil the upcoming vehicles and said details would come at a later date.\n\n\"Affordability is what matters,\" Musk said during investor day. \"As you make the car more affordable, we'll have demand go crazy.\"",

                    "body": "It can be hard to keep track of how expensive Tesla EVs are lately since the company has adjusted the prices so many times in the last few months. As recently as January, Tesla dropped its Model Y mid-size SUV to $52,990, representing a nearly 20 percent discount. While that's been the most significant price reduction, it certainly hasn't been the only one.\n\nTesla is still the dominant force in the EV market, but it's facing a lot more competition when compared to its early days. It now has to go against the likes of burgeoning EV models from other legacy car brands, like BMW or Hyundai. Instead of Tesla being the only EVs on the market and being able to dictate how they should be priced, it now has to consider how its lines up with other competitive EV options.\n\nThe latest price cuts target the starting prices of Tesla's higher-end models, dropping the Model S from $94,990 to $89,990 and reducing the Model X from $109,990 to $99,990. Tesla also reduced the performance variants of both models, dropping both the Model S Plaid and Model X Plaid to $109,990.\n\nTesla's strategy of lowering prices could be interpreted as a way to drive up demand. However, Tesla's many rounds of price reductions have also stoked a price war among EV makers looking to get a foothold in the U.S. market and beyond. Tesla has also had to adjust its prices in China, where it's facing competition with major players like BYD.\n\nAnother major reason behind Tesla's Model Y price cut comes from the changes to the federal tax credits for EVs. With the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the EV you buy must fall below an $80,000 price tag if it's a van, SUV, or pickup truck, and below $55,000 for other vehicles. This change to the federal tax credit can be clearly seen in how Tesla dropped its Model Y crossover to a starting price of $52,990.\n\nIt feels like we're still in the early stages of this price war amongst EV makers, so we can likely expect more market adjustments. However, Tesla may have an upper hand here as it can use its market dominance as leverage in this ongoing price battle. Considering Tesla has several best-selling models in the U.S., it has more leeway to reduce prices across the board as a way to drum up more demand.\n\nWe're already seeing the pressure affect Ford, who cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E by around $4,500 depending on the trim. All said, a price war is great for the consumers looking to buy a new EV.",

                    "body": "Tesla has lowered the prices of Model S by 5 percent and Model X by 10 percent.\n\nTesla has reduced the prices of its Model S sedan and Model X SUV by $5,000 and $10,000, respectively, in the U.S. The move follows recent price cuts of Tesla's more popular Model 3 and Model Y cars f and CEO Elon Musk assured consumers he wants Tesla EVs to be affordable.\n\nTesla shares fell more than 2 percent today (March 6).\n\nAfter the price drops, the Model S sedan now starts at just below $90,000, about a 5 percent savings. The Model X was discounted 10 percent and starts at just below $100,000, according to Tesla's website. The high-end \"Plaid\" version of the Model S and the Model X now retail at the same price of $109,990, making Model X Plaid a particularly good deal. (Plaid is a reference to the movie Spaceballs).\n\nHere are Tesla's prices for its Model S and Model X:\n\nModel S AWD: $89,990 (from $94,990) Model S Plaid: $109,990 (from $114,990) Model X AWD: $99,990 (from $109,990) Model X Plaid: $109,990 (from $119,990)\n\nNeither vehicle is eligible for the $7,500 electric vehicle federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act because they exceed the retail price caps under the law.\n\nIn December, Tesla slashed prices for the Model Y SUV by 20 percent and the Model 3 sedan by 14 percent. Demand soared in response, causing the Model Y to run out of stock and have a months-long wait list. The company has since reversed some of the cuts.\n\nDuring Tesla's latest quarterly earnings call in January, Musk said Tesla's goal is always to \"make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible.\" On the same call, Zach Kirkhorn, Tesla's chief financial officer, suggested prices will stay low for at least this year with the average price of Tesla cars just above $47,000.\n\nModel S and Model X are Tesla's most expensive electric cars but don't sell well. In 2022, the company sold only 66,705 Model S and Model X vehicles, accounting for 5 percent of its total delivery. The previous year, Model S and Model X cars were less than 3 percent of Tesla's total unit sales.\n\nTesla raised prices across its EV lineups multiple times during the pandemic to cope with rising manufacturing costs and parts shortage. The new discounts only bring Model S and Model X prices near to their early 2021 levels.",

                    "body": "Tesla lowered prices on two of its cars this week as the automaker jockeys for dominance in the electric vehicle market, marking its second price cut this year.\n\nTesla's hatchback, the Model S, now costs $89,990, down from $94,990 a week ago, according to its website. The upgraded Model S Plaid's price fell to $109,990 from $114,990 a week ago. Tesla's mid-sized sedan Model X is now $99,990, down from $109,990 while the price for its Plaid version fell to $109,990 from $119,990.\n\nAutomotive industry experts say affordability is key to driving widespread acceptance of electric vehicles as the U.S. tries to loosen its dependency on fossil fuels as well as gas-powered cars. Charging stations are sprouting up nationwide to encourage consumers to buy electric, but price points will ultimately determine if the vehicles are financially within reach of the middle class, experts said.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment.\n\nThe company, owned by Elon Musk, dropped the price on its Model Y in January in a move that set off a pricing war among EV manufacturers, analysts said. Weeks after Tesla's move, Ford reduced the price on its electric Mustang.\n\nMore price drops likely\n\nTesla prices could fall even further in the near future now that the company is planning a new factory in Mexico, analysts say. The Monterrey facility, along with Tesla's factory in Texas, will focus on building a new powertrain that's cheaper to produce, analysts at Wedbush Securities said in a research note last week.\n\n\"This, in our opinion, will set the stage for a sub-$30k vehicle likely to be introduced in a separate event over the coming year -- with a late 2024 target date our estimate,\" Dan Ives said in the note.\n\nOther analysts said they believe Tesla is dropping prices because of slower demand, pushing the company to prioritize sales volume over profitability.\n\nThe price drops come as Tesla is receiving increased scrutiny on its self-driving feature. Since 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched investigations into 35 separate Tesla crashes, 19 of which were fatal. The federal agency also pressured Tesla into recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles after its self-driving feature failed to follow posted speed limits or stop at intersections.\n\nThe electric vehicle market -- which is expected to reach $1.1 trillion globally by 2030 -- has indeed had its own starts and stops in recent years, ignited by supply-chain woes caused by the pandemic and Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. In 2022, automakers hiked the price of EVs as they struggled to get raw materials for making lithium-ion batteries.\n\nTesla's stock price was down 2.1% Monday afternoon, trading at roughly $194 a share.",

                    "body": "Other automakers could follow amid gloomy profit forecasts.\n\nShares of Tesla fell as much as 2% today after the company reduced U.S. prices of its most expensive models.\n\nTesla cut the prices of its Model S sedan by 5% to $89,990 from $94,990 and its Model X SUV by 9% to $99,990 from $109,990. The company also reduced the upscale Plaid versions of each model to $109,990, down $5,000 and $10,000, respectively.\n\nThe price reductions came days after investors expressed disappointment that Tesla didn't unveil a lower-priced model at its first-ever investor day.\n\nThey also follow cuts of up to 20% on the company's lineup in January, a move aimed at spurring demand that also pushed prices below the threshold needed for buyers to qualify for a new $7,500 federal tax credit on electric cars.\n\nMeanwhile, the decision reflects some moderation in overall new car prices, which have soared over the past two years after stagnating in the 2010s.\n\nTesla appeared on the list of the 10 best-selling U.S. vehicles for the first time in 2022. Sales of its Model Y rose 32% during the year to 252,000, ranking sixth.\n\nThe average sales price for Tesla vehicles has declined by about half in the past five years, primarily because its less expensive Models 3 and Y now account for 95% of sales. Tesla delivered 1.31 million new cars last year, 40% higher than the previous year but 900,000 shy of its goal.\n\nNonetheless, the company has targeted sales of 1.8 million this year, with the latest cuts aimed at meeting that goal.\n\nTesla's price trends in recent years have moved in the opposite direction of the rest of the U.S. auto industry.\n\nSupply-chain disruptions and pent-up demand from the Covid-19 pandemic left automakers with inventory shortages in 2021. In the past two years, U.S. new car prices surged 19%.\n\nHowever, analysts warn that high prices soon may turn away prospective buyers.\n\nThe average monthly payment on new cars in the U.S. has increased to $777, compared with about $400 in 2019. At the same time, U.S. and European automakers expect profit for 2023 to be about half of last year.\n\n\"Auto sentiment is very poor,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note to investors late last year. \"We get it. Higher (interest) rates, still high prices, low consumer confidence, a potential recession and European energy risk does not make autos a friendly place.\"\n\nPerhaps heeding that warning, automakers have started to adjust. The average U.S. new car price fell 0.4% in January to $49,388 after reaching a record high in December. But it remained 5.9% higher than the same month a year ago.",

                    "body": "\u00a9 Marc Urbano - Car and Driver Pricing on the Model S trims dropped by $5000, while pricing for the Model X trims dropped by roughly $10,000. Tesla has again issued significant markdowns, this time cutting prices of the 2023 Model S and '23 Model X by $5000 and $10,000, respectively. The Model X now starts at $101,380, and the Model S starts at $91,380; Plaid versions of each now start at $111,380. Earlier this year, Tesla slashed prices for the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV.\n\nIf yesterday you bought either a Tesla Model S or Model X at full price, you might not be too happy to read this: Tesla has once again introduced significant price cuts. The latest move sees the starting prices of the 2023 Model S and '23 Model X drop by roughly $5000 and $10,000, respectively.\n\nModel S and X Markdowns\n\nThe Model S now starts at $91,380 -- down from $96,630. The Model X now starts at $101,380 -- down from $111,630. The high-performance Plaid versions of each now start at $111,380. Previously, they started at $116,630 (Model S) and $121,630 (Model X).\n\nThat brings the price of the Model S down by around 4 percent; the Model X's price is down by about 9 percent. Even with the most recent price cuts, the Model S and Model X are Tesla's two most expensive vehicles by a considerable margin.\n\nThis marks the second time this year Tesla has implemented large markdowns for its most expensive models, with both the Model S and Model X having their prices dropped by roughly $10,000 in January.\n\nFrequent Price Fluctuations\n\nThe latest price changes also represent Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year, as reported by Reuters. The largest reduction came in January when the company reduced the price of the Model Y by $13,000 in order to bring it below the $55,000 maximum price allowed under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), helping it qualify for the federal tax credit.\n\nThe constant price changes and updates are enough to confuse even the most clued-in customers. Earlier this year, when surprise price cuts hit China, customers who recently purchased a new Tesla were angered by the devaluation of their vehicles. Hundreds of protesters gathered at Tesla stores and chanted \"Return the money, refund our cars.\" in a video that was also reported by Reuters.\n\nThere are currently no reports of Tesla offering refunds following the January price cuts. That suggests it's unlikely Tesla will offer any for owners who recently purchased either vehicle affected by the latest markdowns.\n\nLooking to purchase a car?

                    "body": "By William Johnson Posted on March 6, 2023\n\nThe Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X are among the recipients of the Kelley Blue Book \"Best Resale Value\" award for 2023.\n\nA common trait among the hot new electric vehicles currently on sale is their incredible resale values. Vehicles like the Rivian R1T, GMC Hummer EV, and Ford F-150 Lightning have become appreciating assets over the past few years. However, no brand has been more synonymously tied to \"flippers\" than Tesla vehicles, and that has been seen today as the Tesla Model S and X took home the KBB's \"Best Resale Value\" award for their respective classes.\n\nIn total, KBB awarded 28 vehicles its \"Best Resale Value\" award, \"recognizing vehicles for their projected retained value through the initial five-year ownership period.\"\n\nThe Tesla Model S was recognized as the top of the luxury electric car segment, while the Tesla Model X took the top of the luxury electric SUV segment. Other EV winners include the Chevy Bolt, which topped the electric car segment; the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which topped the electric SUV segment; and the Ford F-150 Lightning, which topped the electric truck segment.\n\nNo electric vehicles were recognized within the KBB's top 10, with most of those vehicles coming from Japanese automakers and most being non-electrified models.\n\nBroadly, Toyota and Lexus were awarded the best resale value brands of 2023, winning many segments, including the minivan, PHEV, full-size pickup truck, midsize pickup truck, and luxury full-size SUV.\n\nWhile some may be surprised at the absence of the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, it should be noted that both vehicles have seen substantial drops in value following the automaker's price cut earlier this year, bringing some used Model 3s to the lowest prices ever seen.\n\nMore shocking is the lack of vehicles like the Rivian R1T and R1S, Hyundai IONIQ 5, or the Kia EV6, especially considering the demand surrounding each vehicle in their respective segments.\n\nWith the KBB creating new segments for electric vehicles, many wonder when EVs will be recognized as better resale value vehicles over gas counterparts. And with a growing number of offerings from more and more brands, that day may be sooner than we anticipate.\n\nWhat do you think of the article? Do you have any comments, questions, or concerns?

Tesla announced significant price increases for many of its vehicles in 2021 and 2022 in the face of parts shortages and long waiting lists, only to reverse course in January this year as weaker demand and rising competition ate into sales. The starting price of its Model X jumped from around $99,000 to over $120,000 last year, helping to support Tesla's industry-leading profit margins but contributing to disappointing new vehicle deliveries in the final months of 2022.",

They are now both priced at $111,380. Previously, the Model S Plaid started at $116,630 and the Model X Plaid at $121,630.\n\nThe latest price cuts come just days after CEO Elon Musk said during an investor presentation that previous price cuts were helping to boost demand.\n\nTesla is not alone in cutting prices of its EVs. Shortly after Tesla cut prices in January, Ford responded with price cuts for the Mustang Mach-E.\n\nTesla is by far the largest EV company, even prior to announcing its recent discounts. It reported approximately 1.3 million EV sales in 2022, which was up 40% on the previous year and well ahead of BYD in second place with approximately 900,000 sales.\n\nIt should be noted that even with the latest price cuts, the starting prices of the Model S and Model X are still higher than what they were just two years ago.",

                    "body": "Tesla Inc. reduced prices of its more expensive models again, days after Elon Musk said cuts earlier this year had piqued interest in the company's electric vehicles.\n\nThe Model S and X now start at $89,990 and $99,990 in the U.S., down a respective 5.3% and 9.1%, according to Tesla's website. The company lowered prices of the higher-performance Plaid versions of each vehicle by 4.3% and 8.3%.\n\nAt $109,990, Plaid iterations of the S and X now cost $26,000 and $29,000 less than they did in early January.\n\nMusk said last week that desire to own Teslas was \"indistinguishable from infinite,\" and that demand will \"go crazy\" as the company makes its cars more affordable. Reducing prices of S and the X models again suggests those vehicles may have gotten less of a boost from cuts the company made across its lineup seven weeks ago.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" Musk said during Tesla's March 1 investor day.\n\nTesla shares fell 0.8% as of 9:55 a.m. New York time Monday. The stock has climbed 61% this year after plunging 65% in 2022.\n\nThe Model S and X were just over 5% of Tesla's vehicle deliveries last year, so changing their pricing will have less of an effect on the company's bottom line and EV market dynamics than adjusting the cost of higher-volume vehicles. Still, the cuts are consistent with comments Musk and other executives made last week about squeezing expense out of how it designs, engineers and manufactures vehicles in order to unlock more demand.\n\n\"Tesla is sprinting in a global automotive marathon to cut costs, as they strive to be a global manufacturing champion that can give the company a sustainable competitive advantage,\" said Joel Levington, a Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst.\n\nTesla's dynamic pricing is unique in the automotive world, where manufacturers typically only make changes to what they suggest their retailers charge from one model year to the next. Reductions to the Model 3 and Y in January made those vehicles cheaper relative to the average price of a new vehicle in the U.S. than ever before.\n\nThe changes to the 3 and Y were at least in part driven by Tesla wanting those models to qualify for tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act. After the Biden administration changed how it distinguished between passenger cars and sport utility vehicles in early February, thereby raising the price limit for Model Ys to be eligible for credits, Tesla bumped prices back up.",

                    "body": "We'll send you a myFT Daily Digest email rounding up the latest Automobiles news every morning.\n\nTesla has cut the prices of its most expensive models in the US for a second time this year, further unravelling earlier steep price increases that had contributed to a slump in demand in 2022.\n\nThe starting price of the Model S has been reduced 5 per cent to $89,990 while the cost of the lowest-priced Model X has come down 9 per cent to $99,990, according to the company's website.\n\nTesla announced significant price increases for many of its vehicles in 2021 and 2022 in the face of parts shortages and long waiting lists, only to reverse course in January this year as weaker demand and rising competition ate into sales.\n\nThe starting price of its Model X jumped from around $99,000 to over $120,000 last year, helping to support Tesla's industry-leading profit margins but contributing to disappointing new vehicle deliveries in the final months of 2022.\n\nChief executive Elon Musk said last week that a round of price cuts in January across all markets and most of Tesla's models had an immediate impact in stoking higher sales. Tom Zhu, head of Tesla China and the executive responsible for the company's global manufacturing plants, also said the price cuts had led to an increase in market share in China, where Tesla has faced a barrage of new competition.\n\nSpeaking at Tesla's first investor day, Musk claimed that demand for Tesla's vehicles was \"infinite\" and that the only thing holding buyers back was affordability, though he did not address the impact his company's earlier round of price increases had on dampening sales.\n\nTesla's stock price slipped more than 2 per cent on Monday, but Wall Street has welcomed Musk's aggressive moves to cut prices to defend sales this year, even at the risk of eating into profitability. The shares have risen 80 per cent since the start of the year on hopes that Tesla will be able to take market share from rivals that are already struggling to make profits from electric vehicle sales.\n\nMusk shone a spotlight last week on the many actions Tesla has been taking across its operations to lower costs while still improving the performance of its vehicles. The moves should enable it to cut the costs of manufacturing its next generation of electric vehicles by 50 per cent, he claimed, raising hopes for a new, lower-priced electric vehicle that will help Tesla fend off growing competition.",

                    "body": "Tesla has slashed prices for its electric cars -- again -- as it tries to boost sales and compete with rivals.\n\nCutbacks - worth several thousand pounds, depending on market and model - have been listed for sale on the company's website in recent days in the UK, US and elsewhere.\n\nThey follow big markdowns of up to 20% that the company introduced in January.\n\nTesla faces challenges as higher borrowing costs weigh on buyers and rivals offer more electric options.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment. Last year, the company missed its 2022 target of increasing its deliveries by 50% annually, a shortfall it blamed on supply constraints and a weak economy.\n\nBut boss Elon Musk has previously said the price cuts are working to boost demand.\n\n\"People's desire to own a Tesla is very high. Their ability to pay for a Tesla is their limiting factor,\" Mr Musk said during a presentation to investors last week.\n\nMr Musk warned in January that a \"pretty tough recession\" would hit demand this year, leading to a contraction in the wider industry.\n\nMr Musk said he expects Tesla sales to continue to grow, given the company's focus on pricing.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the latest round of cuts marks Tesla's fifth price change since earlier this year, when its markdowns rocked the electric car market, prompting some other companies to cut prices in response.\n\nTesla has raised some prices for some models in some countries, but the costs are less than those.\n\nIn the U.S., the latest discounts range from 4% to 9% and apply to the company's priciest vehicles, the Model S, its sports car, and the Model X, a midsize sport utility vehicle.\n\nIn Europe and the UK, the trims listed on the website apply to the Model 3 Sedan and Model Y. For example, the Model 3 versions are priced around 6% down from \u00a360,090 to \u00a356,540.\n\nTesla's lead in the electric car market has been challenged by increased competition from traditional automakers such as Ford and General Motors, as well as new entrants such as Rivian and Lucid in the US and BYD and Neo in China.",

                    "body": "By Joey Klender Posted on March 6, 2023\n\nTesla cut prices again this morning, and competitors, who have decided to either take the same strategy by slashing prices themselves or have chosen not to play into Elon Musk's game, are in a weird and awkward position.\n\nTesla Model S and Model X units were the most recent vehicles in the automaker's lineup to receive price cuts. While these vehicles only make up roughly 5 percent of Tesla's overall sales volume based on last year's sales figures, the price cuts give automakers with competing models another thing to think about.\n\nTesla Model X and Model S get price reduction in the United States\n\nFor startups, there are few that can even think about cutting costs at this point. Companies like Rivian, Lucid, and Lordstown are unable to shave prices currently and at the drop of a hat like Tesla. Every dollar and every sale right now counts, and there is not much wiggle room.\n\nFor traditional companies, the wiggle room on pricing for EVs is also extremely small. Ford, for example, while announcing plans to increase production of popular EV models this weekend, is still struggling with availability.\n\nIf you went to a Ford, GM, or other legacy dealership right now and tried to order a car, it might be extremely difficult, and people who just bought cars don't want to see that their vehicle was just subjected to a price cut of thousands of dollars. When Ford cut Mustang Mach-E prices earlier this year, owners who took delivery just before the decreases were not pleased, and the automaker couldn't do much to appease them.\n\nTesla's strengths are plentiful, and they expand across nearly every part of its business. Its charging infrastructure is strong, the company can get you a car in a matter of a few weeks, and its pricing can be adjusted at any moment.\n\nIf it needs to adjust prices to make margins a little more appealing to investors and analysts, it can. If it needs to spike demand with a dramatic cut like it did this morning, it can do that too. It's not a perfect company, though. Service and Customer Communications for Tesla are incredibly weak; it is one of the most publicly-criticized portions of the company. Despite that, people continue to buy Teslas in droves.\n\nWith another Tesla price cut, companies are in a serious pickle. Tesla could decide in a week to cut prices again, making consumers more prone to choose their product over another. The advantages go past price, but what that number says is the first thing consumers look at when considering a vehicle. The lower they get, the more attractive they become to consumers.\n\nWhy Tesla dropped the prices of the Model S and Model X is unknown, but Gary Black seems to believe the move is to encourage more sales of the flagship vehicles, which, as previously mentioned, do not contribute to the company's overall sales volume very much.\n\nHowever, there are other things: Model X vehicles are being equipped with the new Hardware 4 computer, Tesla has tried to get Free Supercharging-equipped cars off the roads, and it could be another way to push sales upward.\n\nWhatever the reasoning is, Tesla put competitors in another weird spot. With the constant price changes that occurred earlier this year, there was already doubt in place about what competitors could do to remain competitive. The most recent adjustment in prices makes things even more difficult and reminds everyone that Tesla is ultimately the king of the hill.\n\nDisclosure: Joey Klender is a Tesla Shareholder.\n\nI'd love to hear from you!

Both models offer lines with expanded all-wheel drive (AWD) as well, with Tesla discounting the Model X AWD by nearly $10,000 and the Model S AWD by around $5,000, according to its website.\n\nTesla also offers a premium \"Plaid\" version of its Model S and Model X series, featuring base AWD and increased acceleration. Plaid buyers will see price tags as low as $109,990, marking a 4% discount.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at the annual conference.\n\nThe price cut is Tesla's fifth pricing change in 2023, notably cutting prices by as much as 20% across all models in January. That sale made many Tesla vehicles eligible for Biden's $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, further incentivizing demand.\n\nMany view Tesla's recent spurt of price cuts as the beginnings of an EV pricing war, as the longtime market leader feels its presence threatened by the explosion of automakers developing their own gas alternative models.\n\n\"The price cuts Tesla has already implemented globally has catalyzed demand by 30% out of the gates as this latest price cut is another smart move,\" Wedbush Securities managing director of equities Dan Ives told CNBC. \"This is an EV arms race playing out and Tesla has the margins to make price cuts and still be well above other automakers.\"\n\nMusk has been adamant about driving up demand for his vehicles, especially following reaction to last week's Investor Day. Despite Musk's enticing vision for the long-term outlook of the company, the short-term has left many investors weary as the competition begins to heat up.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n10 Largest, Most Valuable Brands In The World 2023 Biden's Clean Energy Factory Jobs May Elude US Union Workers",

The company slashed prices for vehicles across all categories back in January, with some models receiving an up to 20 percent price cut.\n\nIn January, due to the price cut, the Tesla Model 3 RWD finally qualified for the $5,000 CAD federal iZEV rebate, since the vehicle's price had dropped below the $55,000 CAD limit.\n\nNow, the Austin, Texas-based company is delivering another range of price cuts, most of which are applicable in the United States, with only the Model X receiving a reduction in Canada.\n\nAs shared by TeslaNorth, the Model S received a $5,000 USD price cut in the U.S. on both, the Long Range and Plaid models, while the Model X saw a $10,000 USD drop on its Long Range and Plaid models. Before the price cut, the Long Range Model S was $94,990 USD (now $89,990 USD), and the Plaid Model S was $114,990 USD (now $109,990 USD). Similarly, before the price cut, the Long Range Model X was $109,990 USD (now $99,990 USD), and the Plaid Model X was $119,990 USD (now $109,990 USD).\n\nAs mentioned above, only the Model X saw a price drop in Canada. The Model X Long Range saw a $7,000 CAD price drop to $135,990 CAD from $142,990 CAD. Similarly, the Model X Plaid got a $7,000 CAD cut, going from $156,990 CAD to $149,990 CAD.\n\nFor reference, at the beginning of the year, the Model X Long Range was $157,990, while the Model X Plaid was $156,990.",

                    "body": "Cuts range from 4% on performance version of Model S to 9% on more expensive Model X\n\nTesla has cut prices on its two most expensive electric vehicles in the United States, according to the company's website, days after its chief executive, Elon Musk, said recent price cuts on other models had stoked demand.\n\nThe price cuts, Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year, ranged from 4% on the performance version of the Model S to 9% on the more expensive Model X.\n\nMusk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the most recent price cuts.\n\nTesla slashed prices on its cars across all its markets in January, offering discounts of up to 20% in what many analysts saw as the start of a price war by the electric vehicle market leader.\n\nIt has been adjusting prices since with a pace and frequency that goes beyond what established automaker's have attempted in an industry where a car's base price is still referred to as a \"sticker price\" on a vehicle in inventory.\n\nThe Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance \"Plaid\" editions, represented about 4% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. Its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, made up the rest.\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.\n\nTesla has a new version of the Model 3 codenamed \"Highland\" scheduled to go into production later this year and a change to the Model Y codenamed \"Juniper\" for next year, Reuters has reported.",

                    "body": "VW's Scout electric SUV brand comes out and teases its first model, due in 2026. SUVs are fueling global oil demand, and electric SUVs aren't solving it. Mercedes readies its eSprinter for more range and a wide range of uses. And Tesla cuts prices again. This and more, here at Green Car Reports.\n\nTesla has once again cut prices on the Model S and Model X. With these cuts of $5,000 to $10,000, Tesla is now effectively bringing the Dual Motor Model S just below the price of the dual-motor Lucid Air Pure that beats the equivalent Model S in range. It's also bringing Plaid versions of the Model S and Model X to their lowest prices yet -- both to the same $111,380.\n\nMercedes-Benz has made efficiency and flexibility core focal points for the new generation of eSprinter electric vans recently revealed. With LFP battery packs, heat-pump tech, and modular propulsion systems, these vans will be ready for a range of upfits, if not the Vanlife quite yet.\n\nScout Motors, the new electric vehicle brand from Volkswagen, on Friday confirmed that its first model will be an SUV in the $40,000 range, built at a new $2 billion factory in South Carolina. That model won't arrive until 2026, but it will be followed by a larger electric pickup truck.\n\nAnd whether it's the price of fashion or practicality: SUVs are fueling global oil demand and fouling CO2 targets, while neither electric SUVs nor electric vehicles as a whole are doing enough to offset that, according to a new analysis from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Downsized vehicles with smaller batteries, battery swapping, and other tech advances might though.",

                    "body": "Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian joins the Live show to discuss Tesla's recent round of price cuts.\n\n- Welcome back. Tesla slashing prices in the US again. The EV maker posted a further price reduction on its website for its higher end Model X, and also, the Model S after previously lowering prices in January. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian joins us now. So Pras, kind of a kick toward the competition here. They want to keep up their revenue targets, their growth targets, I would imagine, lower prices. What does this mean for Tesla?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, you know, with these top end Model S and Model X vehicles, they've been sort of calibrating it, cutting it, raising prices a little bit, cutting again. You actually have pretty decent price cuts here for both those cars. So the Model S sedan, you're going to see that drop by as much as 5% for the base range model there, and then the Plaid goes down about 4% to $110,000.\n\nSo you can get that Model S regular for $90,000. You see the Model X SUVs there. That base version now at $99,900 and that Plaid at $110,000, so that's a 9% to 8% drop there. So that's a pretty significant drop there for those cars. Now, they don't really qualify for that IRA tax credit, because they're above the price range for that.\n\nSo that's a little kind of nice, little thing there for owners who are buyers of those high end cars. And it helps to compete against the Porsche Taycan's of the world, the Mercedes EQS' of the world, and the upcoming BMW i7's. So I think it's a nice way to kind of gin up demand. Musk said himself that there are enough people there to buy Tesla's. There's just not enough money to buy them, so to speak, he said, in some sense.\n\n- I'm so curious, though, because it makes sense if they're cutting the prices of the lower tier vehicles. At this price point, like how price sensitive is somebody who's buying a $100,000 car? Like does it matter? An 8% difference, is that, that big of a swing? I don't know.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean, I think 10%, that's your sales tax, right? That's, in my opinion, a pretty big cut in terms of, look, the competition is heating up at that high end, right? Like I said, the Mercedes EQS and the Lucid Air is at that level too.\n\nSo those are some actual cars that will compete nicely with the Model S and Model X, so I think that's why they want to-- they're seeing that those demand drivers working at the lower end, you know? Risk people aren't immune to price cuts, right? They're going to want to-- they don't want to pay money if they don't have to.\n\n- Economics happens at the margins, at the edges. That's what they say.",

                    "title": "Tesla Model S and Model X prices cut again by up to $10,000",
                    "body": "Over the weekend, Tesla again cut prices on its Model S sedan and Model X SUV.\n\nThe company already lopped $10,000 off the price of the Model S in January, as part of sweeping price cuts across the entire lineup; now it's cut another $5,000. With this, an even greater cut applies to Model X prices; they're now $10,000 lower than they were last week.\n\nAs they are Monday, the Model S starts at $91,380, including the mandatory $1,390 destination fee. That's for the Dual Motor version offering a 405-mile EPA range and claimed 0-60 mph time of 3.1 seconds. The Dual Motor version of the Model X starts at $101,380 in five-passenger form, while six- and seven-passenger versions are available at extra cost.\n\nThese prices, while much lower than they were last year, remain far higher than in late 2020, when the company dropped prices on the Model S in an apparent effort to match the Lucid Air. Both models have since hiked prices; the Air starts at $94,400 in its dual-motor Pure version, rated at 410 miles of range.\n\nAlso of note: The top-performance Tesla Model S Plaid and Model X Plaid both now start at the same price -- $111,380. Tesla claims that the Model S Plaid, with a 396-mile range rating, remains the quickest accelerating car in production today (0-60 mph time of 1.99 seconds and quarter-mile time of 9.23 seconds), while the Model X Plaid achieves a 333-mile range rating and is claimed to be the quickest-accelerating SUV in production today. Both Plaid models have a tri-motor, 1,020-horsepower propulsion system, plus upgraded brake pads and a carbon-fiber spoiler.\n\nTesla continues to offer its $15,000 Full Self-Driving package -- now labeled Full Self-Driving Capability -- on both of these models. Up until now that has included the Full Self-Driving Beta system allowing Autosteer on City Streets, but last month the company issued a recall on that system after federal regulators said that it poses \"an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety.\"\n\nTesla hasn't yet delivered the required firmware update to vehicles, and it's reportedly halted new software installations of Full Self-Driving beta software ahead of the update.\n\nThe move could wreak further havoc on the used Tesla market -- or help make used Teslas more affordable, depending on your outlook. Amid signs that the Tesla demand bubble had burst, used Tesla prices were already dropping in the later half of 2022 before the January price cuts, and prior to those Tesla offered a discount on the Model 3 and Model Y of up to $7,500.\n\nAt Tesla's Investor Day last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk batted back the possibility that the market may be getting tighter, quipping that demand is \"indistinguishable from infinite.\"\n\nHowever Tesla might want to see this, the price cut represents how competitive -- and crowded -- the premium EV field has become, with entries from Rivian, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Cadillac, and others gaining EV market share.",

                    "body": "Automotive and clean energy company Tesla has slashed the prices of its Model X and Model Y in the U.S, as it seeks to boost demand.\n\nThe Model S AWD has been reduced to $89,990 from $94,990. The Model S plaid has been reduced to $109,990 from $114,990. The Model X AWD has been reduced to $99,990 from $109,000 and the Model X Plaid has been reduced to $109,990, from $119,990. The latest discount is Tesla's fifth since the start of the year.\n\nThe new price updates which are already reflected on the company's website and social media handles comes days after the CEO Elon Musk disclosed plans to increase production at Tesla's Shanghai facility in China, in order to meet the soaring demand caused by the previous cuts.\n\nJoin Tekedia Capital Syndicate and own a piece of Africa's finest startups.

In January the EV automaker reduced the prices of its Model Y, Model X, and Model S vehicles to boost demand.\n\nWhile speaking at Tesla's Investor day last week, Musk and other executives at the company discussed the importance of efficient manufacturing and cost-cutting. Musk stated that the desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high, unfortunately, the only limiting factor is their inability to pay for it.\n\nTesla has regularly adjusted the price of its vehicles over the last few years, having previously made increases across its entire range several times between 2021 and 2022. The company's price cuts have been frowned upon by owners who feel cheated.\n\nIn January this year, Hundreds of Tesla owners convened at the automaker's showrooms and distribution centers in China, demanding compensation after the sudden price cuts, which they said meant they had overpaid for electric cars they bought earlier.\n\nMany said they had believed that prices Tesla charged for its cars late last year would not be cut as abruptly or as deeply as the automaker just announced in a move to spur sales and support production at its Shanghai plant. The scheduled expiration of a government subsidy at the end of 2022 also drove many to finalize their purchases.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla reportedly slashed prices in China twice in three months amidst a slow demand for its vehicles. The discount comes at a time when the giant EV maker is struggling to maintain its sales in China, which is its biggest international market.\n\nLast year, Tesla produced more cars than it delivered, which means its inventory has increased. This saw Tesla's stock on Wall Street hit its worst day in two years, dragged down by weaker-than-expected sales data globally. The company's shares ended in 2022 down 65%, greatly cutting into CEO Elon Musk's net worth.\n\nIt is interesting to note that EV competition is increasing domestically in China, with Nio, BYD, Xpeng, and other brands fighting for a smaller pie. Analysts disclose that Tesla needs to further cut prices and expand its sales network in China's lower-tier cities amid aging models.\n\nTesla's prices of the Model 3 and Model Y cars in China, are now 24% to 32% lower than those in the United States.",

                    "body": "Tesla has cut prices for its electric cars - again - as it tries to boost sales and compete with rival firms.\n\nThe reductions - worth several thousand pounds, depending on the market and model - have been listed for sale on the company's website in the UK, US and elsewhere in recent days.\n\nThey follow big markdowns of up to 20% that the firm introduced in January.\n\nTesla is facing challenges as higher borrowing costs weigh on buyers and rivals offer more electric options.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment. Last year, the firm missed its 2022 target of increasing its deliveries by 50% annually, a shortfall the firm blamed on supply strain constraints and a weakening economy.\n\nBut boss Elon Musk has said previously that price cuts were working to lift demand.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Mr Musk said last week during a presentation to investors.\n\nMr Musk warned in January that he expected a \"pretty difficult recession\" to hurt demand this year, leading to a contraction for the wider industry.\n\nMr Musk said he expected Tesla sales to continue to grow, pointing to the firm's focus on price.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the latest round of cuts marks the fifth change Tesla has made to prices since the start of the year, when its markdowns shook up the electric car market, prompting some other firms to slash prices in response.\n\nTesla subsequently raised some prices for some models in some countries, but costs remain lower than they were.\n\nIn the US, the latest discounts range from 4% to 9% and apply to the firm's more expensive vehicles, the Model S, its sports car, and the Model X, mid-size sports utility vehicle.\n\nIn Europe and the UK, the cuts listed on the website apply to the Model 3 sedan and Model Y. In the UK, for example, the cost of versions of the Model 3 drop about 6% to \u00a356,540 from \u00a360,090.\n\nTesla's lead in the electric car market has also been challenged by increased competition from traditional motor manufacturing giants such as Ford and General Motors, as well as newer entrants to the market like Rivian and Lucid in the US and China's BYD and Nio.",

                    "body": "(NEW YORK) -- Electric carmaker Tesla slashed the prices of its two most expensive cars in the U.S., the automaker's website showed on Monday.\n\nThe price cuts affected the performance version of the Model S and the more expensive Model X.\n\nThe move follows a previous cut in January that brought down prices worldwide as much as 20%.\n\nLater that month, CEO Elon Musk said the discounts had significantly boosted car orders following the announcement.\n\n\"Price really matters,\" Musk said on an earnings call. \"I think there's just a vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car but can't afford it.\"\n\nThe move aims to further bolster demand as Tesla faces slowing sales and heightened competition.\n\nAt the outset of this year, Tesla reported disappointing sales for the last three months of 2022, which fell short of Wall Street expectations. Tesla delivered 405,000 vehicles from October through December; analysts anticipated 420,000 deliveries.\n\nThe news sent the company's stock tumbling 12% in a single day.\n\nIn all, Tesla stock has fallen nearly 30% over the past year. Shares fell almost 2% in early trading on Monday after the price cut.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull and managing director of equity research at Wedbush, applauded the price cuts on Monday.\n\n\"Tesla cutting Model S and X prices another smart strategic move by Musk & Co.,\" Ives said on Twitter. \"Lower price points have resonated well and spurred considerable demand.\"\n\nMusk, who acquired Twitter in late October, has drawn scrutiny over his apparent focus on the social media platform. Musk said in December that he would resign as head of Twitter when the company identifies a successor.\n\nPreviously, Musk has attributed Tesla's falling stock price to rising interest rates, which typically hurt stockholders and benefit savers, who stand to gain from an uptick in the interest yielded by accounts held at banks.\n\nThe price cuts mark the third such announcement in recent months. The company said in December that it would offer $7,500 discounts on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered in the U.S. that month.\n\nTesla remains the top seller of EVs in the U.S. but its lead has slipped in recent months as competitors offer a host of affordable alternatives, a S&P Global Mobility report showed in November.\n\nThe company held a 65% market share of newly registered electric vehicles in the U.S. through the third quarter 2022, a drop from 71% in 2021 and 79% in 2020, the report found.\n\n\"It's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible,\" Musk said on the earnings call in January. \"So I think it's a good thing, all things considered.\"",

                    "body": "Tesla, recently, has sparked a bit of a price war in the EV sphere, after cutting prices on some of its cars in January. The strategy may be due to some kind of tax incentive alchemy or simply to induce more demand, since Teslas are no longer the only EV game in town, nor even close to the best. In the past couple days, Tesla has lowered the price of its Model S and Model X, Reuters reports.\n\n\u00a9 Image: Tesla Image: Tesla In case you missed it:Gordon Murray V12, Manual Ferrari 599, MotorWeek Gallardo Retro Review: The Best Automotive Videos on YouTube This WeekWhy Most Car Companies Don't Use Stainless Steel BodiesToyota Celica GT-Four, Chevy Chevelle, Mazda RX-7: The Dopest Cars I Found For Sale Online\n\nThe price cuts will mean nothing to anyone who's not in the market for a Model S or Model X, which is the vast majority of people; those top-tier models made up a mere four percent of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. And yet, for anyone looking for weakness in Tesla, or for any other mildly-curious observer of the EV market, it is telling of something that Tesla thinks it can't sell the Model S and Model X for what it used to. From Reuters:\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.\n\nThe across-the-board discounts are especially surprising given CEO Elon Musk's past comments expressing disgust at the idea of cutting prices. As Torque News reminds us, in 2016, Musk sent a directive to Tesla employees stating, \"There can never -- and I mean never -- be a discount on a new car coming out of the factory in pristine condition.\"\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk doesn't believe in model years, even though Teslas do get updated. But this seems like, too, an admission that the Model S and Model X are what they are, which is, old products.\n\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

According to Tesla's website, the basic version of the Model S now costs $89,990 while the performance model, the Model S Plaid, costs $109,990.\n\nSimilarly, both the performance and basic versions of the Model X prices were cut by $10,000, Reuters reported. The performance model costs $109,990 and the basic model costs $99,990, according to the website.\n\nTesla's current inventory on the website also shows discounted prices on new Model S and Model X cars.\n\nTesla executives announced last week at an investor day presentation that they plan to cut costs of their next-generation cars in half by improving manufacturing and using smaller factories. This cost-cutting measures could bring the price of a Tesla vehicle down to $25,000.\n\n\"As we improve affordability, the number of customers who have access to our products increases,\" Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said during the presentation last week.\n\nTesla did not deliver as many vehicles as they intended to in 2022, producing 1.31 million vehicles last year, short of the 1.4 million deliveries it needed to achieve its goal of a 50 percent increase, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nTesla announced last week that it will be recalling 3,470 2022 and 2023 Model Y electric vehicles due to discovering loose bolts in the cars. Tesla also recalled more than 362,000 vehicles last month, saying that an experimental software could cause crashes.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

                    "body": "Reducing prices of S and the X models again suggests those vehicles may have gotten less of a boost from cuts the company made across its lineup seven weeks ago.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" Musk said during Tesla's March 1 investor day.\n\nTesla shares were 1.2 per cent lower as of 11.33am in New York. The stock has climbed 61 per cent this year after plunging 65 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe Model S and X were just over 5 per cent of Tesla's vehicle deliveries last year, so changing their pricing will have less of an effect on the company's bottom line and EV market dynamics than adjusting the cost of higher-volume vehicles.\n\nStill, the cuts are consistent with comments Musk and other executives made last week about squeezing expense out of how it designs, engineers and manufactures vehicles in order to unlock more demand.\n\n\"Tesla is sprinting in a global automotive marathon to cut costs, as they strive to be a global manufacturing champion that can give the company a sustainable competitive advantage,\" said Joel Levington, a Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst.\n\nTesla's dynamic pricing is unique in the automotive world, where manufacturers typically only make changes to what they suggest their retailers charge from one model year to the next. Reductions to the Model 3 and Y in January made those vehicles cheaper relative to the average price of a new vehicle in the US than ever before.\n\nThe changes to the 3 and Y were at least in part driven by Tesla wanting those models to qualify for tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nAfter the Biden administration changed how it distinguished between passenger cars and sport utility vehicles in early February, thereby raising the price limit for Model Ys to be eligible for credits, Tesla bumped prices back up.",

                    "body": "(NEW YORK) -- Electric carmaker Tesla slashed the prices of its two most expensive cars in the U.S., the automaker's website showed on Monday.\n\nThe price cuts affected the performance version of the Model S and the more expensive Model X.\n\nThe move follows a previous cut in January that brought down prices worldwide as much as 20%.\n\nLater that month, CEO Elon Musk said the discounts had significantly boosted car orders following the announcement.\n\n\"Price really matters,\" Musk said on an earnings call. \"I think there's just a vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car but can't afford it.\"\n\nThe move aims to further bolster demand as Tesla faces slowing sales and heightened competition.\n\nAt the outset of this year, Tesla reported disappointing sales for the last three months of 2022, which fell short of Wall Street expectations. Tesla delivered 405,000 vehicles from October through December; analysts anticipated 420,000 deliveries.\n\nThe news sent the company's stock tumbling 12% in a single day.\n\nIn all, Tesla stock has fallen nearly 30% over the past year. Shares fell almost 2% in early trading on Monday after the price cut.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull and managing director of equity research at Wedbush, applauded the price cuts on Monday.\n\n\"Tesla cutting Model S and X prices another smart strategic move by Musk & Co.,\" Ives said on Twitter. \"Lower price points have resonated well and spurred considerable demand.\"\n\nMusk, who acquired Twitter in late October, has drawn scrutiny over his apparent focus on the social media platform. Musk said in December that he would resign as head of Twitter when the company identifies a successor.\n\nPreviously, Musk has attributed Tesla's falling stock price to rising interest rates, which typically hurt stockholders and benefit savers, who stand to gain from an uptick in the interest yielded by accounts held at banks.\n\nThe price cuts mark the third such announcement in recent months. The company said in December that it would offer $7,500 discounts on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered in the U.S. that month.\n\nTesla remains the top seller of EVs in the U.S. but its lead has slipped in recent months as competitors offer a host of affordable alternatives, a S&P Global Mobility report showed in November.\n\nThe company held a 65% market share of newly registered electric vehicles in the U.S. through the third quarter 2022, a drop from 71% in 2021 and 79% in 2020, the report found.\n\n\"It's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible,\" Musk said on the earnings call in January. \"So I think it's a good thing, all things considered.\"",

                    "body": "Just days after Tesla executives announced plans to improve affordability of their electric cars, Tesla has marked down prices on two of its top end models.\n\nReuters reported that the most recent price cuts are Tesla's fifth time adjusting pricing since the start of the year, with the price drops ranging from four percent on the performance version of the Model S vehicle to nine percent on the Model X vehicle.\n\nReuters reported that Tesla dropped prices of both versions of the Model S by $5,000. According to Tesla's website, the basic version of the Model S now costs $89,990 while the performance model, the Model S Plaid, costs $109,990.\n\nSimilarly, both the performance and basic versions of the Model X prices were cut by $10,000, Reuters reported. The performance model costs $109,990 and the basic model costs $99,990, according to the website.\n\nTesla's current inventory on the website also shows discounted prices on new Model S and Model X cars.\n\nTesla executives announced last week at an investor day presentation that they plan to cut costs of their next-generation cars in half by improving manufacturing and using smaller factories. This cost-cutting measures could bring the price of a Tesla vehicle down to $25,000.\n\n\"As we improve affordability, the number of customers who have access to our products increases,\" Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said during the presentation last week.\n\nTesla did not deliver as many vehicles as they intended to in 2022, producing 1.31 million vehicles last year, short of the 1.4 million deliveries it needed to achieve its goal of a 50 percent increase, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nTesla announced last week that it will be recalling 3,470 2022 and 2023 Model Y electric vehicles due to discovering loose bolts in the cars. Tesla also recalled more than 362,000 vehicles last month, saying that an experimental software could cause crashes.",

                    "body": "Tesla is bringing out its price chopper again, this time at the higher end.\n\nAccording to its website, Tesla has slashed the prices of both its Model S and Model X SUV luxury vehicles. The base version of the Model S drops around 5% to $89,990, and the Plaid performance version drops around 4% to $109,990. As for the Model X SUV, the base long-range version now sits at $99,990, a cut of around 9%, and the Plaid performance version slides 8% to $109,990.\n\nInterestingly the base Model S now sits at around $90,000 for the first time in two years, and the both Plaid versions of the vehicles now start at the same price, of around $110,000. Typically the Model X versions have cost more than the equivalent Model S versions of Tesla's high-end vehicles.\n\nWhile these models don't qualify for the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) tax credits, and are targeting a much more affluent buyer than Tesla's cheaper vehicles, price sensitivity does matter for even for those more well-heeled.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said as much during last week's Investor Day presentation. \"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said.\n\nTesla has been dropping the hammer on pricing boost demand considerably, both here and abroad, and feels it is time to bring those demand levers to the high end -- despite the fact that the Model S and Model X represent only a fraction of the overall sales for the brand. Last quarter Tesla delivered around 17,000 units of the Model S and X globally, whereas it delivered nearly 420,000 Model 3 and Y vehicles in the same time period.\n\nThat being said, price cuts at the highest end shouldn't be a surprise given that the competition is very intense at those lofty levels. The Model S must compete against competition like the Porsche Taycan EV sedan, the Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan, the Lucid Air sedan, and BMW's upcoming range topper, the i7 EV sedan.\n\nAnd looking big picture, Tesla may begin to implement long-term cost savings on the production side to eke out more profit down the line, even at reduced consumer prices. At its investor day, Tesla said it is continually rethinking manufacturing -- it started it with the Model Y, with the battery becoming a structural part of the vehicle floor. Tesla said this type of design cut costs by 50% and reduced factory footprint by 40% -- which will all be part of its upcoming next generation 3 platform design.\n\nTesla may bring (and likely already has in some areas) these design-derived cost improvements to its higher-end cars.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks",

                    "body": "Michael Kern is a newswriter and editor at Safehaven.com and Oilprice.com,\n\nTesla has announced yet another price cut for its high-end electric vehicles in North America, according to the company's website. The move comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that previous price cuts had led to increased demand for more affordable models during an Investor Day event last week.\n\nThe starting prices of Model S and X in the US have been lowered by 5.3% and 9.1%, respectively, to $89,990 and $99,990. The Plaid versions of these models have also been reduced by 4.3% and 8.3%, respectively, with the new cost of $109,990 representing a decrease of $26,000 and $29,000 compared to their January prices.\n\nMusk has claimed that the demand for Teslas is almost limitless and will continue to increase as the company makes its vehicles more affordable. However, the recent price cuts for Model S and X suggest that these particular models may not have experienced the same surge in demand as other vehicles when Tesla reduced prices earlier this year.\n\nLast month, Fred Lambert of Electrek reported that price reductions on Model Y vehicles resulted in \"unprecedented demand\" in the US with the EV crossover selling out entirely until April.\n\nTesla slashed prices on its more affordable cars by up to 20% in January, which allowed buyers to qualify for tax incentives by placing their purchases under a cap of $55,000.\n\nDuring the recent investor day event, Musk addressed the impact of price changes on demand: \"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big.\"\n\nBank of America analyst John Murphy suggests that legacy automakers' thin profit margins or losses related to their lack of scale in EV markets could prompt them to lower their own EV prices following Tesla's recent reductions. This could potentially lead to a price war.\n\nTesla plans to introduce a new version of Model 3 called \"Highland\" later this year while also making styling changes to Model Y referred to as \"Juniper\" set for next year's launch, Reuters reports.",

                    "body": "The big picture: Tesla has lowered the price on its two most expensive EVs in a bid to make its premium models accessible to more buyers. The cuts range from four percent to nine percent, and could signal the start of a price war in the EV industry.\n\nTesla's standard Model S sedan now starts at $89,990 after a five percent price cut of $5,000. Similarly, the Model S Plaid is now $5,000 cheaper and starts at $109,990. The Plaid is a higher-performance version of an already quick EV, boasting an eye-watering 0-60 mph time of 1.99 seconds and a top speed of 200 mph with an EPA estimated range of 396 miles on a single charge.\n\nThe Model X SUV, meanwhile, saw a bigger $10,000 price cut across both variants. The standard model can now be had for $99,990 with the performance-minded Plaid starting at $109,990.\n\nAccording to Reuters, they represent the fifth price adjustment since the start of 2023.\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk hinted that additional price cuts could be in the cards. \"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" he noted.\n\nThe EV maker's stock has been on a roller coaster ride since late last year. In mid-September, shares were trading at just over $300 but by the end of December, the stock had lost about two-thirds of its value and was down to $109. The road to recovery has been slow but steady ever since as shares are flirting with the $200 mark as of this writing.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that while the Model S and Model X are Tesla's higher-end vehicles, they aren't the company's bread and butter. In 2022, Tesla delivered just 66,705 Model S / X vehicles compared to 1,247,146 examples of the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nLooking ahead, Tesla is working on a new version of the Model 3 that's scheduled to enter production later this year. Changes are also in store for the Model Y in 2024 along with full production of the Cybertruck.",

                    "title": "A 120-year-old company is leaving Tesla in the dust - NZ Herald",
                    "body": "Tesla had me convinced, for a while, that it was a cool company.\n\nIt made cars that performed animatronic holiday shows using their lights and power-operated doors. It came up with dog mode (a climate control system that stays running for dogs in a parked car), a GPS-linked air suspension that remembers where the speed bumps are and raises the car automatically, and \"fart mode\" (where the car makes fart sounds).\n\nAnd, fundamentally, its cars had no competition. If you wanted an electric car that could go more than 250 miles (402 kilometres) between charges, Tesla was your only choice for the better part of a decade. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, came across as goofy and eccentric: you could build great cars and name each model such that the lineup spells \"SEXY\".\n\nOr you would, if not for the party-killers over at boring old Ford. Ford thwarted Musk's \"SEXY\" gambit by preventing Tesla from naming its small sedan the Model E, since that sounds a bit too much like a certain famous Ford, the Model T. So Musk went with Model 3, which either ruins the joke or elevates it, depending on how much you venerate Tesla and Elon Musk. I count myself as a former admirer of Musk and Tesla, and in fact put a deposit on a Model 3 after my first drive of one.\n\nBut the more I dealt with Tesla as a reporter -- this was before Musk fired all the PR people who worked there -- the more sceptical I became. Any time I spoke to anyone at Tesla, there was a sense that they were terrified to say the wrong thing, or anything at all. I wanted to know the horsepower of the Model 3 I was driving, and the result was like one of those oblique Mafia conversations where nothing's stated explicitly, in case the Feds are listening. I ended up saying, \"Well, I read that this car has 271 horsepower,\" and the Tesla person replied, \"I wouldn't disagree with that.\" This is not how healthy, functional companies answer simple factual questions.\n\nThat was back in 2017. In the years since, Tesla's become even crankier, while its competition has loosened up. Public perception hasn't yet caught up with the reality of the situation. If you want to work for a flexible, modern company, you don't apply to Tesla. You apply to 120-year-old Ford.\n\nTesla's veneer of irreverence conceals an inflexible core, an old-fashioned corporate autocracy. Consider Tesla's remote work policy, or lack thereof. Last year, Musk issued a decree that Tesla employees log 40 hours per week in an office -- and not a home office -- if they expected to keep their jobs. On Indeed.com, the question, \"Can you work remotely at Tesla?\" includes answers like, \"No,\" and \"Absolutely not, they won't let it happen under any circumstances,\" and \"No, Tesla will work you until you lose everything.\"\n\nBut on the other hand, the cars make fart noises. What a zany and carefree company!\n\nFord's work-from-home rules for white-collar employees, meanwhile, sound straight out of Silicon Valley, in that the official corporate policy is that there is no official corporate policy -- it's up to the leaders of individual units to require in-person collaboration, or not, as situations dictate. There are new \"collaboration centres\" in lieu of cubicle farms, complete with food service and concierges. That's not the reality of daily work life for every person at Ford -- you can't exactly bolt together an F-150 from home -- but it's an attempt to provide some flexibility for as many people as possible.\n\nFord also tends to make good on its promises, an area that's become increasingly fraught for Tesla. Ford said it would offer a hands-free driver assist system, and now it does, with BlueCruise; you can take your hands off the steering wheel when it is engaged on pre-mapped sections of highway. Tesla's Full Self-Driving system is not hands-free in any situation, despite its name, and Tesla charges customers US$15,000 for the feature on the promise that someday it will make the huge leap to full autonomous driving.\n\nIf you want to pay US$15,000 for a feature that's currently subject to a US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recall whose filing is titled \"Full Self-Driving Software May Cause Crash,\" don't let me stop you, but a Tesla engineer also recently testified that a company video purporting to show the system in flawless action was faked. This makes sense, given all the other very real videos of Full Self-Driving doing things like steering into oncoming traffic or braking to a complete stop on a busy street for no reason. Tesla's own website warns, \"The currently enabled features require a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.\" So, full self-driving, except for that.\n\nTesla's long-promised new vehicles, like the Cybertruck and a new version of its Roadster, also keep getting delayed. The Cybertruck was unveiled in 2019, and on Tesla's most recent earnings call Musk admitted that it won't be in production this year, which is becoming an annual refrain. Sure, Ford sold only 15,617 electric F-150 Lightning pickups in 2022, but that beats the Cybertruck's sales by, let's see, 15,617. Besides stealing Tesla's market share on trucks, Ford's stealing its corporate impishness, too -- when the electric Mustang Mach-E was unveiled, Ford demonstrated its tailgating possibilities by filling its drainable front trunk (or \"frunk\") with shrimp. \"Frunk shrimp\" became a meme, which surely tormented the emperor of try-hard social media posting, Elon Musk.\n\nSpeaking of which: Twitter. I will hazard the opinion that Musk's US$44 billion purchase of Twitter has not exactly burnished Tesla's reputation. Besides showcasing the questionable decision-making inherent in paying that much for Twitter, Musk's heightened profile on the platform hasn't really done him any favours. For instance, when the bulk of your car company's sales are in blue states, is it helpful to tweet, \"My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci\"? Moreover, you'd think that the self-appointed class clown of corporate America would at least strive for a joke that eschews the hacky \"my pronouns are/I identify as\" construction. Maybe just go with \"Fauci makes me grouchy?\" Elon, let's workshop this next time.\n\nMaybe predictability isn't trendy, but if you buy a new car you'd probably like to think that its manufacturer won't cut the price by US$13,000 the next week, thus destroying your car's resale value. And you might hope that features you pay for work on the day you pay for them, and not at some unspecified future date. Maybe you want a car from a company whose CEO isn't indelibly associated with the product.\n\nI just bought a Jeep and I have no idea who the CEO is there. That's cool with me.",

The luxury sedan and SUV still hover at $90,000 or more and don't qualify for federal EV tax breaks -- even under the Inflation Reduction Act, although the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y do.\n\nAn all-wheel-drive Tesla Model S now starts at $91,380, including mandatory destination fees, which is $5,000 less than before. A Model X costs $101,380, including destination, which is $10,000 less. Model S and Model X Plaid models were similarly reduced by $5,000 and $10,000, respectively, and are significantly less than they were in January, by $26,000 and $29,000.\n\nSince early January, prices for all Tesla models have dropped between 6% and 20%, according to Reuters, although the prices for the Model 3 and Model Y have fluctuated up and down in the same period.\n\nThe price reductions for the Model S and Model X follow the company's investor day last week where the automaker outlined its plans for growth in charging, home energy storage, and sustainability, but with little news about new models from Tesla. The company said affordability remained its most limiting factor to entice new buyers but said it would offer a cheaper next-generation car while it drove its manufacturing costs down.\n\nTesla's priciest Model S and Model X cars haven't qualified for federal tax benefits for several years now, although versions of the Model 3 and Model Y do. Last year, the company missed its delivery targets by 50%, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the automaker would deliver 2 million vehicles in 2023 as price cuts boosted demand for their vehicles worldwide. In other countries, new prices for Teslas have dropped by up to 18%.\n\nGot a tip? Send it in to tips@thedrive.com\n\nCar Buying NewsCar TechElectric VehiclesNews by BrandTesla News",

The pricing adjustment could be an attempt to increase sales before the end of the quarter.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Model S is now available for $89,990, down 5.2%, or about $5,000, from the previous $94,990. The Model S Plaid is now $109,990, down 4.3% from $114,990.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Model X is $99,990, down 9.1%, or $10,000 (from $109,990). The Model X Plaid is now $109,990, down 8.3% from $119,990.\n\nRecall that the last price reduction was in January, which caused indignation among buyers who purchased cars shortly before price adjustments.",

                    "title": "Tesla Cuts Model S and Model X Prices Again, but the EVs Are Still Expensive",
                    "body": "How much does a Tesla cost? The question seems straightforward, but Elon Musk's electric vehicle company has been adjusting its prices so much this year, it's a little hard to keep up.\n\nIn the most recent change, Tesla has cut its Model S and Model X prices by between 4% and 9% depending on the exact vehicle variant. Both Model S versions are now $5,000 cheaper -- equal to a 5% decrease for the standard, which now costs $89,000. While the Model S's higher performance \"Plaid\" variant is now $109,990, equal to a 4% decline.\n\nThe cuts to the Model X crossover SUV were even steeper -- both versions have been slashed by $10,000. The standard is now $99,990, equal to a 9% cut. The\n\nPlaid variant is now $109,990, equal to an 8% reduction.\n\nThe changes impact vehicles sold in the U.S. and are already in effect on Tesla's website. They were first noted by company investors and others on Twitter.\n\nBack in January, Tesla lowered its car prices in the U.S. and Europe by as much as 20% depending on vehicle model and location. Those earlier cuts impacted all of the company's models, and if you include those changes, then the cost of a Model S or Model X has fallen by between 14% and 21% since the beginning of 2023, according to a report from Bloomberg.\n\nThe price changes come less than week after Tesla's Investor Day and Musk's presentation of the company's \"Master Plan 3.\" During that event, the billionaire highlighted numerous cost reduction strategies Tesla had developed in its vehicle production process -- making it cheaper for the company to manufacture its cars. Musk also indicated that earlier January price cuts had bolstered customer desire for vehicles. \"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" the CEO said.\n\nPresumably, this most recent round of reductions is intended to increase demand, once again. Perhaps the boost in Model X and S orders didn't meet expectations or match the appetite for the company's other cars.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay,\" the CEO said. Musk added that the desire to own one of his company's cars is \"indistinguishable from infinite\" and that, as Tesla lowers its prices demand will \"go crazy.\"\n\nThough, even with thousands of dollars taken off Tesla price tags, the vehicles remain prohibitively expensive for most. The cheapest Tesla model, the Model 3, starts at $42,990. Compare that with the Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and Mini Cooper SE that are all under $30,000. And, with the rise of these truly affordable options, Tesla is facing increased market competition -- with its longtime dominance under threat.\n\nIn the original, 2006 Tesla Master Plan, Musk promised that his company would work to produce progressively cheaper electric vehicles, making them accessible to a broad array of consumers. In recent years, the billionaire has hinted at a possible $25,000 Tesla EV -- often referred to as the \"Model 2.\" However, that price point still seems to be very far off, and Musk offered no update on such a car as part of last week's presentation.\n\nGizmodo reached out to Tesla for comment via Twitter and email, but the company did not immediately respond. Instead, Gizmodo received an emailed error message. \"The recipient's mailbox is full and can't accept messages now. Please try resending your message later, or contact the recipient directly.\" Tesla dissolved it's public relations department back in 2020. Since then, the company has rarely replied directly to journalists' questions.",

                    "body": "Tesla's most expensive vehicles - the Model S and Model X - have received price cuts of 5% and 9% respectively to stoke demand, Reuters has reported. The decision from the company is pretty interesting given the massive price inflation we are seeing for goods around much of the world, nevertheless, Tesla thinks attracting customers at lower prices is the best choice right now.\n\nIn addition to the discounts mentioned above, the Plaid editions of the Model S and Model X have also received discounts. The Model S Plaid is down by 4% and the Model X Plaid has been reduced by 8% - prices start at $109,990. The price drops, which are already available through Tesla's website, mark the fifth price adjustment this year.\n\nLast week at Tesla's Investor day, CEO Elon Musk said that many people wish to own Tesla vehicles but the prices a prohibitive so the company is looking for ways to make them more affordable. The company has not commented on the latest price drops so it's unclear how permanent they'll be or how the company has managed to cut prices.\n\nThe new prices apply in the United States but it's not clear if pricing in other markets has changed at all. It'll be interesting to hear from the company in future quarterly earnings calls whether it saw a pick up in the number of sales as a result of these price drops.\n\nSource: Reuters",

                    "body": "The EVs were revolutionary at launch but are now aging compared to competitors.\n\nTesla is cutting prices for the second time in less than eight weeks. Reuters noticed that the automaker has dropped the prices of its more expensive, aging Model S sedan and Model X SUV yet again.\n\nWhile these cars were revolutionary at launch in 2012 and 2015, they now face stiff competition from much newer vehicles from the likes of Rivian, Lucid, Mercedes, Porsche, and BMW. As a result, Model S and Model X sales combined represented only 5 percent of Tesla's global sales in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, a dual-motor all-wheel-drive Tesla Model S went for $104,990. In January, Tesla chopped about 10 percent off the price, dropping it to $94,990. Today, it's another $5,000 cheaper at $89,990.\n\nFor those who want to go really fast, the Model S Plaid, which uses three motors for a sub-2-second 0-60 mph time and a 200 mph top speed, is now $109,990, $5,000 less than last week and $26,000 less than you'd have paid in 2022.\n\nThe Model X SUV sees even bigger discounts. After heavy price drops in January, Tesla has now cut an extra $10,000 from Model X prices. That means the all-wheel-drive dual-motor version now starts at $99,990, with the triple-motor Plaid Model X starting at $109,990.\n\nHow long those prices will stay is anyone's guess. Within less than a month of enacting its January price cuts, Tesla had already increased the prices of the Model Y crossover again.",

                    "body": "This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nTesla, as the apex predator of the EV world, continues to sacrifice its industry-leading profit margin to maintain demand. However, this strategy of aggressive price cuts now poses an outsized risk to the EV giant's nascent competitors, including Lucid Group.\n\nEarlier today, Tesla reduced the base price of its Model S by 5.3 percent and that of Model X by 9.1 percent in the US. Moreover, following material price cuts, the Plaid versions of both models are now priced at $109,990. Previously, the Model S Plaid carried a retail price of $114,990, while the Model X Plaid retailed at $119,990 in the US.\n\nOf course, Tesla has already discounted the price of its Model 3 and Model Y EVs by around 20 percent. These aggressive price cuts have allowed Tesla to regain the delivery momentum that it had lost toward the end of last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla has also reduced the price of its unsold EVs in Europe by around 6 percent.\n\nThese price cuts are in addition to a general discount of around 20 percent in Europe.\n\nWhile most analysts expect Tesla's price-cutting strategy to materially curtail its profit in the ongoing quarter, this \"beggar thy competitor\" strategy portends a catastrophic plunge in demand for companies such as Lucid Group, whose Air EV competes directly with Tesla's Model S and Model X.\n\nEven before today's move by Tesla, Lucid Group was suffering from elevated inventory levels. As we noted last week, Lucid Group's deliveries have continued to lag its production cadence. In Q4, this mismatch stood at 1,561 units. When taking into account the full-year figures, this mismatch increases to 2,811 units. Additionally, Lucid Group is now targeting a full-year production of just around 14,000 units, substantially below the output of 49,000 units that the company had promised during its pre-SPAC-merger phase.\n\nIn another troubling sign, the reservations for the Air EV declined by around 6,000 units during the fourth quarter of 2022 to around 28,000 units. This suggests that buyers might be having second thoughts about their decision to bet on a relatively new entrant in this increasingly challenging field.",

                    "body": "This is Tesla's fifth price adjustment in 2023 alone, which may give some potential buyers pause over concerns their desired vehicle could be significantly cheaper a few weeks from now.\n\nIt's been a rollercoaster few months for Tesla pricing, and those who just purchased a Model S sedan or Model X SUV may be annoyed by the latest adjustments.\n\nAs Reuters notes, the Model S is now $5,000 cheaper -- a 4% discount -- while Tesla shaved $10,000 off the price of a Model X, a 9% cut. Get the standard Model S for $89,990 or the Plaid performance version for $109,990. The all-wheel-drive (AWD) Model X, meanwhile, is now $99,990 while the Plaid version starts at $109,990.\n\nThe move is Tesla's fifth price cut since the start of 2023, Reuters says, which may give some potential buyers pause, given that their desired vehicle could be thousands of dollars less just a few weeks from now.\n\nIn January, for example, the full lineup saw price cuts, most notably the 20% reduction for the Model Y, which made it eligible for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. That came after the luxury car maker offered a $7,500 discount on all orders placed by the end of 2022.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" CEO Elon Musk said during last week's Tesla investor day. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIt's a familiar refrain from Musk. During a Q3 earnings call last year, Musk said that Tesla's next big vehicle launch would be a smaller, cheaper vehicle (once the Cybertruck launches, that is). \"Our next-generation vehicle will be about half the cost [of the Tesla Model X, Y], it'll be smaller, but it will swiftly exceed production of all our other vehicles combined,\" he said.\n\nNot surprisingly, Tesla's cheaper models are more popular with buyers. The Model 3, which currently starts at $42,990, and the Model Y, with a base price of $54,990, made up the bulk of Tesla's deliveries in 2022. Tesla delivered about 1.2 million Model 3 and Y vehicles last year, according to its Q4 earnings report, compared to 66,705 Model S and X EVs.\n\nSome 3,470 Model Y vehicles, meanwhile, are being recalled over concerns that second-row seat-back bolts may not be securely tightened, which could reduce the seat belt's performance and increase injury risks in the case of a crash. Tesla estimates 4% of recalled cars have the defect.",

                    "body": "Tesla, recently, has sparked a bit of a price war in the EV sphere, after cutting prices on some of its cars in January. The strategy may be due to some kind of tax incentive alchemy or simply to induce more demand, since Teslas are no longer the only EV game in town, nor even close to the best. In the past couple days, Tesla has lowered the price of its Model S and Model X, Reuters reports.\n\nThe price cuts will mean nothing to anyone who's not in the market for a Model S or Model X, which is the vast majority of people; those top-tier models made up a mere four percent of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. And yet, for anyone looking for weakness in Tesla, or for any other mildly-curious observer of the EV market, it is telling of something that Tesla thinks it can't sell the Model S and Model X for what it used to. From Reuters:\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.\n\nThe across-the-board discounts are especially surprising given CEO Elon Musk's past comments expressing disgust at the idea of cutting prices. As Torque News reminds us, in 2016, Musk sent a directive to Tesla employees stating, \"There can never -- and I mean never -- be a discount on a new car coming out of the factory in pristine condition.\"\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk doesn't believe in model years, even though Teslas do get updated. But this seems like, too, an admission that the Model S and Model X are what they are, which is, old products.",

                    "body": "It's been a rollercoaster few months for Tesla pricing, and those who just purchased a Model S sedan or Model X SUV may be annoyed by the latest adjustments.\n\nAs Reuters notes(Opens in a new window), the Model S is now $5,000 cheaper -- a 4% discount -- while Tesla shaved $10,000 off the price of a Model X, a 9% cut. Get the standard Model S for $89,990 or the Plaid performance version for $109,990. The all-wheel-drive (AWD) Model X, meanwhile, is now $99,990 while the Plaid version starts at $109,990.\n\nThe move is Tesla's fifth price cut since the start of 2023, Reuters says, which may give some potential buyers pause, given that their desired vehicle could be thousands of dollars less just a few weeks from now.\n\nIn January, for example, the full lineup saw price cuts, most notably the 20% reduction for the Model Y, which made it eligible for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. That came after the luxury car maker offered a $7,500 discount on all orders placed by the end of 2022.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" CEO Elon Musk said during last week's Tesla investor day. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nIt's a familiar refrain from Musk. During a Q3 earnings call last year, Musk said that Tesla's next big vehicle launch would be a smaller, cheaper vehicle (once the Cybertruck launches, that is). \"Our next-generation vehicle will be about half the cost [of the Tesla Model X, Y], it'll be smaller, but it will swiftly exceed production of all our other vehicles combined,\" he said.\n\nNot surprisingly, Tesla's cheaper models are more popular with buyers. The Model 3, which currently starts at $42,990, and the Model Y, with a base price of $54,990, made up the bulk of Tesla's deliveries in 2022. Tesla delivered about 1.2 million Model 3 and Y vehicles last year, according to its Q4 earnings report(Opens in a new window), compared to 66,705 Model S and X EVs.\n\nSome 3,470 Model Y vehicles, meanwhile, are being recalled over concerns that second-row seat-back bolts may not be securely tightened, which could reduce the seat belt's performance and increase injury risks in the case of a crash. Tesla estimates 4% of recalled cars have the defect.",

                    "body": "In January, the electric automaker reduced the prices of the Model S and Model X by up to $21,000, depending on the trim, and on Sunday, cut them again.\n\nThe entry-level Model S Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive now starts at $89,990, a $5,000 reduction that brings this year's cut to $15,000.\n\nThe higher performance Model S Plaid was also reduced by $5,000 to $109,990, which represents a $26,000 drop since the start of 2023.\n\nTESLA NETS MASSIVE NEVADA TAX BREAKS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE FACTORY EXPANSIONS\n\nThe same trims of the Model X had their prices lowered by $10,000 to $99,990 and $109,990. The SUVs were $120,990 and $138,990 at the beginning of the year.\n\nTesla sells its vehicles directly to consumers and frequently updates their list prices rather than using typical incentive or discount programs.\n\nSeveral recent Tesla buyers voiced their displeasure with the January cuts, citing the apparent loss in value they precipitated.\n\nTESLA'S 1950S-STYLE DRIVE IN DINER AND MOVIE CHARGING STATION REVEALED\n\n\"I feel like I got duped. I feel like a got taken advantage of as a consumer,\" Marianne Simmons, a Tesla owner who purchased her latest vehicle from the company in September, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"Right off the bat, I'm out $13,306. It's such a large reduction that it's going to affect a lot of people who just bought a vehicle.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nDuring Tesla's investor day presentation last week, CEO Elon Musk said cutting manufacturing costs was one of the company's main goals and that the next generation vehicle it will build in Mexico will be 50% cheaper to build than the platform used for the Model 3 and Model Y, it's lowest priced vehicles today.\n\nFox Business' Bradford Betz contributed to this report",

                    "body": "This has ignited a price war among carmakers competing to lower their prices in a bid to lure in more customers and drive sales.\n\nTesla cut prices on its two most expensive models in the U.S., the Model S and Model X, in a renewed bid to stoke demand for its cars with aggressive discounts.\n\nThe Tesla Model S now starts at $89,990, according to Tesla's website, down around 5% from where they were priced previously. The Model X, meanwhile, starts at $99,990, which marks a 9% reduction.\n\nFor the high-end \"Plaid\" versions of the Model S and Model X, car buyers can now expect to pay $109,990. That's down 4% for the Model S Plaid, and 8% for the Model X Plaid.\n\nTesla shares were up around 0.6% in U.S. premarket trading Monday.\n\nIt follows a series of aggressive discounts from the company in recent months. In January, Tesla reduced prices of its new cars by as much as 20%, making the vehicles more affordable and likely eligible for federal tax credits in the U.S.\n\nThe latest price reduction is likely unrelated to EV tax credits introduced in President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, as they remain above the $55,000 threshold to qualify for up to $7,500 toward purchasing new vehicles.\n\nThe pace and frequency of Tesla's price adjustments goes beyond what established automakers have attempted in the industry, where the base price of a vehicle in inventory is still referred to as a \"sticker price.\"\n\nThis has ignited a price war among carmakers competing to lower their prices in a bid to lure in more customers and drive sales. After Tesla's January price reductions, Ford slashed prices on its electric Mustang Mach-E crossover by up to 8%.\n\nMusk has shifted Tesla's focus of late to bringing prices down to spur demand for its products.\n\nOn the firm's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, he said Tesla was seeing orders almost doubling the rate of production. \"These price changes really make a difference for the average consumer,\" Musk said at the time.\n\n\"The price cuts Tesla has already implemented globally has catalyzed demand by 30% out of the gates as this latest price cut is another smart move,\" Dan Ives, managing director of equities at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC via email.\n\n\"This is an EV arms race playing out and Tesla has the margins to make price cuts and still be well above other automakers. In this economic cloudiness Tesla needs to rip the band-aid off and cut prices and the Street will like this.\"\n\nTo make discounts of those proportions, Tesla will need to match them with production cost reductions. It's a goal the company has been pushing hard to achieve, with efforts to cut down on certain spending in its supply chain already underway.\n\nLast week, a Tesla executive said the company was developing an EV motor that can be built without rare earth metals -- which are critical to the motors used in electric vehicles -- citing the need to lower costs and environmental risks that accompany the mining of these minerals.",

                    "body": "Tesla is lowering the price of its performance Model S and Model X vehicles by up to US$10,000, two months after the mass Model 3 and Model Y saw a similar decrease. Of course, the prices of the Model X and Model S are much higher to begin with, so the price drop is not that significant as a percentage, but their demand is also less elastic as these are considered to be Tesla's premium cars. The two showcases of Tesla's EV technology prowess now cost as follows:\n\nThe new Model X and Model S price reductions seem designed to carry demand towards the last month of the quarter, though they are unlikely to move Tesla's Q1 revenue needle by much as the expensive models only represent about 3% of its sales. Still, it's been a while since the Model X started below a hundred grand, while the Model S price is now closer to that of the base Lucid Air trim with the single RWD motor.\n\nThe price war that Tesla started in January will mark the EV industry throughout the year, it seems, as the cost of acquiring and owning an electric car starts catching up to gas-powered mass market darlings thanks to the government's largesse. A recent breakdown of Tesla Model 3 pricing after federal tax credits and local incentives in states with generous EV subsidies like Oregon, found that the 2023 Model 3 could cost the same as a base Toyota Corolla XSE there, for instance.",

                    "body": "FLORIDA (Reuters): Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has slashed prices of its electric vehicles in the United States and Europe, doubling down on a discount drive it started in Asia as demand slows against the backdrop of a weakening economy.\n\nIn 2022, the Elon Musk-led company missed its target to grow deliveries by 50% annually as it struggled with supply chain constraints and a demand slowdown caused by growing recession fears. Still, Musk has said the carmaker could deliver 2 million vehicles in 2023 as price cuts boost demand.\n\nChina-made Tesla car sales rose 18% in January from a five-month low hit in December. February saw a 12.6% rise.\n\nTesla slashed prices for all versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China by between 6.0% and 13.5% in January, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nIn February, however, the carmaker raised prices of the performance and long-range versions of its Model Y mid-size sport utility vehicles (SUV) in China.\n\nIn the second such price increase, starting prices of the two versions of Model Y in China increased by 2,000 yuan each to 311,900 yuan ($44,983.20) and 361,900 yuan.\n\nThe performance Model Y remains 9% cheaper than before the price cuts, while the long-range version is 13% cheaper.\n\nJAPAN\n\nTesla cut the prices of its Model 3 and Model Y cars by about 10% each in the country - for the first time since 2021. The price for the Model 3 rear-wheel drive version is now 5.369 million yen ($39,501.18), down from 5.964 million yen.\n\nSOUTH KOREA\n\nTesla's price cuts in the country differed from model to model, but ranged from about 6 million won to 10 million won ($7,702.74), a local Tesla sales official said.\n\nThe price of Tesla's basic Model 3 rear-wheel drive vehicle was listed as 64.34 million won ($50,637) on the company's website on Friday. Its Model Y Long Range sports utility vehicle was 84.999 million won.\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nTesla's U.S. price cuts on its global top-sellers, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover SUV, were between 6% and 20%, Reuters calculations showed.\n\nIt raised the price of the Model Y at least three times after that. Still, the Model Y is about 16% cheaper than it was in early January for U.S. customers.\n\nThe company further cut prices for its Model X luxury crossover SUV by 9% and Model S sedan by 4% in the United States.\n\nGERMANY\n\nTesla cut prices on the Model 3 and the Model Y by about 1% to almost 17% depending on the configuration.\n\nFRANCE\n\nCustomers buying the Model 3 for 44,990 euros ($47,860.36)will now get a further price reduction through a government subsidy of 5,000 euros. The upper limit for the EV scheme is 47,000 euros.",

                    "body": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc has slashed prices of its electric vehicles in the United States and Europe, doubling down on a discount drive it started in Asia as demand slows against the backdrop of a weakening economy.\n\nIn 2022, the Elon Musk-led company missed its target to grow deliveries by 50% annually as it struggled with supply chain constraints and a demand slowdown caused by growing recession fears. Still, Musk has said the carmaker could deliver 2 million vehicles in 2023 as price cuts boost demand.\n\nChina-made Tesla car sales rose 18% in January from a five-month low hit in December. February saw a 12.6% rise.\n\nTesla slashed prices for all versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China by between 6.0% and 13.5% in January, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nIn February, however, the carmaker raised prices of the performance and long-range versions of its Model Y mid-size sport utility vehicles (SUV) in China.\n\nIn the second such price increase, starting prices of the two versions of Model Y in China increased by 2,000 yuan each to 311,900 yuan ($44,983.20) and 361,900 yuan.\n\nThe performance Model Y remains 9% cheaper than before the price cuts, while the long-range version is 13% cheaper.\n\nJAPAN\n\nTesla cut the prices of its Model 3 and Model Y cars by about 10% each in the country - for the first time since 2021. The price for the Model 3 rear-wheel drive version is now 5.369 million yen ($39,501.18), down from 5.964 million yen.\n\nSOUTH KOREA\n\nTesla's price cuts in the country differed from model to model, but ranged from about 6 million won to 10 million won ($7,702.74), a local Tesla sales official said.\n\nThe price of Tesla's basic Model 3 rear-wheel drive vehicle was listed as 64.34 million won ($50,637) on the company's website on Friday. Its Model Y Long Range sports utility vehicle was 84.999 million won.\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nTesla's U.S. price cuts on its global top-sellers, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover SUV, were between 6% and 20%, Reuters calculations showed.\n\nIt raised the price of the Model Y at least three times after that. Still, the Model Y is about 16% cheaper than it was in early January for U.S. customers.\n\nThe company further cut prices for its Model X luxury crossover SUV by 9% and Model S sedan by 4% in the United States.\n\nGERMANY\n\nTesla cut prices on the Model 3 and the Model Y by about 1% to almost 17% depending on the configuration.\n\nFRANCE\n\nCustomers buying the Model 3 for 44,990 euros ($47,860.36)will now get a further price reduction through a government subsidy of 5,000 euros. The upper limit for the EV scheme is 47,000 euros.\n\n(Compiled by Anne Marie Roantree, Tiyashi Datta, Akash Sriram and Chavi Mehta; Editing by Kim Coghill and Shounak Dasgupta)",

                    "body": "It's the second time this this year that the EV maker has cut prices\n\nTesla Inc. slashed the price of its Model X crossover in Canada late Sunday night by C$7,000.\n\nThe the dual-motor, all-wheel drive Model X now starts at C$135,990, while the Plaid fell to C$149,990, the same price as the Model S Plaid.\n\nSimilar cuts were made in the United States, where Tesla dropped the prices of its Model S sedan and Model X crossover by US$5,000 and US$10,000 respectively as the company seeks to goose demand in the final month of the quarter.\n\nIn the United States, The Model S all-wheel drive is now US$89,990, down 5.2 per cent from US$94,990, according to the company's website. The Model S Plaid is now US$109,990, down 4.3 per cent from US$114,990. The Model X all-wheel drive is now US$99,990, down 9.1 per cent from US$109,990. The Model X Plaid is now US$109,990, down 8.3 per cent from US$119,990.Tesla sells its cars direct to consumers and often tweaks its pricing. The latest moves come even though Tesla drastically cut prices in January in a broad bid to boost sales.\n\nAt the company's March 1 investor day, held at Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and other leaders emphasized manufacturing efficiency and cost cutting.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" said Musk. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nAt US$109,990, Plaid iterations of the S and X now cost US$26,000 and US$29,000 less than they did in early January in the United States.\n\nMusk said last week that desire to own Teslas was \"indistinguishable from infinite,\" and that demand will \"go crazy\" as the company makes its cars more affordable. Reducing prices of S and the X models again suggests those vehicles might have gotten less of a boost from cuts the company made across its lineup seven weeks ago.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" Musk said during Tesla's March 1 investor day.\n\nTesla shares rose 0.5 per cent as of 6 a.m. New York time Monday, before the start of regular trading.\n\nThe stock has climbed 61 per cent this year after plunging 65 percent in 2022.\n\nTesla's dynamic pricing is unique in the automotive world, where manufacturers typically only make changes to what they suggest their retailers charge from one model year to the next. Reductions to the Model 3 and Y in January made those vehicles cheaper relative to the average price of a new vehicle in the United States than ever before.\n\nThe changes to the 3 and Y were at least in part driven by Tesla wanting those models to qualify for U.S. tax credits made available by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nAfter the Biden administration changed how it distinguished between passenger cars and sport utility vehicles in early February, thereby raising the price limit for Model Ys to be eligibile for credits, Tesla bumped prices back up.",

The company lowered prices of the higher-performance Plaid versions of each vehicle by 4.3% and 8.3%.\n\nRead here: Tesla recalls 3,470 Model Y vehicles over loose bolts\n\nAt $109,990, Plaid iterations of the S and X now cost $26,000 and $29,000 less than they did in early January.\n\nMusk said last week that desire to own Teslas was \"indistinguishable from infinite,\" and that demand will \"go crazy\" as the company makes its cars more affordable. Reducing prices of S and the X models again suggests those vehicles may have gotten less of a boost from cuts the company made across its lineup seven weeks ago.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" Musk said during Tesla's March 1 investor day.\n\nTesla shares rose 0.5% as of 6 a.m. New York time Monday, before the start of regular trading. The stock has climbed 61% this year after plunging 65% in 2022.\n\nTesla's dynamic pricing is unique in the automotive world, where manufacturers typically only make changes to what they suggest their retailers charge from one model year to the next. Reductions to the Model 3 and Y in January made those vehicles cheaper relative to the average price of a new vehicle in the US than ever before.\n\nRead here: Tesla stock plunges 6% after Elon Musk's 'master plan' fails to impress: Report\n\nThe changes to the 3 and Y were at least in part driven by Tesla wanting those models to qualify for tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act. After the Biden administration changed how it distinguished between passenger cars and sport utility vehicles in early February, thereby raising the price limit for Model Ys to be eligible for credits, Tesla bumped prices back up.",

                    "title": "Tesla Cuts Prices Again, but This Nasdaq Energy Stock Is Monday's Winner | The Motley Fool",
                    "body": "Wall Street didn't seem confident about continuing the market rally from last week.\n\nInvestors have seen a topsy-turvy stock market so far in 2023, with early gains in January giving way to more anxiety in February. After seeing solid gains during the first few days of March, market participants came back from the weekend uncertain about what the future will bring. Stock index futures on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were roughly unchanged a couple of hours before the beginning of the regular trading session as a result.\n\nAs is often the case, electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla (TSLA 3.61%) got some attention on Monday morning, as the automaker once again took steps to try to bolster demand in the face of tough macroeconomic conditions. However, another stock listed on the Nasdaq enjoyed much more significant gains, with shareholders benefiting from a well-known effect that often helps to boost stocks of companies in similar situations. Read on to learn more about what Tesla did and to discover the name of this rising Nasdaq energy stock.\n\nShares of Tesla were little changed early Monday morning. The automaker made more moves to bolster demand of its EVs by making them more affordable, but this time, Tesla focused on the higher end of its product line to make price cuts.\n\nTesla reduced the prices of its luxury Model S and Model X vehicles for buyers in the U.S. market, according to multiple sources. The Model S got a $5,000 price cut, bringing the price of the all-wheel-drive version of the electric sedan to $89,990 and the Plaid version down to $109,990. Model X buyers got even bigger breaks, with a $10,000 reduction in price. That brought the current cost to $99,990 for the regular all-wheel drive version of the electric SUV and $109,990 for the Model X Plaid.\n\nInvestors remain divided about what Tesla's price cuts mean for its longer-term prospects. Some believe that the moves are negative for Tesla, arguing that they prove the automaker's need to reduce revenue in order to sustain demand and high delivery numbers. Competition is increasingly important as well, especially in the battleground EV market in China, where one rival already sells more vehicles than Tesla and others occupy key niches.\n\nOthers, though, believe Tesla's ability to cut prices will give it competitive advantages over would-be rivals, potentially giving it more market share. With massive margins already in place, Tesla can arguably afford to give up some of its profits in the short run in order to give itself a more commanding position in the market in the years to come.\n\nThose looking for a bigger share-price move took note of Chord Energy (CHRD 7.54%) on Monday morning. The energy company jumped nearly 6% in premarket trading, as investors reacted to the inclusion of its stock in a popular market index.\n\nChord got an invitation from S&P Dow Jones Indices to join the S&P MidCap 400 index effective March 20. The move comes as the index manager makes its quarterly rebalancing trades, with the idea being for its indexes to reflect their respective market capitalization ranges in a more representative manner. Chord was among 10 companies making the move into the S&P MidCap 400, replacing companies that will be moving lower into the S&P SmallCap 600 index.\n\nChord Energy might not be familiar to some investors, because it's the new post-merger name for two companies that combined in mid-2022. Both Whiting Petroleum and Oasis Petroleum were major producers in the Williston Basin area centered on western North Dakota, and combining forces enabled them to enjoy greater efficiency and cut costs. Along with higher energy prices, that has helped Chord pay an impressive 7.5% dividend yield.\n\nMany stocks -- including Tesla -- have benefited when they've been able to join high-profile stock indexes. Chord Energy isn't huge, but it will still get some new attention from investors as a result of its being part of the S&P MidCap 400.",

(CIEN) reported on Monday that profit for the first quarter increased from last year, driven by strong 25 percent revenue growth despite supply chain challenges. Adjusted earnings per share and quarterly revenues topped analysts' expectations. Luxury electric major Tesla Inc. has slashed prices of its Model S sedan and Model X SUV vehicles in the United States, aiming to boost demand. The price cut comes for the second time this year after the company drastically cut prices in January in a bid to boost sales. According to the company's website, around $5,000 was reduced on Model S price and around $10,000 on Model X vehicles. U.S. investment manager Harris Associates, once a major shareholder of Credit Suisse Group AG, has sold its entire stake in the Swiss banking major, the Financial Times reported. The investor ended its about two decades of ownership after raising questions about the future of the franchise.",

The cuts come just days after Chief Executive Elon Musk said recent price cuts on other models had stoked demand.\n\nThese most recent price cuts are the automaker's fifth adjustment since the start of the year; ranged from 4% on the performance version of the Model S to 9% on the more expensive Model X.\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.\n\nMusk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nShares of TSLA are up 0.02% in pre-market trading on Monday.",

                    "body": "As per Tesla's website, the company has reduced the prices of its two most expensive electric vehicles in North America. This decision follows the investor day event held last week, during which Elon Musk stated that recent price cuts had sparked demand for more affordable models.\n\nThe starting prices for the Model S and X in the US have been reduced by 5.3% and 9.1%, respectively, to $89,990 and $99,990. Additionally, the higher-performance Plaid version of the Model S and X have been lowered by 4.3% and 8.3%. The Plaid iterations of the S and X, which now cost $109,990, have been reduced by $26,000 and $29,000 compared to their prices in early January.\n\nLast week, Musk claimed that the demand for Teslas was nearly unlimited and would increase significantly as the company made its vehicles more affordable. The recent price reductions for the S and X models imply that these vehicles may not have experienced the same boost in demand as the rest of the lineup when the company reduced prices earlier this year.\n\nIn January, Tesla slashed the prices of its more affordable vehicles by as much as 20%, which enabled buyers to qualify for the tax incentive by putting the vehicles under a $55,000 cap.\n\nMusk directly addressed the price cuts during the investor day: \"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big.\"\n\nElectrek's Fred Lambert reported last month that price cuts of Model Y vehicles led to \"unprecedented demand\" in the US. He said the EV crossover sold out entirely, with no more production builds until April.\n\nWe pointed out in late January, \"Tesla 'Weaponizes' Price-Cuts To Crush EV Competition.\"\n\nAccording to Bank of America analyst John Murphy, legacy automakers have thin profit margins or even incur losses on their electric vehicle offerings due to their lack of scale in the EV market, unlike Tesla. Murphy suggests that Tesla's recent price cuts could prompt automakers to lower their own EV prices in response, potentially sparking a price war.\n\n\"These price cuts are likely to make business even more difficult, just as they are attempting to ramp production of EV offerings,\" Murphy said.\n\nReuters noted Tesla is planning to begin production of a new version of the Model 3, codenamed \"Highland,\" later this year. Additionally, the company is planning a styling change to the Model Y, codenamed \"Juniper,\" set to take effect next year.",

                    "body": "Investing.com -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock edged higher in premarket trading on Monday after the electric car maker announced fresh price cuts to some of its premium models.\n\nTesla's website indicated that the company had cut its price for the Model S by around 4% and the more expensive Model X by around 9%.\n\nThe move comes less than two months after Tesla's last round of discounting, in which it slashed prices for all its models by up to 20%. At the time, CEO Elon Musk had talked up the immediate impact of price cuts on demand.\n\nThat round of cuts ensured that the mass-market Model 3 would qualify for federal tax relief of up to $7,500. By contrast, the Model S and Model X are still priced well above the $55,000 threshold for tax credits. The basic price quoted on Tesla's website for the Model S is $89,990, while the Model X is priced at $99,990. That represents a cut of $5,000 for the Model S and $10,000 for the Model X.\n\nThe new price cuts are unlikely to do much to change the outlook for Tesla's bottom line, given the balance of its sales mix. While they were instrumental in building the Tesla brand, The Model S and Model X now account for less than 5% of vehicle deliveries from CEO Elon Musk's company.\n\nTesla edges up after fresh price cuts on Model S and Model X\n\nTesla is no longer a Top Pick auto stock at Morgan Stanley; replaced by Ferrari",

The company lowered prices of the higher-performance Plaid versions of each vehicle by 4.3% and 8.3%.\n\nAt $109,990, Plaid iterations of the S and X now cost $26,000 and $29,000 less than they did in early January.\n\n\u00a9 Bloomberg Tesla Model S and X Price Changes This Year | Breaking down the changes to each model\n\nMusk said last week that desire to own Teslas was \"indistinguishable from infinite,\" and that demand will \"go crazy\" as the company makes its cars more affordable. Reducing prices of S and the X models again suggests those vehicles may have gotten less of a boost from cuts the company made across its lineup seven weeks ago.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" Musk said during Tesla's March 1 investor day.\n\nTesla shares rose 0.5% as of 6 a.m. New York time Monday, before the start of regular trading. The stock has climbed 61% this year after plunging 65% in 2022.\n\n\u00a9 Photographer: Eric Thayer/Bloomberg Tesla Slashes Prices Up To 20% In Broad Bid To Boost Sales\n\nTesla's dynamic pricing is unique in the automotive world, where manufacturers typically only make changes to what they suggest their retailers charge from one model year to the next. Reductions to the Model 3 and Y in January made those vehicles cheaper relative to the average price of a new vehicle in the US than ever before.\n\nLoad Error\n\nRead more: Tesla Undercuts Average US Car by Almost $5,000 in EV Shakeout\n\nThe changes to the 3 and Y were at least in part driven by Tesla wanting those models to qualify for tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act. After the Biden administration changed how it distinguished between passenger cars and sport utility vehicles in early February, thereby raising the price limit for Model Ys to be eligibile for credits, Tesla bumped prices back up.\n\n(Updates with additional Musk comments beginning in the fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYellowstone Backers Wanted to Cash Out -- Then the Streaming Bubble BurstFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB SecretsFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the ExitsHow Countries Leading on Early Years of Child Care Get It RightMicrosoft Expands Game Pass as Regulators Fret Over Activision Deal\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

For the Model S, the entry-level model's price has dropped by 5 per cent to $89,990 while the price of the Model S Plaid has been reduced by 4 per cent to $109,990.\n\nAdditionally, prices of both variants of the Model X have been cut by $10,000. This means that the basic version of the all-electric SUV now starts at $99,990, a 9 per cent reduction, while the Model X Plaid can be picked up for $109,990, an 8 per cent reduction in price.\n\nRead: Tesla Recalls 363k Cars Over Full Self-Driving Beta's Potential To Cause A Crash\n\nThese price cuts come shortly after Tesla chief executive Elon Musk discussed the importance of cutting prices during the carmaker's recent Investor Day.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" he said. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nTesla triggered headlines in January when it announced even more substantial price cuts with a particular focus on the Model 3 and Model Y. Prices of the Model 3 sedan were slashed by as much as 14 per cent while the starting price for a Model Y fell by almost 20 per cent.\n\nThe car manufacturer continued to tweak prices throughout January and February. Indeed, in February, the price of the Model Y Performance jumped by $1,000 while the price of the Standard Range AWD was increased by $500.",

                    "body": "Tesla Inc. reduced prices of its more expensive models again, days after Elon Musk said cuts earlier this year had piqued interest in the company's electric vehicles.\n\nThe Model S and X now start at US$89,990 and US$99,990 in the U.S., down a respective 5.3 per cent and 9.1 per cent, according to Tesla's website. The company lowered prices of the higher-performance Plaid versions of each vehicle by 4.3 per cent and 8.3 per cent.\n\nAt US$109,990, Plaid iterations of the S and X now cost US$26,000 and US$29,000 less than they did in early January.\n\nMusk said last week that desire to own Teslas was \"indistinguishable from infinite,\" and that demand will \"go crazy\" as the company makes its cars more affordable. Reducing prices of S and the X models again suggests those vehicles may have gotten less of a boost from cuts the company made across its lineup seven weeks ago.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" Musk said during Tesla's March 1 investor day.\n\nTesla shares rose 0.5 per cent as of 6 a.m. New York time Monday, before the start of regular trading. The stock has climbed 61 per cent this year after plunging 65 per cent in 2022.\n\nTesla's dynamic pricing is unique in the automotive world, where manufacturers typically only make changes to what they suggest their retailers charge from one model year to the next. Reductions to the Model 3 and Y in January made those vehicles cheaper relative to the average price of a new vehicle in the U.S. than ever before.\n\nThe changes to the 3 and Y were at least in part driven by Tesla wanting those models to qualify for tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act. After the Biden administration changed how it distinguished between passenger cars and sport utility vehicles in early February, thereby raising the price limit for Model Ys to be eligibile for credits, Tesla bumped prices back up.",

                    "body": "Tesla continues to cut prices on its cars. The latest cuts were among its most expensive cars. The price war in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, which has begun only in the past few months, is accelerating. It is hard to see how that will not hurt margins. (Click here for the 13 biggest electric vehicle business failures in American history.)\n\nTesla reduced the price of its Model X by 9.1% to $99,990. That follows another cut from $120,990, which is where it was at the start of 2023. The company cut the price of its Model S by slightly less. The recent decrease took the price to $89,990, down from $104,990 before the start of the year.\n\nTesla has tried to calm investors by saying it has an extremely efficient system to make its cars. However, it cannot have made a quantum leap in efficiency in under 90 days. Even with industry-leading efficiency, its profit per vehicle must have fallen over that period.\n\nThe widely held belief about Tesla's plan is that the EV maker wants to hold market share, even at the cost of profit margins. Management says it could sell as many as 2 million cars this year. That will keep it well ahead of any car company in the world, based on total unit sales. However, the largest car companies have spent billions to move into the EV sector. Tesla does not have to deal with one or two manufacturers. It has to deal with over a dozen, each with a global sales network and massive sums of money for production, development and marketing.\n\nShort term, the companies that will be hurt the most are tiny manufacturers, some of which have impressive technology but weak balance sheets. This includes Lordstown, Lucid and Rivian. Price cuts and lower margins could ruin them quickly.",

The cuts come just days after Chief Executive Elon Musk said recent price cuts on other models had stoked demand.\n\nThese most recent price cuts are the automaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth adjustment since the start of the year, ranged from 4% on the performance version of the Model S to 9% on the more expensive Model X.\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.\n\nMusk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nShares of TSLA are up 0.02% in pre-market trading on Monday.",

It's the second time Tesla has cut prices on these vehicles in 2023.\n\nTesla has slashed the prices of its two most expensive vehicles for the second time in 2023 as it forges ahead with a price war.\n\nThe price of the Model S sedan has been lowered by $5,000 in the US, according to the company's website. The basic version now costs $89,990, down from $94,990, while the Plaid performance version now costs $109,990, down from $114,990.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the basic Model S cost $104,990 and the Plaid version, $135,990.\n\nThe Model X SUV, Tesla's most expensive vehicle, was just discounted by $10,000 in the US, according to the company's website. The basic version is now $99,990, down from $109,990, and the Plaid variant is $109,990, down from $119,990.\n\nBefore the first price cut of 2023, the basic Model X cost $120,990, and the Plaid version, $138,990.\n\nBYD, a Chinese competitor to Tesla, has suffered a sharp stock price decline since Tesla began cutting prices in 2023. Car-shopping website Edmunds said after the first round of price cuts that the move had lured buyers.\n\nAt Tesla's investor day Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk said: \"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nThe price cuts have been met with anger by some Tesla owners who purchased vehicles just before the discounts were introduced.\n\nThe earlier price cuts appeared to boost Tesla's sales. Musk said in an earnings call late January that orders for the company's vehicles were at their strongest ever. He added that it has always been Tesla's goal to produce cars that were \"affordable to as many people as possible.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside normal business hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

                    "body": "A Tesla Model X at a Tesla delivery center in Marina Del Rey, California, U.S., on Friday, Jan. 13, 2023.\n\nTesla Inc. reduced prices of its more expensive models again, days after Elon Musk said cuts earlier this year had piqued interest in the company's electric vehicles.\n\nThe Model S and X now start at $89,990 and $99,990 in the US, down a respective 5.3% and 9.1%, according to Tesla's website. The company lowered prices of the higher-performance Plaid versions of each vehicle by 4.3% and 8.3%.\n\nAt $109,990, Plaid iterations of the S and X now cost $26,000 and $29,000 less than they did in early January.\n\nMusk said last week that desire to own Teslas was \"indistinguishable from infinite,\" and that demand will \"go crazy\" as the company makes its cars more affordable. Reducing prices of S and the X models again suggests those vehicles may have gotten less of a boost from cuts the company made across its lineup seven weeks ago.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" Musk said during Tesla's March 1 investor day.\n\nTesla shares rose 0.5% as of 6 a.m. New York time Monday, before the start of regular trading. The stock has climbed 61% this year after plunging 65% in 2022.\n\nTesla's dynamic pricing is unique in the automotive world, where manufacturers typically only make changes to what they suggest their retailers charge from one model year to the next. Reductions to the Model 3 and Y in January made those vehicles cheaper relative to the average price of a new vehicle in the US than ever before.\n\nThe changes to the 3 and Y were at least in part driven by Tesla wanting those models to qualify for tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act. After the Biden administration changed how it distinguished between passenger cars and sport utility vehicles in early February, thereby raising the price limit for Model Ys to be eligibile for credits, Tesla bumped prices back up.",

                    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. reduced prices of its more expensive models again, days after Elon Musk said cuts earlier this year had piqued interest in the company's electric vehicles.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Model S and X now start at $89,990 and $99,990 in the US, down a respective 5.3% and 9.1%, according to Tesla's website. The company lowered prices of the higher-performance Plaid versions of each vehicle by 4.3% and 8.3%.\n\nAt $109,990, Plaid iterations of the S and X now cost $26,000 and $29,000 less than they did in early January.\n\nMusk said last week that desire to own Teslas was \"indistinguishable from infinite,\" and that demand will \"go crazy\" as the company makes its cars more affordable. Reducing prices of S and the X models again suggests those vehicles may have gotten less of a boost from cuts the company made across its lineup seven weeks ago.\n\n\"We found that even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand, very big,\" Musk said during Tesla's March 1 investor day.\n\nTesla shares rose 0.5% as of 6 a.m. New York time Monday, before the start of regular trading. The stock has climbed 61% this year after plunging 65% in 2022.\n\nTesla's dynamic pricing is unique in the automotive world, where manufacturers typically only make changes to what they suggest their retailers charge from one model year to the next. Reductions to the Model 3 and Y in January made those vehicles cheaper relative to the average price of a new vehicle in the US than ever before.\n\nRead more: Tesla Undercuts Average US Car by Almost $5,000 in EV Shakeout\n\nThe changes to the 3 and Y were at least in part driven by Tesla wanting those models to qualify for tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act. After the Biden administration changed how it distinguished between passenger cars and sport utility vehicles in early February, thereby raising the price limit for Model Ys to be eligibile for credits, Tesla bumped prices back up.\n\n(Updates with additional Musk comments beginning in the fourth paragraph.)",

Less than two months ago, in January, Tesla slashed prices across models in all markets by up to 20%, which made a host of vehicles more affordable and put them in a bracket that made them eligible for Biden's $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) subsidy.\n\n4%: Share of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022 represented by Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance \"Plaid\" editions. The rest came from its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover.\n\nAnalysts predicted that a demand shortage is what led to the reduction in prices at the start of this year. During a Twitter Spaces conversation, Tesla chief Elon Musk -- who is also the Twitter chief -- suggested that waning demand combined with high interest rates are a \"double whammy\" for the carmaker. Lower prices would ideally revive some of the appetite.\n\nThe electric carmaker earns more money on any vehicle it sells than its global rivals. Its drastic price cuts could mark the start of a price war -- one that would force competitors to curtail prices in the face of rising raw material costs and interest rates. China and other Asian markets had already witnessed two rounds of Tesla price cuts in recent months.\n\nThe price cuts risk alienating some customers. Tesla buyers who missed out on the deals protested the changes, feeling their vehicles lost value as a result of the discounts. Nearly 200 recent Model Y and 3 owners gathered at Tesla's Chinese showrooms and distribution centers after price hikes to the 3 and Y models in January to demand rebates. The outrage was also manifest in the US as customers lamenting missing out on the offer price even struggled to get a response from customer service.\n\n12-15%: How much Tesla's January price cuts could boost sales, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives\n\n$76,626 to $58,657: The average prices Teslas listed for in June 2022 versus January 2023\n\n60%: Drop in sales of competing domestic electric vehicle makers Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng in China in January, after Tesla dropped vehicle prices in the mainland by as much as 13.5%\n\nAt the start of this year, Tesla's China chief Tom Zhu was promoted to take direct oversight of Tesla's US assembly plants as well as sales, service, and deliveries in North America and Europe. He can likely apply his learnings from that market to the rest of the world.\n\nWith brand new Tesla's becoming significantly cheaper, the value of some used Teslas dropped by several thousand dollars overnight.\n\n\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd Tesla is the latest American manufacturer to invest in Mexico\n\n\ud83d\udd0e Elon Musk readies to unveil Tesla's third master plan at the company's first investor day",

Model S Plaid is now priced at $109,990, lower than $114,990 earlier.\n\nModel X all-wheel drive costs $99,990, down from $109,990 earlier, and Model X Plaid is now $109,990, lower than the previous price of $119,990.\n\nAmid slowing demand for electric vehicles, recession fears and higher interest rates, Tesla in January had reduced its electric vehicle prices in the United States and Europe, nearly a week after it slashed prices at its biggest international market in China.\n\nIn the U.S., the prices were cut on the Model 3 sedan, Model Y crossover SUV, Model X luxury crossover SUV and Model S sedan. In Germany, prices of Model 3 and the Model Y were cut. The vehicle prices were also reduced in Austria, Switzerland and France, as well as in South Korea, Japan, Australia and Singapore.\n\nMusk earlier had hinted that Tesla could lower prices of its vehicles to sustain volume growth. At the company's March 1 investor day, Chief Executive Elon Musk said the recent price cuts had improved demand of those particular models.\n\nMusk, at the event held at Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas, had said, \"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nTesla engineers added that the company would cut assembly costs by half in future generations of cars.\n\nDespite significant COVID and supply chain-related challenges throughout 2022, vehicle deliveries in the year grew 40 percent year-over-year to 1.31 million, while production grew 47 percent from a year ago to 1.37 million.\n\nTesla, whose largest individual shareholder is Musk, had lost much of its stock value last year due to a sell-off following Musk's $44 billion acquisition of troubled social media platform Twitter, along with weakness in tech market.\n\nHowever, with demand growth for its electric vehicles after the recent price cuts on several models, the car company has been showing strength recently amid the signs of economic recovery.\n\nFollowing the surge in the luxury electric car maker's stock price, Musk recently regained his title as the world's richest person, according to Bloomberg billionaires Index.\n\nIn its recent fourth quarter, Tesla's profit jumped around 59 percent to $3.7 billion, with a 37.2 percent rise in revenues to $24.32 billion.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com",

                    "body": "Writing about issues in certain vehicles enables other owners to be aware of what can affect their cars. It may also alert authorities about potential recalls. This work method has always helped me tell more stories, and Nickolas Catherine's is a good example. The 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD owner found me on LinkedIn to report another case of a failed rear motor inverter. Catherine experienced that after driving his brand-new Model 3 for only 126 miles. 10 photosPhoto: Nickolas Catherine \"Last Monday (February 27), I picked up my Tesla Model 3 and had no issues until I was driving home from work last Wednesday (March 1). The car essentially just shut down. The accelerator pedal just stopped, and I couldn't even brake. Luckily, the car rolled to a complete stop, eventually. Once the car stopped, I was unable to shift the car into drive or reverse: I was just stuck. Thank goodness my car was not on the road.\"\n\nThe Model 3 stopped on Ocean Heights Avenue in New Jersey. You can see the exact location on the embedded map below. Catherine called Tesla Roadside Assistance and was rescued by a tow truck only after two hours of waiting. The Model 3 was taken to the Cherry Hill Tesla Service Center. Talking to the technician there, the Tesla customer learned about what went wrong. Sadly, this is not the first case of a failed Power Conversion System (PCS), the inverter's fancy name.\n\nPhoto: Nickolas Catherine In April 2022, Tesla recalled 127,785 units of the Model 3 in China due to a rear motor inverter defect. That same month, ConsumerAffairs said the Model Y had a chronic flaw in the same component. In a quick search, I found that the oldest complaint about the issue dates back to November 19, 2020. And it was probably not the first such situation: Hansj\u00f6rg von Gemmingen said he replaced the drive unit in his Model S \"11 or 12\" times before reaching 1 million miles with it.\n\nThe rear motor in the Model S is different from the one used in the Model 3. However, the inverter may be the same or at least have similarities. The sure deal here is that the Model 3 and the Model Y share the same platform and most components, including the motors. That helps connect the defects in the SUV to those in the sedan.\n\nAlthough the Chinese Model 3 and the American one have no differences apart from one battery pack (LFP in China and NCA in the U.S. for the entry-level derivative), Tesla managed to avoid an American recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It just informed the safety regulator about it and kept business as usual. New cases kept on happening worldwide, such as those involving Dana Brems, Thomas George Exton, and Jamil Jutha. Add Nickolas Catherine to the list.\n\nPhoto: Nickolas Catherine The Cherry Hill Tesla Service Center staff also told him that he could pick up the EV as soon as it was fixed. Unlike all the other people I have written about with the same problem, Catherine said he would not drive it \"from the dealership or ever again.\" The Model 3 owner just wants his money back: if Tesla refuses to do so in a friendly way, he does not discard asking for legal help. Catherine is not willing to accept that a brand-new car can have such a failure.\n\n\"Some people have no issues and love Tesla. For everyone else, it's a nightmare. Really no in-between. And their customer service is horrible. They won't even let me speak to the manager in Tesla Cherry Hill because he's too scared to speak to me. Great leadership.\"\n\nPhoto: Nickolas Catherine Catherine's refusal to ever drive the Model 3 gives a fair idea of how he felt about the entire situation. He called the case \"a crapshoot on how your experience will turn out\" and assured me the EV maker would never see his money again.\n\n\"This is my first Tesla. I just got hired for a new job and needed a car for the commute since my current car is coming to the end of its lifespan. I also wanted to save money on gas since my commute is 100 miles round trip. I start a new job in a month that's 100 miles round trip, and I just can't rely on that car anymore to get me there. I believe in the future of electric cars still, but Tesla is setting EVs back by their behavior.\"\n\nTesla told him he could pick up his car this March 6. Despite his tight deadline to get his money back and buy a new ride, he does not intend to do so. It would be great to write about this and state that Tesla did the right thing for its customer. After all, the EV maker claims demand is not a problem: it should find a buyer for Catherine's car in the blink of an eye. Catherine promised to keep me posted, and I'll do the same for my readers. Let's see how this whole thing unfolds.",

The basic version now costs $89,990, down from $94,990, while the Plaid performance version now costs $109,990, down from $114,990.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the basic Model S cost $104,990 and the Plaid version, $135,990.\n\nThe Model X SUV, Tesla's most expensive vehicle, was just discounted by $10,000 in the US, according to the company's website. The basic version is now $99,990, down from $109,990, and the Plaid variant is $109,990, down from $119,990.\n\nBefore the first price cut of 2023, the basic Model X cost $120,990, and the Plaid version, $138,990.\n\nThe price cuts have been met with anger by some Tesla owners who purchased vehicles just before the discounts were introduced.\n\nThe earlier price cuts appeared to boost Tesla's sales. Musk said in an earnings call late January that orders for the company's vehicles were at their strongest ever. He added that it has always been Tesla's goal to produce cars that were \"affordable to as many people as possible.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside normal business hours.",

                    "body": "Tesla's two most expensive models in the US just got a little cheaper.\n\nThe basic and performance versions of the Model S and the pricier Model X have been slashed by between $5,000 and $10,000, according to the company's website.\n\nOnce a surprising move, price cuts are becoming more routine for the Texas-based automaker. Less than two months ago, in January, Tesla slashed prices across models in all markets by up to 20%, which made a host of vehicles more affordable and put them in a bracket that made them eligible for Biden's $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) subsidy.\n\nThe EV giant has adjusted prices of its cars both up and down at least five times this year already.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\" -- Elon Musk at Tesla's investor day on Mar. 2.\n\n4%: Share of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022 represented by Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance \"Plaid\" editions. The rest came from its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover.\n\nAnalysts predicted that a demand shortage is what led to the reduction in prices at the start of this year. During a Twitter Spaces conversation, Tesla chief Elon Musk -- who is also the Twitter chief -- suggested that waning demand combined with high interest rates are a \"double whammy\" for the carmaker. Lower prices would ideally revive some of the appetite.\n\nThe electric carmaker earns more money on any vehicle it sells than its global rivals. Its drastic price cuts could mark the start of a price war -- one that would force competitors to curtail prices in the face of rising raw material costs and interest rates. China and other Asian markets had already witnessed two rounds of Tesla price cuts in recent months.\n\nThe price cuts risk alienating some customers. Tesla buyers who missed out on the deals protested the changes, feeling their vehicles lost value as a result of the discounts. Nearly 200 recent Model Y and 3 owners gathered at Tesla's Chinese showrooms and distribution centers after price hikes to the 3 and Y models in January to demand rebates. The outrage was also manifest in the US as customers lamenting missing out on the offer price even struggled to get a response from customer service.\n\n12-15%: How much Tesla's January price cuts could boost sales, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives\n\n$76,626 to $58,657: The average prices Teslas listed for in June 2022 versus January 2023\n\n60%: Drop in sales of competing domestic electric vehicle makers Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng in China in January, after Tesla dropped vehicle prices in the mainland by as much as 13.5%\n\nAt the start of this year, Tesla's China chief Tom Zhu was promoted to take direct oversight of Tesla's US assembly plants as well as sales, service, and deliveries in North America and Europe. He can likely apply his learnings from that market to the rest of the world.\n\nWith brand new Tesla's becoming significantly cheaper, the value of some used Teslas dropped by several thousand dollars overnight.\n\n\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd Tesla is the latest American manufacturer to invest in Mexico\n\n\ud83d\udd0e Elon Musk readies to unveil Tesla's third master plan at the company's first investor day",

( Image Source : Getty )\n\nElon Musk-owned Tesla Inc has cut the prices of its electric vehicles (EVs) across its line-up in the US for the second time, which might be in an effort to boost sales before the end of the quarter. According to TechCrunch, the EV firm has lowered the prices of its Model S sedan and Model X SUV.\n\nThe Model S all-wheel drive is now available for $89,990, which is down 5.2 per cent or about $5,000 from $94,990, while the Model S Plaid is now at $1,09,990, down 4.3 per cent from $1,14,990, according to the report.\n\nIn addition, the Model X all-wheel drive is now available for $99,990, down 9.1 per cent or $10,000 from $109,990, while the Plaid is now priced at $1,09,990, down 8.3 per cent from $1,19,990, the report said.\n\nIn January, Tesla drastically lowered the prices of EVs across its line-up in the US and Europe, in an effort to boost sales as its stock plummeted more than 60 per cent. The least expensive EV, the Model 3 RWD, has dropped from $46,990 to $43,990, while the Model Y Long Range's price decreased 20 per cent from $65,990 to $52,990.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla, arguably the most popular EV-maker in the world, has been sued along with CEO Elon Musk by shareholders in the US over the company's safety claims on the cars' Full Self-Driving and Autopilot features. As reported by Reuters, shareholders in a proposed class action suit filed in a San Francisco federal court, claimed that Tesla has defrauded them over four years.\n\nTesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn and his predecessor Deepak Ahuja are also defendants.\n\nThe class action claimed that Tesla concealed how its technology \"created a serious risk of accident and injury\" with false and misleading statements. Tesla has been under the scanner for quite some time now due to several fatal crashes in the US.\n\nThe US National Highway Traffic Safety Administraion (NHTSA) have been investigating Tesla's self-driving claims, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was also investigating autopilot claims. Tesla's stock prices have been on a rollercoaster ride ever since news of false company claims started surfacing.",

                    "body": "After years of price increases, Tesla has updated pricing on its flagship Model S and Model X vehicles. The Model S now starts at just $90,000.\n\nOver the last few years, Tesla has gradually increased prices across its entire lineup amid supply chain difficulties and inflation, but also mainly due to enjoying some robust demand.\n\nThat finally changed in January when Tesla implemented price cuts across its entire vehicle lineup worldwide.\n\nSince then, the automaker has made some smaller price adjustments - primarily small increases to the Model Y and small price decreases to Model 3.\n\nNow in an overnight update to its online configurator, Tesla has slashed the price on Model S and Model X:\n\nThese are significant price reductions ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, depending on the model.\n\nHowever, these price cuts come after years of significant price increases on Model S and Model X following a design refresh 2 years ago.\n\nTesla had difficulties ramping up production of the new version of the vehicle - creating long wait times that the automaker took advantage of price-wise.\n\nWith the Model S now starting at $90,000, the price is basically back at the level it was in the summer of 2021.\n\nInterestingly, the Model S Plaid and the Model X Plaid are now the same price. It's not the first time it has happened, but it makes little to no sense as Tesla has generally kept the price of the bigger electric SUV higher than the sedan, which is still the case for the non-Plaid version by as much as $10,000.\n\nThese new price cuts come just as Tesla updated Model S and Model X recently. We noted that those are the first models to feature the new Hardware 4 Autopilot/Self-Driving suite of sensors and a new computer. Tesla also slightly updated the rear of the vehicles.\n\nAll Model S and Model X vehicles are built in Fremont, California, and they are shipped to all Tesla markets worldwide.",

The Model S Plaid is now $109,990, down 4.3 percent from $114,990. Te Model X all-wheel drive is now $99,990, down 9.1 percent from $109,990. The Model X Plaid is now $109,990, down 8.3 percent from $119,990.Tesla sells its cars direct to consumers and often tweaks its pricing. The latest moves come even though Tesla drastically cut prices in January in a broad bid to boost sales.\n\nAt the company's March 1 investor day, held at Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and other leaders emphasized manufacturing efficiency and cost cutting.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" said Musk. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"",

At the time, CEO Elon Musk had talked up the immediate impact of price cuts on demand.\n\nThat round of cuts ensured that the mass-market Model 3 would qualify for federal tax relief of up to $7,500. By contrast, the Model S and Model X are still priced well above the $55,000 threshold for tax credits. The basic price quoted on Tesla's website for the Model S is $89,990, while the Model X is priced at $99,990. That represents a cut of $5,000 for the Model S and $10,000 for the Model X.\n\nThe new price cuts are unlikely to do much to change the outlook for Tesla's bottom line, given the balance of its sales mix. While they were instrumental in building the Tesla brand, The Model S and Model X now account for less than 5% of vehicle deliveries from CEO Elon Musk's company.",

So was the market: the company's share price fell by 5pc after a \"four-hour slog\" that \"offered nothing much\", according to one business publication.\n\nNo new models were revealed, nor were eagerly awaited production dates or prices disclosed. Even the rock star chief executive himself, Elon Musk, was much more muted and low profile than in previous years\n\nIt was dull for a reason: the Chinese are coming, bringing cheap electric cars to Western markets, potentially in huge quantities. They may have unpronounceable names, like \"Aiways\", and corny marketing slogans (\"bring your own dreams!\"), but they are fulfilling demand for cheaper EVs, which are what the sector is crying out for as demand stalls.\n\nAs the electric car market leader, Tesla has never done affordable, nor has it really ever cracked reliable high volume production.\n\nIn an effort to convince shareholders it can, and see off the Chinese threat in the process, almost half of the investor day was devoted to the nerdy minutiae of car production line engineering, details that would bore even the most hardcore fans.\n\nTesla was trying to tell us that it can do cheap mass production. Having produced more than one million cars last year, it now wants to make 20 million vehicles a year by 2030.\n\nBut making a reliable mass market car is very different to the kind of trailblazing manufacturing that has made the company's name. It will require a huge cultural shift.\n\nMusk has already proved he can do reliable and cheap - space freight haulage company SpaceX has transformed the cost of launching payloads into orbit.\n\nBut cars are very different. The established manufacturers relish being safe and dull, putting their cleverest innovations in the factory, rather than in vehicles.\n\nEver since Henry Ford, the sector has been geared towards reliable and affordable mass production. Today, the auto industry boasts the world's most advanced industrial robotics and the most complex supply chains. Toyota's kaizen, or continual improvement, has spilled out into other fields, such as government.\n\nIn all this, the cars are almost an afterthought. That's evident from the uniformity of design that we see today: cars are based on a tiny number of \"platforms\", or set designs - the very embodiment of risk aversion.\n\nWith Tesla, Elon Musk injected Silicon Valley's \"move fast and break things\" culture into the auto industry. He demanded very rapid development that was extremely risky.\n\nIn addition to now targeting a 15-fold increase in volume, Tesla says it wants to achieve a 50pc reduction in cost. It's going about both challenges in its own typically risky way.\n\nFor a start, Tesla is going to be developing as much technology as it can internally, rather than relying on others. In addition, it's betting on the modular approach of creating larger, complex parts that can be bolted together easily, an approach called sub assembly. But both strategies increase risk significantly.\n\nThe established industry is horizontal: car makers farm out as much of the work to contractors and partners, keep inventories lean, and focus on the final assembly instead.\n\nTesla is the opposite, with a highly vertically integrated system. It has its own dealers and charging network, and its own gigafactories.\n\nBecoming more vertically integrated will help it discover cost savings, it argues. That could be true, but if a \u00a31 part doesn't work, then it's much faster and cheaper to find a replacement than it is to replace a complex \u00a3300 sub assembly module. Halting the production line when the market expects more than 50,000 finished working cars a day will be catastrophic. It may well write off the entire financial quarter, or even year.\n\n\"For people who know how production lines work - for people who never deal with physical things and only deal with virtual things - all this sounds novel, but it isn't,\" one expert told me. \"Elon Musk views risk in a different way to everyone else.\"\n\nThat's reflected in many of the stories recounted by the author and journalist Edward Niedermeyer in his book 'Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors'. Engineers and managers who wanted to slow down development, and factor in risk, were overruled or fired.\n\nSo far, Tesla has been blessed. Its early models were sold to extremely rich customers who already had several cars, and were happy to bask in the halo of prestige that Tesla conferred. Musk even slapped down those who complained, once deriding George Clooney for protesting that his Tesla was almost always broken down. Devoted fans took recalls in their stride. But as prices fall, reliability becomes much more important to the consumer.\n\nMusk has also been fortunate in that the established industry was slow to adapt and clumsy, too. A month ago, Ford chief executive Jim Farley admitted that each Mustang Mach-E electric car contained a mile of extra wiring that it didn't actually need, adding an extra $300 to its price tag. A whole mile? Yet the incumbents are learning and may catch up fast.\n\nCheap mass production is a tall order. Tesla has plenty to deal with already, consistently over-promising and under-delivering its autopilot capabilities. It has just been forced to upgrade over 360,000 cars because the United States' national road safety agency the NHTSA found its Full Self Driving (FSD) to be unsafe.\n\nAll car makers have reliability issues, and Tesla is not the worst. But can Elon Musk learn to be dull, reliable and dependable - everything he is not today? The future of Tesla depends on it.",

                    "body": "Tesla's Gigafactories in Texas, Germany, and China have helped it accelerate production\n\nTesla is celebrating the production of its 4 millionth model with the milestone being reached just 7 months after it produced its 3 millionth vehicle.\n\nDuring its recent Investor Day, the electric car manufacturer noted that it took it 12 years to build its first million vehicles. Thanks to the launch of the Model 3 in 2018, it took Tesla 18 months to build its 2 millionth car and then a further 11 months to build its 3 millionth vehicle.\n\nDriveTeslaCanada notes that Tesla's current production rate equals approximately 142,000 cars per month or 1.7 million vehicle annually. Beyond demand for Tesla models jumping in recent years, Gigafactories in Texas, Berlin, and Shanghai have allowed the carmaker to rapidly increase production.\n\nRead: Nevada Cuts Tesla A $330 Million Dollar Tax Break\n\nOf course, Tesla still has a long way to go if it hopes to achieve Elon Musk's goal of building 20 million vehicles annually by 2030. Musk has previously said that the car manufacturer will need approximately 12 Gigafactories to achieve that goal.\n\nTesla celebrated the 4 million milestone by releasing a short video of its employees in Texas clapping and cheering.\n\nBeyond planning to establish a host of new Gigafactories around the world, Tesla intends on spending $3.6 billion in Nevada to expand its existing Gigafactory with new facilities to build the Tesla Semi as well as its 4680 battery cells. The Governor's Office of Economic Development recently voted to approve a $330 million tax abatement over 20 years for Tesla, consisting of a 100 per cent reduction in property taxes and Modified Business tax for a decade and a 20-year reduction in the Sales and Use Tax rate from 7.6 per cent to 5.35 per cent.",

                    "body": "The truck driver jumped out and proceeded to blame the Model 3 owner who then explained that he had video footage of the crash.\n\nA Tesla Model 3 owner was driving up to a toll booth when a box truck crashed into his car. The box truck driver reportedly jumped out of the truck and tried to blame the Tesla driver for the incident. However, the Tesla owner, whose name is Matt, made it clear that the car had recorded the crash with its built-in camera system. The drivers then waited for the police to arrive at the scene.\n\nAs the story goes, a New Jersey state trooper arrived just a few minutes after the collision occurred. Matt showed the officer the TeslaCam footage that was recorded and saved by the Tesla Model 3. Regardless of the evidence, the officer told Matt that he would still have to conduct a full investigation, which would take up to 15 days.\n\nThe Tesla owner received a copy of the police report 17 days later. Interestingly, it said that they couldn't decide who was at fault in the accident, so each driver would be held 50% responsible. The report revealed that the box truck driver merged without using a turn signal and that Matt had also merged at the same time. Since Matt was merging as well, he was considered at least partly at fault.\n\nThe repair bill for the Tesla was a whopping seven pages long. The total came to a shocking $30,000 (approx. \u00a325,000).\n\nCheck out the video above to see the repair bill and other related details. In addition, there are 19 other TeslaCam stories in the video after Matt's story.",

                    "body": "Tesla's US website shows that the Model S and Model X EVs are dropping their prices in the latest announcement.\n\nThe price cuts came after the company's CEO Elon Musk said that people should not be limited in their ability to purchase their desired Tesla vehicle.\n\nAccording to a report by TechCrunch on Monday, March 6, Tesla announced a new list for the pricing of its Model S and Model X cars in the US this year.\n\nFor the second time, the world's largest EV manufacturer reduced the prices of its SUV and sedan as part of attracting more buyers to purchase these models.\n\nCertainly, Tesla does not want people to overlook these models given how competitive the EV market is nowadays. With new units produced every year, the old variants are often treated as the second option of the customers.\n\nAt the time, the Model S all-wheel drive was currently available at $89,990. A price drop of $5,000 or 5.2% might be enough for some buyers to opt for this model given how expensive it was at its original price of $94,990.\n\nMeanwhile, the Model S Plaid is down to $109,990 from its former price of $114,990, a sharp drop of 4.3%.\n\nOn the other hand, interested buyers who want to purchase the Model X all-wheel drive should prepare $99,990 for this deal. It's quite a steal for struggling customers who can't buy this at $109,990 before.\n\nIf you want a more improved Model X SUV, you can go for its Plaid edition this time at a cheaper price of $109,990 from its original price of $119,990.\n\nFor the past months, Elon Musk repeatedly mentioned that Tesla needs to consider dropping the prices of its EVs in a bid to drive demand and sales from the market.\n\nEarlier this year, the company saw early success in its business as it recorded huge orders for buyers.\n\nDuring Tesla's Investor Day last Wednesday, March 1, Musk highlighted the need to de-limit the paying ability of the people who want to own a Tesla car, per Reuters.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said during the event.\n\nRelated Article: Used Tesla EV Prices Dropping at Fast Rates! Here's How To Buy 2nd-hand Electric Cars\n\nWhen Tesla announced in 2021 that it would accept Bitcoin as payment for electric vehicles, people assumed that the company would fully embrace crypto payment as an alternative.\n\nHowever, Tech Times reported that there was a time when the company stopped accepting $BTC as payment because of environmental concerns.\n\nThis year, Adidas said that Tesla served as an inspiration for it to embrace Web3, per Benzinga.\n\nThe apparel firm said that it was inspired by Tesla's move to accept Bitcoin as payment for EV purchases.",

                    "body": "Earlier in the year, Tesla was thought to have a demand problem, which it solved by slashing prices across the board. However, Tesla also slashed the Model S and Model X prices on March 5, despite inventories consistently dropping. The move might have been prompted by different reasons this time. 6 photosPhoto: Tesla | Edited The end of 2023 brought us a surprising change of strategy at Tesla. After years of consistently increasing prices, the EV maker has operated its first price reduction. The timing coincided with reports about Tesla's burgeoning inventories, a trend that had investors worried that the EV carmaker might face a demand problem.\n\nDemand is not something you can measure in itself but also in relation to market conditions, pricing strategy, etc. As Elon Musk famously said during the 2023 Investor Day, the demand is infinite, but people just can't afford a Tesla. It may have sounded funny, but it's true: drop the prices, and the demand jumps. Considering the fat profit margins Tesla has on its vehicle, it is certainly in a position to play with the prices to set the demand where it suits it.\n\nAnd that's exactly what it did in January when Tesla announced massive price cuts for its entire lineup. Back then, the Model and Model X saw the biggest discounts, up to $21,000 in the case of the Model S Plaid. The demand picked up speed, and the inventories started to deplete. The Model S stock in the U.S. dropped from over 500 cars in February to around 100 in March, roughly at November 2022 levels.\n\nThat's why cutting the prices even further is puzzling, considering the inventory's downward trend. In another swift move, Tesla cut the Model S AWD price to $89,990 (from $94,990) and the Model X AWD to $99,990 (from $109,990). Model S Plaid and Model X Plaid retail at $109,990 now, down from $114,990 and $119,990, respectively. Tesla also reduced the Model X starting prices in Canada by 7,000 CAD for both variants.\n\nThe fact that Tesla didn't operate similar changes for the Model 3 and Model Y might indicate that the price cuts are specifically targeted at the recently refreshed models in its lineup. The most likely reason is to clear up existing inventories for the updated models. Tesla is already producing Model S and Model X with the new Hardware 4 computer and sensor suite, and it probably wants old vehicles moved as fast as possible.\n\nBased on recent reports on social media channels, Tesla has already delivered cars with the new hardware. This conflicts with the idea of getting rid of old cars in inventory. If Tesla still had HW3 vehicles, delivering those first would have made more sense. So that brings us to the second reason: Tesla has increased Model S/X production and wants to drive up demand for its top-of-the-line models. This also gives Lucid a warning call, considering it already struggled to compete with Tesla at January prices.\n\nFinally, there could be a third reason for the Sunday price cuts. The improved production and savings from manufacturing and supply chain optimizations would allow Tesla to pass on savings to consumers. Still, Tesla never cared much about that, so take this with a grain of salt. What do you think is the reason Tesla slashed Model S and Model X prices?",

                    "body": "Volkswagen New MOVE Special-edition Models Announced Plus \u20ac2,600 Customer...\n\nTesla Inc has reduced the prices of two of its most expensive electric vehicles, Model S and Model X, in the United States. This is Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year. It ranges from 4 percent on the performance version of the Model S to 90 percent on the Model X.\n\nIn recent months, Elon Musk has said that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to push up demand. It has seen fruit with an increase in orders. At Tesla's investor day last week, Musk said the desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. He acknowledged that the limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\n\nIn January, the company cut prices on its EVs across all of its markets. Tesla offered discounts of up to 20 percent, igniting what market watchers called a price war.\n\nIt should be noted that the prices of Model S and Model X represented about 4 percent of the company's global deliveries in 2022. The Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, Tesla's two cheaper models, made up the rest. Moreover, the company's portal highlighted that it had also slashed prices of both versions of its Model S by $5,000, and the basic model of Model S was reduced by 5 percent to $89,990; the Plaid variant was reduced by 4 percent to $109,990.\n\nThere was a $10,000 reduction in prices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars, the basic AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9 percent to $99,990 and the Plaid version saw an 8 percent cut to $109,990.\n\nThe price cut may boost Tesla shares which have surged 60 percent year to date. But it is still down about 30 percent over the past 12 months.",

The Model S, meanwhile, has fallen from $104,990 to $89,990 since January 1st -- a steep $15,000 reduction.\n\nNeither car qualifies for Federal Tax rebates set to expire later this month, as those only apply to SUVs priced below $80,000 and cars under $55,000. Still, they're likely to push many fence-sitters over the edge. That tracks with what CEO Elon Musk said on Tesla Investor's Day, that \"the desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high... [but] the limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nMost Model 3 and Y vehicles do qualify for the rebates, thanks to Tesla's January price cuts on those EVs. (As a reminder, it's a \"nonrefundable\" tax credit, so you'll only benefit if you have a federal tax liability of at least $7,500.) After mid-March, however, the rules will change and many EVs that currently qualify may become ineligible.",

                    "body": "By Maria Merano Posted on March 5, 2023\n\nTesla reduced the price of the Model S and Model X in the United States. Based on the company's configuration page, Tesla reduced the Model S and Model X prices between $5,000 to $10,000.\n\nThe base Model S sedan now costs $89,990, while the Plaid version starts at $109,990. Previously, the base Model S was priced at $94,990, while the Plaid used to cost $114,990.\n\nTesla also reduced the price of its premium Model X SUV by $10,000. The base Model X now costs $99,990, and the Plaid Model X costs $109,990. Before the price reduction, the base Model X cost $109,990 while the Plaid version started at $119,990.\n\nThe current price cut marks the second time Tesla has reduced Model S and Model X prices in the United States since the beginning of 2023. In January, Tesla reduced the price of the Dual Motor AWD Model S sedan to $94,990 from $104,990. The Model S Plaid's price was also reduced from $135,990 to $114,990. At the time, the base Model X's price was cut from $120,990 to $109,990. While the Plaid Model X's price was reduced from $138,990 to $119,990.\n\nAround the same period, Tesla also reduced Model 3 and Model Y vehicle prices. Time will tell if the company will follow the same pattern for the current price reductions.\n\nSome reports claim that Tesla's recent price cuts are a bid to boost sales at the end of the first quarter. Tesla's recent price reductions seem to be a natural result of the work it put into developing its electric vehicle lineup. During Investor Day 2023, Tesla executives talked a lot about the in-house technology their teams are developing and their constant push to be more efficient. Tesla's recent price reduction appears to reflect its teams' efforts.\n\nCurrently, the Dual Motor AWD Model X's estimated delivery time is March to May 2023. While the Model X Plaid's delivery estimates reach all the way to April 2023. The Model X SUVs with May and April delivery dates will not be included in Tesla's Q1 2023 delivery results. Model S deliveries would likely contribute more to Tesla's delivery numbers at the end of the first quarter. The base Model S and Plaid Model S have estimated delivery dates in March 2023.\n\nWhat do you think about Tesla's recent price cuts? I'd like to hear you theory.

                    "body": "What Happened: Updated price information on Tesla's website showed price reductions in the range of 4.4%-9.1% for the Model X crossover SUV and the Model S liftback sedan.\n\nHere are details of the price changes for these premium models of the Austin Texas-based company:\n\nWhy It's Important: The most recent price cuts come on the heels of a previous round of cuts announced in early January when the prices of all the models and trims were reduced. The January cuts for the Model S and Model X cars ranged from 9.09% to 15.44%.\n\nIncidentally, after taking down prices of its Model 3 and Y vehicles in January, Tesla raised the prices of the rear-wheel drive variant of the Model 3 sedan and both the trims of the Model Y SUV.\n\nA tweet shared by Troy Teslike, a Twitter user who tracks estimates for Tesla, said that the EV maker lowered prices of unsold cars in Europe by 6%. Sharing screenshots of pricing in Germany, France and the U.K., he said these vehicles were imported ones from China.\n\nTesla can afford to bring down the prices of its vehicles without hurting margins due to the drivetrain efficiency it has achieved,\n\nThe cuts will also likely help to stimulate the demand for electric vehicles, which sagged in 2022 amid trying economic conditions.\n\nTesla closed Friday's session up 3.61% at $197.79, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next: Tesla Recalls 3,470 Model Y Vehicles And A Software Update Won't Resolve The Issue",

The Model S Plaid is now US$109,990, down 4.3 per cent from US$114,990.\n\nThe Model X all-wheel drive is now US$99,990, down 9.1 per cent from US$109,990. The Model X Plaid is now US$109,990, down 8.3 per cent from US$119,990.\n\nTesla sells its cars direct to consumers and often tweaks its pricing. The latest moves come even though Tesla drastically cut prices in January in a broad bid to boost sales.\n\nAt the company's March 1 investor day, held at Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas, chief executive officer Elon Musk and other leaders emphasized manufacturing efficiency and cost cutting.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" said Mr Musk. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\" BLOOMBERG",

                    "body": "Tesla slashed prices on its cars across all of its markets in January up to 20%.\n\nTesla Inc has cut prices on its two most expensive electric vehicles in the United States, according to the company's website, days after Chief Executive Elon Musk said recent price cuts on other models had stoked demand.\n\nThe price cuts, Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year, ranged from 4% on the performance version of the Model S to 9% on the more expensive Model X.\n\nElon Musk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the most recent price cuts.\n\nTesla slashed prices on its cars across all of its markets in January, offering discounts of up to 20% in what many analysts saw as the start of a price war by the electric vehicle market leader.\n\nIt has been adjusting prices since with a pace and frequency that goes beyond what established automaker's have attempted in an industry where a car's base price is still referred to as a \"sticker price\" on a vehicle in inventory.\n\nThe Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance \"Plaid\" editions, represented about 4% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. Its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, made up the rest.\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nTesla has a new version of the Model 3 codenamed \"Highland\" scheduled to go into production later this year and a change to the Model Y codenamed \"Juniper\" for next year, Reuters has reported.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nFeatured Video Of The DayAmitabh Bachchan Injured On Set In Hyderabad: \"Movement And Breathing Painful\"",

                    "body": ":Tesla Inc has cut prices on its two most expensive electric vehicles in the United States, according to the company's website, days after Chief Executive Elon Musk said recent price cuts on other models had stoked demand.\n\nThe price cuts, Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year, ranged from 4 per cent on the performance version of the Model S to 9 per cent on the more expensive Model X.\n\nMusk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the most recent price cuts.\n\nTesla slashed prices on its cars across all of its markets in January, offering discounts of up to 20 per cent in what many analysts saw as the start of a price war by the electric vehicle market leader.\n\nIt has been adjusting prices since with a pace and frequency that goes beyond what established automaker's have attempted in an industry where a car's base price is still referred to as a \"sticker price\" on a vehicle in inventory.\n\nThe Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance \"Plaid\" editions, represented about 4 per cent of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. Its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, made up the rest.\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5 per cent to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4 per cent to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9 per cent to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8 per cent to $109,990.\n\nTesla has a new version of the Model 3 codenamed \"Highland\" scheduled to go into production later this year and a change to the Model Y codenamed \"Juniper\" for next year, Reuters has reported.",

                    "body": "(Reuters) -Tesla Inc has cut prices on its two most expensive electric vehicles in the United States, according to the company's website, days after Chief Executive Elon Musk said recent price cuts on other models had stoked demand.\n\nThe price cuts, Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year, ranged from 4% on the performance version of the Model S to 9% on the more expensive Model X.\n\nMusk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the most recent price cuts.\n\nTesla slashed prices on its cars across all of its markets in January, offering discounts of up to 20% in what many analysts saw as the start of a price war by the electric vehicle market leader.\n\nIt has been adjusting prices since with a pace and frequency that goes beyond what established automaker's have attempted in an industry where a car's base price is still referred to as a \"sticker price\" on a vehicle in inventory.\n\nThe Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance \"Plaid\" editions, represented about 4% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. Its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, made up the rest.\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.\n\nTesla has a new version of the Model 3 codenamed \"Highland\" scheduled to go into production later this year and a change to the Model Y codenamed \"Juniper\" for next year, Reuters has reported.\n\n(Reporting by Mrinmay Dey and Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru; writing by Kevin Krolicki, Editing by Kim Coghill, Bradley Perrett and Sonali Paul)",

                    "body": "Tesla Inc has cut prices on its two most expensive electric vehicles in the United States, according to the company's website, days after Chief Executive Elon Musk said recent price cuts on other models had stoked demand.\n\nThe price cuts, Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year, ranged from 4% on the performance version of the Model S to 9% on the more expensive Model X.\n\nMusk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the most recent price cuts.\n\nTesla slashed prices on its cars across all of its markets in January, offering discounts of up to 20% in what many analysts saw as the start of a price war by the electric vehicle market leader.\n\nIt has been adjusting prices since with a pace and frequency that goes beyond what established automaker's have attempted in an industry where a car's base price is still referred to as a \"sticker price\" on a vehicle in inventory.\n\nThe Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance \"Plaid\" editions, represented about 4% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. Its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, made up the rest.\n\nTesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.\n\nTesla has a new version of the Model 3 codenamed \"Highland\" scheduled to go into production later this year and a change to the Model Y codenamed \"Juniper\" for next year, Reuters has reported.",

                    "body": "Tesla Model 3 has truly stamped the EV-maker's dominance in the world of clean personal mobility.\n\nWhat's shocking about the latest incident involving the Tesla Model 3 is the repair bill the owner of the EV received. The car owner has been slapped with a long seven-page repair bill for the damages costing a whopping $30,000, which appears insane.\n\nAlso Read : Porsche, Ferrari stand between EU and its aim to kill combustion engine\n\nThe Teslacam footage posted by the YouTube channel Wham Bam Teslacam shows how the car was struck by a large truck when the EV owner was driving up to a toll booth. The box truck driver reportedly humped out of the truck and tried to blame the Tesla owner for the accident. However, the Tesla owner clarified that the car's camera had recorded the crash.\n\nAs the story goes, the New Jersey state trooper arrived at the accident scene just a few minutes after the incident. When the Tesla owner showed the police officer the Teslacam footage, the officer reportedly said he would still have to conduct a full investigation, which would take up to 15 days.\n\nThe video claims that the Tesla owner received a copy of the police report 17 days later, which didn't conclude who was at fault in the accident. Instead, each driver was held 50 per cent responsible for the crash. The police report also revealed that the box truck driver merged without using a turn signal, and the Tesla driver merged simultaneously. As the Tesla Model 3 was merging, its driver was considered at least partly at fault.",

Prices for the Model X SUV were slashed by $10,000, with the basic version now costing $99,990, down from $109,990, and the Plaid version at $109,990, down from $119,990.\n\nIn January, Tesla, cut prices on its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. While that raised some concerns on Wall Street of sagging demand and lower margins, Piper Sandler analysts said the move could succeed in boosting sales and increasing its market share.\n\nLast week, Tesla held its annual investor day and executives said the electric-vehicle maker was determined to cut manufacturing costs and prices for consumers. \"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Chief Executive Elon Musk said, according to a FactSet transcript.\n\nTesla shares TSLA have surged 60% year to date, but are still down about 30% over the past 12 months, compared to the SP 500's SPX 5% gain in 2023 and 6.5% decline over the past year.",

                    "body": "Tesla Inc has cut prices of its Model S and Model X vehicles in the United States, its website showed, days after chief executive Elon Musk said recent price cuts of other models had stoked demand.\n\nPrices of Tesla's Model S cars were cut by $5,000. The basic version of Model S would now cost $89,990, down from $94,990 before, while its performance variant would cost $109,990, from $114,990 earlier.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The basic version would now cost $99,990 while its performance Plaid version would now cost $109,990.\n\nMusk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.\n\nInvestor Day Presentation Last Week\n\nLast week, a Tesla Investor Day presentation had teased the arrival of cheaper Tesla cars. Tesla engineers told investors that the cost of future Tesla cars would be nearly halved, making the brand affordable to more people and keeping competition at bay.\n\nAccording to an AP report, investors were told that the changes in the works would mean that the cost of a new generation Tesla vehicle could start from as low as around $25,000.\n\nAt one point during the presentation, Musk pointed out that though demand for Tesla vehicles is large, many buyers can't afford them.\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" the chief executive added.\n\nTesla also unveiled a plan to establish a plant in Mexico, which would the electric car pioneer's only plant outside the US, Germany and China.\n\nHuge New Investment\n\nTesla chief financial officer Zach Kirkhorn said the plan is to invest a whopping $175 billion in order to increase car output to 20 million vehicles annually by 2030. Currently, the annual vehicle turnout from Tesla factories is about 2 million vehicles.\n\nThe company's plan to set up a factory in Mexico aligned with the expectations that Tesla maybe planning to roll out small electric cars. Downsizing the starting models will be one of the means to penetrate the burgeoning electric vehicle market, which is seeing intense competition in markets across the world.\n\n'Huge Tease'\n\nBig shot Tesla investor Ross Gerber said the presentation clearly showed the future course of action from Tesla. \"It's coming. They laid it all out. 50% less cost to build. Would get you a $25-$30k EV!\", he tweeted, adding that the presentation was a 'huge tease\" on the next-generation models.\n\nAnalysts also point out that many automakers launch plants in Mexico where smaller cars are built. However, Musk and other Tesla executives did not give away much information on the new plans and as to when the smaller and cheaper cars would be rolled out.\n\nTesla shares fell more than 5 percent following the investor day presentation, probably because of the lack of clarity on the future course of action.",

This is the second time this year that Tesla has slashed prices, and it might be a bid to boost sales before the end of the quarter.\n\nThe Model S all-wheel drive is now available for $89,990, which is down 5.2% or about $5,000 from $94,990. The Model S Plaid is now $109,990, down 4.3% from $114,990.\n\nThe Model X all-wheel drive is going for $99,990, down 9.1% or $10,000 from $109,990. The Plaid is now $109,990, down 8.3% from $119,990.\n\nThe latest price cut comes after Tesla drastically slashed prices in January, making it at least the fifth time the automaker has reduced the cost of its vehicles in the past several months. Last week at Tesla's investor day, held at the company's Austin factory, CEO Elon Musk and other leaders discussed the importance of efficient manufacturing and cost cutting.\n\n\"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\" said Musk. \"The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\"\n\nTesla Models 3 and Y are still available for the $7,500 federal tax incentive in the U.S. for the rest of this month.",

The basic version of Model S would now cost $89,990 from $94,990 before, while its performance variant would cost $109,990 from $114,990 earlier.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed.\n\n(This story has been corrected to say Model S and not Model Y in the headline)\n\n(Reporting by Mrinmay Dey and Shubham Kalia; Editing by Kim Coghill in Bengaluru)",

                    "body": "Another year, another Tesla event where the cheap model isn't revealed. Where is it?\n\nTesla has been promising an affordable mass-market EV for years. First it was a vague $US30,000 (about $41,646) concept, then the mythical $US35,000 (about $48,587) Model 3, and then the $US25,000 (about $34,705) model without a steering wheel or pedals.\n\nThe affordable Tesla has been a no-show at Tesla's events for years. A cheaper upcoming model was briefly mentioned at Tesla's 2023 Investor Day event, as it was predicted to be revealed on the day, but nothing solid was locked in. There was lots of description of minimised production costs and changes to the supply chain and assembly line, but nothing about how that will or won't translate to cost savings for customers. Two Tesla designers specifically said the company wouldn't be unveiling its next-generation model at the event, and offered that it instead would be revealed at an unspecified later date.\n\nWith the exception of the entry-level Model 3's incredibly brief run, Tesla doesn't exactly seem eager to follow through on any of these budget-minded promises. Why not? Where is the mythical 'Tesla Model 2'?\n\nHere's a timeline of its past.\n\nBack in 2009, the only Tesla car to be found on actual roads was the original (and recently introduced) Roadster, built using a chassis provided by legendary auto-company Lotus. A prototype of the Model S had been revealed, but the final version wouldn't reach customers for another three years. The Models X, 3, and Y were but a glimmer in the eye of a certain emerald enthusiast. Tesla was a tiny, niche automaker.\n\nBy 2014, that entry-level sedan had gained a name: the Model 3, which has become the staple entry-level Tesla. With the announcement, its price point was bumped up to the famed $US35,000 ($48,587) MSRP that grabbed so many headlines. Maybe Tesla was just accounting for inflation since that initial 2009 announcement, or maybe the cost of batteries hadn't come down as far as Musk expected.\n\nSurely, though, after all those years of talking about a budget model, the new car would actually exist at that price point. After the company took in hundreds of thousands of preorders, each with a hefty price tag, there's no way it could turn around and barely offer the car everyone ordered. Right?\n\nA Forbes contributor wrote that, according to a chart shown at the 2023 investor event, the 'cheaper' Tesla would cost only 71 per cent of the Model 3's price, but obviously like with all things Tesla, take it with a grain of salt.\n\nTesla's record with promising budget models is a lot stronger than its record for actually delivering them. So when the company announces a $US25,000 ($34,705) budget model only to say it isn't actually going to be built, it's hard to be disappointed.\n\nThis isn't to say that Tesla won't ever make a cheap car, but for the moment, it's probably not a priority. After all, Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y remain the best-selling electric vehicles in Australia and other markets, although while they're leading numbers on adoption, several competitors are undercutting that price point.\n\nHeck, with the number of price drops Teslas have gotten over the past two years, maybe the Model 3 will end up being the 'cheap' model after all.\n\nIf you're interested in buying an EV in Australia, here's what incentives apply to you. Additionally, here's what is available and what's coming.",

                    "title": "Cheaper EVs ahead, but Musk won't give details",
                    "body": "Tesla will cut assembly costs by half in future generations of its cars, engineers told investors on Wednesday, but CEO Elon Musk did not reveal when it will debut a much-awaited affordable electric vehicle.\n\nMore than a dozen Tesla executives led by Musk discussed everything from a white-paper plan for the globe to embrace sustainable energy to the company's innovation in managing its operations from manufacturing to service.\n\nThe presentation featured an array of senior engineers, including the new global production chief, Tom Zhu, a nod to Tesla's attempt to show the depth of its top bench beyond Musk, the face of the company.\n\nBut there were no details about when next-generation cars would be launched and what would be offered. Musk had been expected to lay out a plan to make a cheaper EV that would broaden his brand's appeal and fend off competition.\n\nExecutives said Tesla's next-generation platform would include more than one vehicle built in standardized factories, but Musk brushed off questions about the models in mind.\n\nTesla's CFO Zachary Kirkhorn and others underscored their dedication to cutting production costs.\n\nKirkhorn estimated Tesla must invest six times more than it has to date to hit its long-term target of increasing output to 20 million vehicles annually by 2030, a 10-fold increase from current capacity. The bill could be $175 billion, he said.\n\nThe next investment step will be a new Tesla factory in northern Mexico, Musk said, announcing the first plant outside the United States, Germany and China.\n\nMusk did not comment on plans to revamp the Model Y sedan in 2024 or a revamped version of its Model 3 sedan, which will go into production in September.\n\nCapturing the mass market is critical to Tesla's annual production goal, which is more than the combined production of the two largest volume vehicle makers, Germany's Volkswagen and Japan's Toyota.\n\nIt would also represent a sales volume for Tesla of about a quarter of 2022's total global car sales.\n\nMusk said the key to driving Tesla's sales volume would be bringing prices down for consumers, adding that Tesla's discounts offered this year had stoked demand. \"The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,\" he said.\n\nTesla is the most valuable automaker, but its stock has swung wildly. Shares are down about half from their November 2021 peak but have rebounded more than 60 percent this year.\n\nMusk said Tesla could need as few as 10 models, which at target production would amount 2 million sales per year for each model line. By comparison, Toyota sells just more than 1 million Corollas a year globally.\n\nTesla has a lead over its rivals in manufacturing EVs at a profit. Chief Engineer Lars Moravy said the company expects to build its next-generation vehicles for half the cost of the current Model 3 or Model Y.He described a production process for future EVs an \"unboxed\" model of snapping together subassemblies to reduce complexity and time in production.\n\nTesla executive Peter Bannon gave an example of how the company uses data to cut costs. Customer data showed Tesla owners did not use the sunroof, he said, \"so we removed it.\"",

                    "body": "By Simon Alvarez Posted on March 5, 2023\n\nFor better or worse, Tesla Investor Day was a technical tour de force that involved in-depth discussions on the electric vehicle maker's plans for the future. Similar to other Tesla live events, however, Investor Day ended up polarizing Wall Street analysts and EV community members alike. So polarizing was Investor Day that even some longtime Tesla bulls on social media disagreed on whether the event was beneficial for the company or a gross miscalculation.\n\nFormer Ford CEO Mark Fields seems to be in the former camp about Tesla Investor Day. In recent comments, Fields noted that he saw the event as a way for the company to reaffirm its reign over the electric vehicle segment. While the event did not include specific details on new vehicles, the former Ford CEO stated that it still showed Tesla's leadership in critical areas.\n\nFields shared his comments during a segment with CNBC following Investor Day. Fields stated that while competitors such as Ford and Hyundai are making a lot of headway in their respective electric vehicle programs, Tesla was able to highlight that it is one generation ahead of the competition.\n\n\"And Tesla right now is one generation ahead of the other automakers. Tesla still has the leg-up on the competition, and I think they demonstrated that yesterday,\" Fields said.\n\nFields also noted that there would likely be multiple winners in the EV race, especially as the electric vehicle market continues to hit its pace. \"There's going to be a number of winners, and there's going to be a number of losers because, when you look at the adoption of EVs over time, I mean, this is a huge addressable market,\" Fields said.\n\nThe technical nature of Investor Day and its lack of focus on the innovations behind the creation and production of its next-generation car -- not the specifics of the vehicle itself -- partly resulted in Tesla stock taking a 7% dive following the event. Other criticisms about the event involved the style and length of the Investor Day presentation itself, which has been compared negatively to the refined quality of keynotes from companies like Apple.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact us with news tips. Just send a message to simon@teslarati.com to give us a heads up.\n\nTesla Investor Day was polarizing, but Former Ford CEO came away impressed",

                    "body": "Benzinga - As Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) owners continue to wait for Elon Musk to come through on his \"full self-driving\" promise, recent reports indicate fully autonomous capabilities might be further away than most think, or at least that they were in 2016.\n\nWhat To Know: According to a CNN report from January citing testimony from a senior Tesla engineer, a video Tesla used to promote its self-driving technology in 2016 was staged.\n\nThe video, which remains archived on Tesla's website, made it look like the vehicle was capable of stopping at red lights and accelerating off the line on its own, but testimony from Ashok Elluswamy, director of autopilot software at Tesla, showed the vehicle was not capable of such.\n\n\"The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,\" Elluswamy said, per Reuters.\n\nElluswamy's testimony marked the first time a Tesla employee confirmed how the video was produced. The Tesla engineer noted Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route to stage the video. Drivers reportedly had to take over control of the vehicle during the test runs. One even crashed into a fence in Tesla's parking lot, Elluswamy said.\n\nRelated Link: Elon Musk Left Bewildered By Peculiar Davos 2023 Rule Of Not Allowing EVs To Drive Around VIPs: 'Ironic Indeed'\n\nAt the beginning of the video, Tesla noted, \"The person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.\"\n\nWhen the self-driving video was released in 2016, Musk took to Twitter to confirm the vehicle was driving on its own.\n\n\"Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot,\" Musk said at the time, adding a link to the video.\n\nA trial regarding old tweets from Musk came to a close last month after a jury found that the Tesla CEO did not deceive investors in 2018 when he tweeted that he had secured the necessary funding to take Tesla private.\n\nIn mid-February, Tesla was forced to recall more than 360,000 vehicles after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that vehicles equipped with the beta version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving software presented safety challenges in and around intersections.\n\nPer the recall notice, concerns included driving through intersections while in turn-only lanes, proceeding through intersections without coming to a complete stop at stop signs and unsafely entering intersections \"without due caution\" while traffic lights were flashing yellow.",

                    "body": "Seven years ago, I put down my AU$1500 deposit and sat tight and anxious waiting for my Tesla Standard Range Plus (SR+) to arrive. Which she did, three and half years later. We watched videos, we participated in events. Tesla even brought out a left-hand drive version and we queued for one and a half hours so we could sit in it for 90 seconds. The Tesla representative had a stopwatch and we were quickly moved in and out. Now Tess is about to hit 100. Well, 100,000 km.\n\nWhy a Tesla, you ask -- well, we wanted to do our bit for the planet and we had tried all the other electric cars that were available back then in Australia. That's not many, I can assure you -- the BMW i3, the Renault Zoe, the Hyundai Ioniq, and the Jaguar i-PACE. All fell short of our expectations. Or were ridiculously priced for what you got.\n\nNow, Majella and I would give different reasons for owning a Tesla. We still care about the environment and we take climate change seriously, but Tess has given us so much more. Our lives are richer. Tess is just about to hit the 100,000 km travelled mark, and here is a reflection of our experience with it.\n\nWell, she didn't get a letter from the king, but as Tess hit 100K, she did get a visit from the Tesla technician. Every time we closed our boot, the reversing camera switched off and couldn't use Autopilot either.\n\nTesla Australia had issued a recall to replace the rear wire harness, but then said they didn't have any parts. ... We'd be notified. Well, we weren't, but it got so annoying that we arranged for a technician to call. As I write, Isaac (who used to work for Mercedes) is outside removing the old harness and fitting a new one.\n\nHe asked us how we were enjoying the car, and I replied that apart from the battery bursting into flames every week or so, it has been great. The wife still wants to upgrade to a Model Y. Let's see how my Tesla shares go ... still getting over the Twitter kerfuffle at the moment.\n\nWe have had three and a half years with a Tesla Model 3 SR+ in Australia. It has opened up a whole new life for us. We are both retired, and have plenty of grandkids to babysit and friends to visit. But, now, I have a new career writing about Tess and her friends. I get to hear and write about the most amazing stories. People are very generous with their time and information. I spent this morning with two engineers who ride \"Onewheels\" and have sat in on seminars on how to convert your car to an electric drivetrain. Many of the people I interview are CEOs of startups with grand visions of future technologies, like Janus Electric. Some have not had as much success. But the energy is there.\n\nWhy buy a Tesla? (Or any other EV for that matter.) When I am asked that question now, the foremost answer is because of the driving experience. It reminds me so much of driving my Mini Cooper S back in the '70s, except that the Tesla is much more relaxing to drive on the long trips. Thrilling acceleration. \"Go faster, grandad!\"\n\nThe economics of owning an EV is worth checking out. As they approach price parity with ICE cars at the purchase point, it will be even more obvious that an EV is a smart choice. We have saved many thousands of dollars by using electricity and not petrol. We have paid next to nothing on servicing, and even registration is half what we used to pay for our V6.\n\nHave things broken down? Yep. But everything has been fixed under warranty -- the roof glass that cracked, the 12-volt battery that died young, the radio, the shonky ball joint. And smaller issues have been fixed in my driveway by the mobile technician or as an over-the-air (OTA) update. Over the years, I have gotten sick of changing vehicles and learning the new tech in the cars. So, buying a Tesla was going to be my last vehicle purchase -- little did I know that the car changes frequently and I have to learn new gadgets and gizmos each time they do. Thankfully, Tess is always there with friendly advice (and not so friendly sound effects).\n\nI shouldn't complain about OTA updates. They have given us greater battery range, and Caraoke.\n\nWe have done a few road trips, once the COVID police released us from our suburbs. Every trip is an adventure as Australia slowly closes the gaps between high-speed chargers on the highway. If we were driving our petrol car, we would have gone faster and not had a picnic at Dingo, or made friends with the publican at Alpha who generously let us charge in his bottle shop on our way to Winton.\n\nThe Tesla has been a significant hit with the grandkids. First up, let me say I probably wouldn't be driving them around so much if I was having to pay for the petrol. Two of my grandsons had had a particularly tough day at school, as boys so often do, and were sitting looking all grumpy in the back seat. On goes fart mode! And it's smiles and laughter all round.\n\nMy granddaughters love Frozen, and we have sung \"Let It Go\" a thousand times. If we are parked waiting, either for an older one to finish school for the day or for daddy to knock off work, then Leon likes to play Beach Buggy with Ma. Seth gets us to drive slowly past his classmates and winds down the window as they chant \"Tesla.\" Now they believe that Ma and Grandad have a cool electric car.\n\nWe don't miss the fumes, noise, and dirt of the petrol stations. Nor having to get all the kids out of the car and drag them into the office to pay for petrol. Now that we have a battery-powered air pump, we don't even go to check the tyres. All of our garden equipment is battery operated also. No more fossil fuels for us.\n\nWe have found the people in the EV subculture (it is not quite a cult) very friendly and inclusive. We wave as we drive down the road and most of them wave back -- Tesla and non-Tesla alike. With solar on the roof of the house and an electric car, we feel like we are doing our part to battle climate change. Preserving the planet for our grandchildren.\n\nWhen travelling, we feel freer with our cash, supporting local businesses rather than the fossil fuel giants. The Tesla is a sexy, sporty car that we can be proud of, and the interior is easy to clean! (Back to the grandkids again!)\n\nSo, as Tess hits a hundred (thousand) and gets a new set of glasses (rear-view camera), I am reflecting on the joys and challenges of being an early adopter of EVs. Wouldn't have missed this fun adventure for the world. Thanks, Isaac, and Elon, and all who have made the Tesla dream possible.",

                    "title": "Tesla cuts vehicle prices in bid to boost flagging demand",
                    "body": "With its sales slowing and its stock price tumbling, Tesla Inc recently slashed prices dramatically, on several versions of its electric vehicles, making some of its models eligible for a new federal tax credit that could help spur buyer interest.\n\nThe company dropped prices nearly 20% in the United States on some versions of the Model Y SUV, its top seller. That cut will make more versions of the Model Y eligible for a US $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit, which will be available through March. Tesla also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive model, by about 6%.\n\nSince the start of last year, the stock has plummeted more than 65%. Many investors fear that Tesla's sales slowdown will persist and have grown concerned about the erratic behaviour of CEO Elon Musk and the distractions caused by his $44 billion purchase of Twitter.\n\n\"I think the real driver for all of this is falling demand for Teslas,\" said Guidehouse Research e-Mobility analyst Sam Abuelsamid.\n\nBased on the current short delivery times for Tesla vehicles that once were months long, Tesla's once-sizable order backlog may have been depleted, said Scott Case, CEO of Recurrent, who analyses the new and used EV markets.\n\n\"We think it's now more of a competition thing,\" he said.\n\nUnlike many of its rivals, though, Tesla can still make money on EVs for one crucial reason, Case said: The company enjoys high profit margins, thanks to manufacturing and battery efficiencies.\n\nCompetitors generally lack Tesla's economies of scale and other efficiencies and may struggle to match the price cuts. If so, Tesla could manage to keep vehicle sales at sufficient levels.\n\n\"They can afford to make this cut and not be lighting money on fire,\" Case said.\n\nTesla still faces the threat of intensifying competition from other automakers in the United States and globally for years to come. Last year in the United States, total EV sales soared nearly 65% from 2021. Automakers sold 47 electric vehicle models; only four were Teslas. S&P Global Mobility expects the number of EV models to surge to 159 by 2025.\n\nAnd as overall EV sales are rising, Tesla's US market share is falling. From 2018 through 2020, Tesla represented about 80% of the EV market. By 2021, that figure had sunk to 71%, and it has continued to decline, according to registration data gathered by S&P.\n\nStill, Tesla's US sales rose 40% last year, and S&P expects them to continue to rise as overall electric vehicle sales steadily increase.\n\nEven with U S tax credits, EVs remain pricey compared with gas-powered vehicles, largely because of the high cost of batteries. In addition, higher loan rates and more expensive raw materials are keeping costs high for buyers and could limit EV sales for Tesla as well as its competitors.\n\nEdward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said those factors are reducing demand for all vehicles, not just Teslas.\n\nMusk's provocative behaviour on Twitter may also be a factor in lower demand. Since taking over the social media platform in October, Musk has loosened restrictions on hate speech and other questionable conduct.\n\nHe has repeatedly engaged with figures on the right and far-right and has frequently attacked what he describes as the \"woke mind virus\"- a pejorative umbrella term for liberal views that Musk asserts are threatening civilization.\n\nMusk's views are sharply at odds with those of many environmentally conscious Tesla customers who lean Democratic. Survey data from Morning Consult Brand Intelligence shows that in the past year, the number of Americans who view Tesla favourably has dropped. In January of 2022, nearly 43% had a favourable opinion of Tesla, with nearly 15% negative. By this month, those with favourable opinions had dropped to 37%, while the negative views rose to 24%.\n\nCase said he has heard long-time Tesla buyers say during the past six months that they aren't sure about being seen in a Tesla anymore and that they would now consider buying an EV from a competitor.\n\nWith Tesla's recent price cuts, its Model Y Performance model, formerly priced at nearly US $70,000, now starts at just under US $57,000. The starting price of the Model 3, Tesla's lowest-priced vehicle, was cut to just under US $44,000 from US $47,000.\n\nThe company's decision to drop the base price of the Model 3, which had already been eligible for the federal tax credit, was a clear sign that demand had weakened, Abuelsamid noted.\n\nTesla has added two huge factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin that are running at only a fraction of their output capacities, \"which is undoubtedly costing them dearly,\" Abuelsamid said.",

                    "body": "By William Johnson Posted on March 4, 2023\n\nTesla published a new video showing off the company's real-world crash test safety system, which it claims is a first of its kind.\n\nTesla has long prided itself on its high safety standards, which they remain a leader in. And while electric vehicles have some inherent safety benefits, including a lower center of gravity and more room for crumple zones, Tesla also has worked to improve its testing systems as well. Now, Tesla's Japanese Twitter account has published a video giving a behind-the-scenes look at the Tesla crash safety system.\n\nThe videos of the crash testing center were published to Tesla's Japanese Twitter account early this morning, showing off its successful results and unique approach to testing.\n\nAs addressed in numerous previous Tesla announcements, Tesla's industry advantage comes from the fact that each of its vehicles currently on the road operates as its own crash-testing vehicle. Whenever a Tesla gets into an accident, the vehicle can inform analysts about where the vehicle gets hit, how hard, how many people were in the vehicle, when the airbag was deployed, and much more. This data can then be used to dramatically improve vehicles for crashes that are actually happening in the real world.\n\nOn top of this real-world testing, Tesla also showed off its testing facility, which, much like the NHTSA in the U.S. or EuroNCAP in Europe, allows the automaker to simulate crashes with real vehicles and analyze the results in more detail.\n\nTesla has not revealed what changes they have made thanks to the help of this system, but with such a rich dataset, there is no doubt the opportunity for improvement is great.\n\nOutside of Tesla's own testing, it has found similar success. The IIHS recently granted the Tesla Model Y the highest safety rating possible, while the Tesla Model 3 received the second-highest rating.\n\nAs consumers and regulators alike look to continue to improve vehicle safety standards in the coming years, valuable data on where vehicles get hit and how will prove to become increasingly more useful to automakers. And while other automakers will likely create these systems in the coming years, it is great to know that Tesla has already introduced these amazing life-saving changes.\n\nWhat do you think of the article?

However, the Tesla stock sprung back as Musk said it could sell as many as two million cars this year. A remarkable number of individual investors also drove over $14 billion in purchases of Tesla's stock that individuals made this year.\n\nGiacomo Pierantoni, head of data at Vanda said, according to the Journal, \"The aggregate retail inflows into Tesla have never been higher.\" Part of the reason is that Tesla trades 177 million shares a day. Ford, considered widely traded, moves 61 million shares per day.\n\nWhy has this happened? First, Tesla is a cult stock. It has had a following among investors for many years. Musk is one of the best-known people in the world. According to brand valuation research, Tesla is one of the best-known brands and most valuable.\n\nTesla remains the best-selling electric car in the world by far. Coverage of its self-driving features appears in the press repeatedly. The self-driving feature has not always gotten good coverage. Some say it is dangerous and has caused crashes.\n\nMusk has been one of the most visible people in the world, on par with national leaders and celebrities. His comments are often considered ill-advised but are widely quoted. Musk is viewed as a hero by some and a villain by others.\n\nMusk's purchase of Twitter has made him even more famous. He has fired thousands of people from the company. Outsiders worry he will let anyone use the platform, even if for hate speech. This portion of his fame cascades to his position at Tesla. Some investors worry this effect is not always positive. (These are the 13 biggest electric vehicle business failures in American history)\n\nThe reasons people invest in Tesla's shares will not change soon. Retail investors will continue to pile into the stock in record numbers.",

                    "title": "Opinion | Ford vs. Tesla: Guess Which One Is More Old-Fashioned",
                    "body": "Tesla had me convinced, for a while, that it was a cool company.\n\nIt made cars that performed animatronic holiday shows using their lights and power-operated doors. It came up with dog mode (a climate control system that stays running for dogs in a parked car), a GPS-linked air suspension that remembers where the speed bumps are and raises the car automatically, and \"fart mode\" (where the car makes fart sounds).\n\nAnd, fundamentally, its cars had no competition. If you wanted an electric car that could go more than 250 miles between charges, Tesla was your only choice for the better part of a decade. The company's C.E.O., Elon Musk, came across as goofy and eccentric: You could build great cars and name each model such that the lineup spells \"SEXY.\"\n\nOr you would, if not for the party-killers over at boring old Ford. Ford thwarted Mr. Musk's \"SEXY\" gambit by preventing Tesla from naming its small sedan the Model E, since that sounds a bit too much like a certain famous Ford, the Model T. So Mr. Musk went with Model 3, which either ruins the joke or elevates it, depending on how much you venerate Tesla and Elon Musk. I count myself as a former admirer of Mr. Musk and Tesla, and in fact put a deposit on a Model 3 after my first drive of one.\n\nBut the more I dealt with Tesla as a reporter -- this was before Mr. Musk fired all the P.R. people who worked there -- the more skeptical I became. Any time I spoke to anyone at Tesla, there was a sense that they were terrified to say the wrong thing, or anything at all. I wanted to know the horsepower of the Model 3 I was driving, and the result was like one of those oblique Mafia conversations where nothing's stated explicitly, in case the Feds are listening. I ended up saying, \"Well, I read that this car has 271 horsepower,\" and the Tesla person replied, \"I wouldn't disagree with that.\" This is not how healthy, functional companies answer simple factual questions.\n\nThat was back in 2017. In the years since, Tesla's become even crankier, while its competition has loosened up. Public perception hasn't yet caught up with the reality of the situation. If you want to work for a flexible, modern company, you don't apply to Tesla. You apply to 120-year-old Ford.\n\nTesla's veneer of irreverence conceals an inflexible core, an old-fashioned corporate autocracy. Consider Tesla's remote work policy, or lack thereof. Last year, Mr. Musk issued a decree that Tesla employees log 40 hours per week in an office -- and not a home office -- if they expected to keep their jobs. On Indeed.com, the question, \"Can you work remotely at Tesla?\" includes answers like, \"No,\" and \"Absolutely not, they won't let it happen under any circumstances,\" and \"No, Tesla will work you until you lose everything.\"\n\nBut on the other hand, the cars make fart noises. What a zany and carefree company!\n\nFord's work-from-home rules for white-collar employees, meanwhile, sound straight out of Silicon Valley, in that the official corporate policy is that there is no official corporate policy -- it's up to the leaders of individual units to require in-person collaboration, or not, as situations dictate. There are new \"collaboration centers\" in lieu of cubicle farms, complete with food service and concierges. That's not the reality of daily work life for every person at Ford -- you can't exactly bolt together an F-150 from home -- but it's an attempt to provide some flexibility for as many people as possible.\n\nFord also tends to make good on its promises, an area that's become increasingly fraught for Tesla. Ford said it would offer a hands-free driver assist system, and now it does, with BlueCruise; you can take your hands off the steering wheel when it is engaged on premapped sections of highway. Tesla's Full Self-Driving system is not hands-free in any situation, despite its name, and Tesla charges customers $15,000 for the feature on the promise that someday it will make the huge leap to full autonomous driving.\n\nIf you want to pay $15,000 for a feature that's currently subject to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recall whose filing is titled \"Full Self-Driving Software May Cause Crash,\" don't let me stop you, but a Tesla engineer also recently testified that a company video purporting to show the system in flawless action was faked. This makes sense, given all the other very real videos of Full Self-Driving doing things like steering into oncoming traffic or braking to a complete stop on a busy street for no reason. Tesla's own website warns, \"The currently enabled features require a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.\" So, full self-driving, except for that.\n\nTesla's long-promised new vehicles, like the Cybertruck and a new version of its Roadster, also keep getting delayed. The Cybertruck was unveiled in 2019, and on Tesla's most recent earnings call Mr. Musk admitted that it won't be in production this year, which is becoming an annual refrain. Sure, Ford sold only 15,617 electric F-150 Lightning pickups in 2022, but that beats the Cybertruck's sales by, let's see, 15,617. Besides stealing Tesla's market share on trucks, Ford's stealing its corporate impishness, too -- when the electric Mustang Mach-E was unveiled, Ford demonstrated its tailgating possibilities by filling its drainable front trunk (or \"frunk\") with shrimp. \"Frunk shrimp\" became a meme, which surely tormented the emperor of try-hard social media posting, Elon Musk.\n\nSpeaking of which: Twitter. I will hazard the opinion that Mr. Musk's $44 billion purchase of Twitter has not exactly burnished Tesla's reputation. Besides showcasing the questionable decision-making inherent in paying that much for Twitter, Mr. Musk's heightened profile on the platform hasn't really done him any favors. For instance, when the bulk of your car company's sales are in blue states, is it helpful to tweet, \"My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci\"? Moreover, you'd think that the self-appointed class clown of corporate America would at least strive for a joke that eschews the hacky \"my pronouns are/I identify as\" construction. Maybe just go with \"Fauci makes me grouchy?\" Elon, let's workshop this next time.\n\nMaybe predictability isn't trendy, but if you buy a new car you'd probably like to think that its manufacturer won't cut the price by $13,000 the next week, thus destroying your car's resale value. And you might hope that features you pay for work on the day you pay for them, and not at some unspecified future date. Maybe you want a car from a company whose C.E.O. isn't indelibly associated with the product.\n\nI just bought a Jeep and I have no idea who the C.E.O. is there. That's cool with me.\n\nEzra Dyer is a columnist for Car and Driver magazine.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
