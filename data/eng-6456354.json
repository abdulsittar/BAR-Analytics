And local physicians with elderly patients and advocates for seniors said they have been given no information on the subject from the Florida Department of Health or federal Medicare officials.",

                    "body": "Source: The Conversation - Canada - By Don Drummond, Stauffer-Dunning Fellow in Global Public Policy and Adjunct Professor at the School of Policy Studies, Queen's University, Ontario\n\nCanada's population is rapidly aging, but is it aging well? In our November 2020 report \"Ageing Well,\" we found both good and bad news.\n\nThe good is that Canadians are living longer. Back when medicare became the backbone of our health-care system about 60 years ago, seniors made up 7.6 per cent of the population. They now constitute 17.5 per cent and will be almost 25 per cent in 2041 -- 10.8 million people whose average age will be in the low 80s just over 20 years from now. They should all age happily and well.\n\nThe bad news is that they don't want to live in old-folks' homes where current policy tends to put them. Also, ensuring they have the support services they need to age well will require major changes to how, where and by whom those services are provided, and change can be difficult to implement in any dimension of health care.\n\nProviding those services will also cost each of us more, both individually and as taxpayers. Canada is heading into a less robust economic period, in part due to the need to pay down our COVID-19 debt -- and we may be hard-pressed to pay that bill.\n\nLong-term care (LTC) in all Canadian provinces has become more or less synonymous with the care and services provided in nursing and retirement homes owned and operated by private for-profit and not-for-profit companies, charities and municipalities.\n\nRelative to many other developed countries, the foundation of Canadian policy to meet the needs of the elderly is aptly described as \"warehousing,\" housing designed primarily to optimize the efficient provision of nursing and personal care. Most if not all such care homes also do their best to provide other services too, but it's fair to say that meeting seniors' social and recreational needs plays second fiddle to meeting their personal and health-care needs.\n\nWhat do our seniors want? It's not to live in an institution, the possible exception being the poor soul who has lingered too long in an alternative level of care bed: no longer in need of intensive in-hospital care but still requiring some services not readily available in most Canadian provinces other than LTC facilities.\n\nTo age well, seniors have four interrelated needs:\n\nWith respect to the money we spend to help our seniors age well, Canada is an outlier among developed countries. We spend less overall (in 2017, 1.3 per cent of Canada's GDP) on long-term continuing care and services; only Spain spends less (0.7 per cent). Implementing the likely recommendations to come out of several provincial COVID-related LTC reviews will likely take us to the OECD average, or slightly above it.\n\nHowever, our outlier status will remain accentuated by our remarkably imbalanced spending of $1 on home care for every $6 spent on institutional LTC. Most others spend roughly equal amounts, and those most highly regarded for the high quality and happy outcomes of enabling seniors to age well -- Denmark and the Netherlands, for example -- do the reverse. They spend more on home and community services than on institutional care.\n\nGiven our foreseeable demographic and economic circumstances, continuing with the same policy choices defies comprehension.\n\nFirst, as COVID-19 has clearly demonstrated, care homes are dangerous places in which infectious diseases can spread easily; some 80 per cent of deaths in the first wave in Canada were in LTC homes.\n\nSecond, given the increased number and advancing age of the baby boomer generation, continuing with our warehousing propensity is doomed to failure. The number of care-home beds that would be required is simply beyond what we could afford. This is compounded by the fact that such beds were already subject to long waiting lists even before their post-COVID-19 downsizing to eliminate shared rooms and washrooms.\n\nThird, to reiterate, few seniors want to live in long-term care, preferring strongly to remain in their own homes and communities or in various alternative forms of communal housing in which they have access to home and community services.\n\nAnd fourth, the cost of institutional accommodation and care -- to residents, their families and the public purse -- exceeds by far what it would cost to provide an extended range of seniors' needs through beefed-up home and community support services. That would be expensive too, but it's an approach to helping our seniors age well that our country could afford.\n\nSubstantial change to Canada's long-term support service systems is long overdue. It's time to get at it.",

The Harrison House closed to visitors ahead of the state's recommendation in March and built a pressurized entrance to its isolation unit for seniors coming from the hospital in April. Despite all of these precautions, COVID-19 cases still occurred, as they did in long-term care facilities across the country. Dr. Levy says most of those cases came from the outside, not from seniors already living inside and she says the vaccine will not only better protect those seniors, it will get them closer to seeing their families in person again.",

                    "body": "The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nCanada's population is rapidly aging, but is it aging well? In our November 2020 report \"Ageing Well,\" we found both good and bad news.\n\nThe good is that Canadians are living longer. Back when medicare became the backbone of our health-care system about 60 years ago, seniors made up 7.6 per cent of the population. They now constitute 17.5 per cent and will be almost 25 per cent in 2041 -- 10.8 million people whose average age will be in the low 80s just over 20 years from now. They should all age happily and well.\n\nThe bad news is that they don't want to live in old-folks' homes where current policy tends to put them. Also, ensuring they have the support services they need to age well will require major changes to how, where and by whom those services are provided, and change can be difficult to implement in any dimension of health care.\n\nProviding those services will also cost each of us more, both individually and as taxpayers. Canada is heading into a less robust economic period, in part due to the need to pay down our COVID-19 debt -- and we may be hard-pressed to pay that bill.\n\nLong-term care (LTC) in all Canadian provinces has become more or less synonymous with the care and services provided in nursing and retirement homes owned and operated by private for-profit and not-for-profit companies, charities and municipalities.\n\nRelative to many other developed countries, the foundation of Canadian policy to meet the needs of the elderly is aptly described as \"warehousing,\" housing designed primarily to optimize the efficient provision of nursing and personal care. Most if not all such care homes also do their best to provide other services too, but it's fair to say that meeting seniors' social and recreational needs plays second fiddle to meeting their personal and health-care needs.\n\nWhat seniors need to age well\n\nWhat do our seniors want? It's not to live in an institution, the possible exception being the poor soul who has lingered too long in an alternative level of care bed: no longer in need of intensive in-hospital care but still requiring some services not readily available in most Canadian provinces other than LTC facilities.\n\nTo age well, seniors have four interrelated needs:\n\nHousing appropriate to their needs and preferences. For most, their strong preference is for the family home in the same community with familiar neighbours, surroundings and amenities. They want to age in place and remain there as long as they possibly can, receiving the care and support services they need at home.\n\nFlexible health and personal care, and household support appropriate for each individual or elderly couple as their needs wax and wane. These needs usually increase as they age, but not always. Evidence shows clearly that if the well-being of seniors is supported in all its dimensions, and if the delivery of services begins \"upstream\" at the first sign of trouble, the prevention and slowing -- if not reversing -- of the onset and progression of both dementia and other manifestations of frailty can be achieved.\n\nSocialization is another of the four key needs of aging well, a need met best by enabling seniors to remain in their own communities with their families, friends and neighbours and recognizing their familiarity with the range of the services their community provides.\n\nMeeting seniors' lifestyle and/or recreational needs is also vital to aging well, especially as they're integrated with the individual's or couple's social needs. Sadly, data indicate that seniors, like too many other Canadians in our contemporary online society, are succumbing to \"couch potato\" tendencies that erode the beneficial effects both of social interactions and regular exercise.\n\nWith respect to the money we spend to help our seniors age well, Canada is an outlier among developed countries. We spend less overall (in 2017, 1.3 per cent of Canada's GDP) on long-term continuing care and services; only Spain spends less (0.7 per cent). Implementing the likely recommendations to come out of several provincial COVID-related LTC reviews will likely take us to the OECD average, or slightly above it.\n\nHowever, our outlier status will remain accentuated by our remarkably imbalanced spending of $1 on home care for every $6 spent on institutional LTC. Most others spend roughly equal amounts, and those most highly regarded for the high quality and happy outcomes of enabling seniors to age well -- Denmark and the Netherlands, for example -- do the reverse. They spend more on home and community services than on institutional care.\n\nFour factors that must change\n\nGiven our foreseeable demographic and economic circumstances, continuing with the same policy choices defies comprehension.\n\nFirst, as COVID-19 has clearly demonstrated, care homes are dangerous places in which infectious diseases can spread easily; some 80 per cent of deaths in the first wave in Canada were in LTC homes.\n\nSecond, given the increased number and advancing age of the baby boomer generation, continuing with our warehousing propensity is doomed to failure. The number of care-home beds that would be required is simply beyond what we could afford. This is compounded by the fact that such beds were already subject to long waiting lists even before their post-COVID-19 downsizing to eliminate shared rooms and washrooms.\n\nThird, to reiterate, few seniors want to live in long-term care, preferring strongly to remain in their own homes and communities or in various alternative forms of communal housing in which they have access to home and community services.\n\nAnd fourth, the cost of institutional accommodation and care -- to residents, their families and the public purse -- exceeds by far what it would cost to provide an extended range of seniors' needs through beefed-up home and community support services. That would be expensive too, but it's an approach to helping our seniors age well that our country could afford.\n\nSubstantial change to Canada's long-term support service systems is long overdue. It's time to get at it.",

Mayor Dan Gelber said the city's limited supply will serve to vaccinate 300 seniors total.\n\nThe city has not yet released a timeline for when the rest of the doses will be administered or how interested seniors can schedule appointments.\n\nThe fire department received the vaccine doses Tuesday from the Florida Department of Health and will use an industrial freezer to store the 60 vials of the vaccine.\n\nSince Dec. 29, the city has transported more than 127 seniors to Mount Sinai Medical Center to get vaccinated.\n\nGelber said the city is \"incredibly anxious\" to begin homebound vaccinations for seniors.\n\n\"It's an important group because a lot of them might have more difficulty getting to the hospital,\" he said.",

                    "title": "Schulte announces New Years' tax reduction to help out seniors",
                    "body": "Canada's Minister for Seniors Deb Schulte issued an opinion editorial on Jan. 4 through her press secretary Daniel Pollak. In this op-ed, she mentions a New Year's tax reduction for seniors to strengthen their financial security in general and lists all the actions her government has taken to help Canadian seniors improve their financial well-being. However, Bill VanGorder, chief policy officer with CARP and MP Rosemarie Falk, the Conservative shadow minister for seniors are not impressed with the news and think more needs to be done to ensure seniors' financial stability, not only in general but also in light of the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSchulte announced another federal government tax reduction for seniors to ring in the New Year in her Jan. 4 op-ed, which she says will help out the middle class and help Canadian seniors' financial security. Her government plans to increase the basic personal amount by 2023, and 4.3 million seniors will benefit from it, including 465,000 seniors whose federal income tax will be reduced to zero. This will save singles almost $300 yearly and couples will save nearly $600, savings that will help them with everyday expenses like groceries, hydro and deliveries.\n\n\"It's part of the Liberal government delivering on their plan to make life more affordable for seniors,\" she says.\n\nSchulte described what her government had done in years past to help out seniors, including a 2016 middle class tax cut to reduce personal income taxes, resulting in $330 in savings for singles and $540 in savings for couples, and reversing the previous Conservative government's increase to the age of eligibility for OAS and GIS from 67 years of age back to age 65, putting thousands of dollars back into new seniors' pockets. According to Schulte, her government increased the GIS by $947 to help low-income seniors and increased the GIS earnings exemption so they can earn up to $5,000 without any benefits reduction and get a partial exemption on their next $10,000 in income. They helped out seniors with extra COVID-19 related expenses by making one-time payments thought the GST Credit in April and the OAS in July, worth over $1,500 for a low-income couple, tax free. They also worked with the provinces and territories to increase the CPP's maximum yearly benefit for future retirees by approximately 50 per cent, reducing the risk of not saving enough for retirement. Overall, Schulte says that these policies have shown good results in that 25 per cent fewer seniors are living in poverty than when her government took office in 2015.\n\n\"As seniors age, they are more likely to outlive their savings, have disabilities, be unable to work and be widowed, all while their health care costs are rising. To help address these pressures on older seniors' quality of life, the Liberal government has reaffirmed our commitment to increasing OAS by 10 per cent once a senior reaches 75 years of age,\" she says.\n\nSchulte concludes the op-ed by saying that taken together, her government's ambitious and progressive measures are making a real difference in seniors' financial security but there is more to do.\n\n\"Canadian seniors can always count on the Liberals to listen, understand their needs and work hard to deliver them.\"\n\nFalk is not impressed with Schulte's announcement in the op-ed, saying that COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on Canada's seniors.\n\n\"Yet the Trudeau government's throne speech and fall economic statement failed to deliver any sort of clear plan to help seniors who are struggling. Minister Schulte's announcement is a reannouncement of a 2019 campaign promise. While the Conservatives support improving the financial security of Canada's seniors, the Liberals, who give with one hand and take with the other, can't be trusted. After Parliament recessed, they announced they would triple the carbon tax meaning seniors will pay more for necessities like groceries and home heating. Unfortunately, the Liberals record of high taxes and reckless spending jeopardizes social programs and ultimately increases the cost of living for those who can afford it the least, including our seniors. Eliminating the carbon tax and not raising taxes during the pandemic is an obvious place to start,\" she says.\n\nVanGorder concurs with Falk, agreeing that seniors are strapped for cash today as they are on fixed incomes at a time when because of the ongoing pandemic, their cost of living continues to rise.\n\n\"They cannot wait until 2023 when the basic personal amount will be fully in place. Singles getting $300 and couples getting $600 is too little too late, and seniors require more support now. Seniors have seen the government provide support in the amount of $2,000 and more to other demographics during the pandemic. They have received $300 or $500 for some with very low income,\" he says. \"They view this as being inequitable and tell CARP they are feeling at best undervalued and at worst ignored.\"",

Many in assisted-living centers have essentially been in a comfortable prison for nine months (isolating in their apartments, having food delivered, not allowed visitors, having no social activities). Many seniors experience rapid mental decline in the absence of social interaction. This is something I have witnessed in my own mother, and there are many scientific studies that have shown this to be common. Once our seniors and their caregivers are vaccinated, the state should allow families into the apartments of seniors who opt in for visitors. Those who choose to continue to self-isolate could do so. Once vaccinated, it is illogical and cruel to continue to prevent these people from seeing their families with the belief that you are protecting them.",

                    "title": "Seniors' Emotional and Social Health During the Pandemic: Most are Faring Well though Some Face Greater Challenges",
                    "body": "Early in the pandemic, it became clear that seniors are among the groups most at-risk for experiencing adverse health outcomes due to COVID-19. Although the physical effects of the virus on this population have appropriately garnered substantial attention, it is similarly important to understand how the pandemic is affecting other aspects of seniors' well-being, such as their emotional and social health. The Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative, longitudinal study of older Americans, recently released data collected between June and October of 2020 that provides insight on this subject.\n\nOverall, the majority of survey respondents over age 65 expressed a high level of concern regarding the pandemic. On a scale of one to ten, more than two-thirds said their level of concern was eight or higher. Despite concern over the pandemic, however, most seniors seem to be managing well emotionally. Only 6 percent said they have often felt emotionally overwhelmed since the pandemic began and only 9 percent said they have often felt stressed, although 35 percent said they have sometimes felt emotionally overwhelmed and 46 percent said they have sometimes felt stressed since the pandemic began (Figure 1). Given their greater susceptibility to the illness, however, we might expect older seniors to experience greater distress than younger seniors. However, younger seniors (65-75 years of age) and older seniors (over age 75) reported being stressed or emotionally overwhelmed at about the same frequency.\n\nFurthermore, only 4 percent of seniors said they have often felt lonely since the pandemic began, although 38 percent said they have sometimes felt lonely. Most seniors, 67 percent, said their frequency of feeling lonely has not changed with the pandemic, and in fact, 5 percent said they have felt lonely less often since the start of the pandemic. However, more than a quarter of seniors, 28 percent, said they have felt lonely more often since the pandemic began. Frequency of loneliness did not vary much between younger seniors and older seniors.\n\nFigure 1. Percent of adults age 65 and older who have felt stressed, overwhelmed, or lonely since the start of the pandemic\n\nOther survey questions asked how often a person has experienced feelings such as stress, depression, or loneliness in the past week. Surveys from previous years ask these questions too, allowing us to compare responses from 2020 with previous years. Comparing 2020 responses with the 2016 survey results shows that the percent of seniors experiencing stress, depression, or loneliness in the past week is nearly the same in both years (Figure 2).\n\nFig. 2 Percent of adults age 65 and older who felt lonely, sad, or depressed in the past week: 2016 and 2020\n\nWhile these data suggest most seniors are weathering the pandemic well emotionally, some are struggling more than usual during this time. It is also possible that more seniors will experience emotional challenges as the pandemic wears on.\n\nRelationships with family members and friends are important to emotional well-being, but the pandemic has created barriers to gathering with our friends, family, and other members of our communities. In 2020, roughly three-quarters of seniors surveyed said since the pandemic began they had left their homes less frequently and decreased the frequency of travel to visit family or attend church.\n\nTechnology has helped fill the social void for many Americans, but what about seniors who may not be as familiar with these tools? Survey responses show that some seniors are using social media and video conferencing platforms to connect, although a large number are not. However, many are using good old-fashioned phone calls to keep in touch with others, as well as using email and snail mail.\n\nTwenty percent of seniors said they use apps such as FaceTime or Skype to connect with family and friends daily or several times a week, and another 22 percent say they use these types of apps to connect with family and friends at least once a month. Nearly 40 percent say they never use these technologies, although the majority of seniors own devices that would allow them to do so; 82 percent say they own a smartphone and 61 percent own an iPad, while 67 percent own a desktop computer, and 62 percent own a laptop computer. Seniors over age 75 are less likely to own these devices than younger seniors though and are also somewhat less likely to use video call apps like FaceTime or Skype to connect with loved ones (over half of older seniors say they never use these technologies to connect with family or friends).\n\nComparing 2020 data to 2016 data shows that seniors' engagement with social media and video conferencing apps has increased substantially over time. Far more seniors are using platforms such as Facebook or Skype to connect with family and friends in 2020 than were doing so four years ago (Figure 3). More seniors are also emailing or writing to their family and friends weekly in 2020 compared to 2016 (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 3. Percent of adults age 65 and older communicating by social media (Facebook, Skype, etc.) at least once per week: 2016 and 2020\n\nFigure 4. Percent of adults age 65 and older emailing or writing at least once a week to children, family members, and friends\n\nWhether the increase in seniors' use of social media, video conferencing, and email is a direct result of the pandemic is unclear, but roughly one quarter of seniors, 27 percent, say they have learned to use a new technology device, application, or computer program since the start of the pandemic. Thirty percent of seniors also strongly agree or somewhat agree that since the pandemic began they have found new ways to connect socially (another 30 percent agree slightly that they have found new ways to connect socially since the pandemic began).\n\nBeyond video calls and social media, seniors continue to keep in touch with family members and friends over the phone. In 2020 the majority of seniors, 72 percent, said they talk to their children over the phone every week, which was about the same percentage of seniors who said so in 2016. Furthermore, in both 2016 and 2020, nearly half of seniors said they spoke with other family members over the phone at least once a week and about half also said they spoke over the phone with friends weekly. These numbers were roughly the same for older and younger seniors in 2020.\n\nOverall, in 2020 roughly the same number of seniors -- slightly more, in fact -- said they often had someone they could talk to compared to 2016. In 2020, 68 percent said they often had someone to talk to, while 62 percent said the same in 2016. The numbers were nearly the same for older seniors as for younger seniors.\n\nInterestingly, despite seniors spending less time outside their homes or traveling to see family, most seniors still said they were meeting up with family members and friends as frequently in 2020 as they were in 2016. Perhaps some 2020 respondents counted virtual meetups in their responses, or perhaps people had resumed meeting up with family members when this data was collected, as restrictions in many places in the United States were eased during the summer months. Respondents' answers may be different now as COVID-19 cases have been increasing and more states have reinstated restrictions.\n\nBesides keeping in touch with family members and friends, nearly a quarter of seniors, 24 percent, said they had received help with tasks such as grocery shopping, running errands, or doing chores from someone outside of their home due to the pandemic. Older seniors were more likely to say they had received help with these tasks (33 percent) as compared to younger seniors (19 percent). (As noted in a previous Social Capital Project piece, several organizations established during the pandemic help seniors with tasks such as grocery shopping.)\n\nAbout a quarter of seniors, 22 percent, also said they had helped someone outside their household with grocery shopping, running errands, or chores. Younger seniors were much more likely to have helped someone outside of their household (30 percent) than older seniors (9 percent). And while a small percentage of seniors (3 percent) had received financial help from family members or friends as a result of the pandemic, a much larger share (18 percent) had provided help to someone outside their household.\n\nOverall, seniors appear to be faring well emotionally and finding ways to maintain social connections during the pandemic, at least about as well as they did prior to the pandemic. Some seniors are receiving help with tasks they are not able to perform or do not feel comfortable doing right now, and some are also lending a hand to help others with such tasks or providing financial help to friends and family in need. Encouragingly, nearly 60 percent of seniors said they agree, at least to some extent, that they feel closer to members of their community since the pandemic started.\n\nStill, this does not negate the experiences of those seniors who have faced greater emotional struggles and loneliness the last several months. While many communities and organizations have made efforts to help seniors during the pandemic, continuing this work will be important to help seniors stay connected and cared for, particularly those seniors with fewer social ties.\n\nIn order to make sure this happens, policymakers should cut red tape to ensure that non-profit organizations have the ability to fulfill their missions. Family members, friends, and neighbors must continue to reach out to seniors to help them find new ways to connect virtually or otherwise, as well as to help meet other needs. Building these and other connections today can help seniors make it through this difficult time, while also developing valuable community ties that last well past the pandemic.",

                    "title": "Opinion | Shining a light on the future of seniors' care",
                    "body": "In the 1950s and '60s when medicare was developed, life expectancy was a bit over 70 years, and seniors were only 7.5 per cent of the population. Today, life expectancy is 82 years, and seniors constitute 17 per cent of Canadians. Numbers will peak at 25 per cent in 2041 with 10.8 million seniors, by which time the majority will be 80 and older, entering a period in their lives when they will need better and more varied support services to age well, and not just in health care.\n\nIn November 2020, we published our report Aging Well with Queen's University School of Policy Studies calling to revolutionize Canada's approach to seniors' care. In our report, we propose a proactive, co-ordinated, and holistic model that considers the health-care needs of Canada's rapidly aging population in tandem with seniors' housing, lifestyle, and social needs.\n\nWe have seen the tsunami of a rapidly aging population for some time. But we have so far failed to address the challenges that come with it, or even ask if there is a better way.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has jolted our federal and provincial/territorial governments out of what appears to have been a version of sleepwalking up the beach as the tsunami built out to sea. The predominant policy of meeting the needs of seniors continues to be to \"warehouse\" them in long-term care (LTC) homes.\n\nInfectious diseases in what amount to grounded cruise ships can spread quickly: 80 per cent of deaths in the first wave of COVID were residents of care-homes. While several provincial governments have established inquiries into how to make LTC-homes safer for residents and workers, shining a light on only LTC-homes will still leave Canadians in the dark about how to ensure our elderly age healthily and happily.\n\nWhy? Because the current approach reflects a fragmented policy framework that silos seniors' health care, housing, lifestyle, and social needs rather than viewing them together, which leads to a system that addresses seniors' problems after they have arisen rather than promoting health to reduce their incidence and severity.\n\nIf the current propensity to place seniors in LTC-homes continues, the number of beds needed will double between now and 2041. Current provincial plans would only supply a fraction of those beds, which will further drive up the costs of LTC-homes (each bed in a LTC home costs the system about $142 per day, compared to $45 per day with home care).\n\nNot only are LTC-homes expensive for the health-care system, many seniors do not want to live there; they want to \"age in place\" by continuing to exercise their independence by living in the community they love. Policies that support services that are brought to them as they age-in-place for as long as they can would not only enable them to age better and more happily, it would also be much more cost-effective for the users and taxpayers alike.\n\nCanada is an international outlier when it comes to investing in home care with one of the lowest allocations in the OECD -- a measly 0.2 per cent of GDP. Many countries spend equally on institutions and home care, and some that are renowned for the life satisfaction of seniors spend more on home care than institutional care.\n\nOther countries, such as the United Kingdom and Japan, have proven the effectiveness of age-in-place services. This includes community-driven programs to offer senior-friendly physical and mental activities that keep seniors healthy and engaged.\n\nOne example comes out of the United Kingdom, where villages in which seniors can downsize to a housing option that meets their evolving needs while continuing to live in the community have grown in popularity. We have success stories here at home too: in Kingston, Ont., the Oasis communal living home serves about 60 seniors with communal meals, exercise programs, skills training, and entertainment.\n\nCanada must learn from other jurisdictions by investing in home care and community services as one side of the spectrum for seniors to age well, with LTC and acute care facilities on the other end. Implementing only one option for seniors' care is outdated and should be gone the way of the rotary telephone.\n\nCompassion, political considerations, economics, common sense, and lessons from other countries all point to the necessity of changing the current siloed policy approach that results in seniors feeling isolated, frail, and \"warehoused\" in LTC homes, to one that meets seniors' preference to \"age in place\" with a co-ordinated seniors' care policy framework.\n\nThat it has taken a global pandemic to make Canada reconsider how we care for our elderly is shameful, but we know now we can never go back to the way things were before.\n\nChange must happen now. Our seniors don't have time to wait.",

                    "body": "Can seniors look forward to increased banking protections or services under the Code of Conduct for the Delivery of Banking Services to Seniors, (https://cba.ca/Assets/CBA/Documents/Files/Article%20Category/PDF/vol-seniors-en.pdf), which came into effect on Jan. 1?\n\nRBC, one of the banks that has adopted the voluntary code, says yes and is making an effort to upgrade its services for seniors, but advocates for seniors and consumers are more skeptical.\n\n\"Codes of conduct are a common practice that provide guidelines to financial institutions and address issues in a timely and flexible manner,\" said Financial Consumer Agency of Canada spokesperson Lynne Santerre via email. \"The Code of Conduct for the Delivery of Banking Services to Seniors is an important first step in guiding banks in their delivery of services to meet the needs of seniors.\n\n\"The code applies to banks and federally regulated credit unions who are members of the Canadian Bankers Association. Almost all federally regulated financial institutions in Canada are members of the Canadian Bankers Association. However, it is important to note that any financial institution can sign on to the code and abide by its principles.\"\n\nThe major principles of the code include communicating effectively with seniors, providing appropriate training to employees who work with seniors, mitigating financial harm, such as fraud, to seniors, and taking into account market demographics and the needs of seniors before closing a branch. The banks will be asked to publish an annual report on their adherence to the code and other efforts being made to meet seniors' needs. In addition, each bank will designate a \"seniors' champion,\" a member of the management team who will support seniors' interests.\n\nRBC has been proactive in preparing to comply with the code by creating an online resource centre for seniors (https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/seniors-resource-centre.html), which is filled with video tutorials about online banking, telephone banking, fraud protection and protecting money online.\n\n\"We are continuing to adapt so we can meet or exceed the requirements of the code,\" said Rick Lowes, RBC's vice-president for retirement strategy.\n\n\"More than five million Canadians are 55 or over and seniors have unique needs. In retirement, they may be on a fixed income and using their nest eggs. We try to be aware and sensitive to that and help them through the process.\"\n\nNonetheless, seniors' advocates and advocacy groups aren't necessarily happy with the code or with the way the banking system addresses seniors' issues, despite the fact that in creating the code, the agency conducted public opinion research, engaged seniors' organizations, banks and other stakeholders in identifying seniors' banking needs and challenges, and researched practices in other jurisdictions.\n\n\"We'd like to see the government take a stronger hand in originating and enforcing regulations,\" said Bill VanGorder, vice-chair of the board for CARP, an organization representing 330,000 seniors nationwide. \"Toothless self-regulation looks lovely on paper, but it doesn't get to the heart of the complaints and concerns we hear.\"\n\nHe also wishes the government would do more to regulate people, including those who work at banks, who offer financial advice, ensuring that their titles and credentials have real training and education backing them up.\n\n\"It's a dog's breakfast of advisers out there and people often aren't sure who they're dealing with.\"\n\nPeter Whitehouse, 87, of Mississauga, is a retiree who became a passionate advocate for seniors' rights in the world of banking and investing when he lost money converting his RRSP to a RRIF, based on incorrect advice. He believes the code should be broader.\n\n\"It (the code) is geared to helping seniors get protection against external intrusions like fraud that can steal their financial well-being, while paying little attention to bank practices that can legitimately have the same negative impact,\" Whitehouse said.\n\nRetired professional engineer Ken Kivenko has created a company, Kenmar Associates, that works with Canadians who have disagreements with banks and investment advisers on financial issues. He was among those invited to provide input to the FCAC about what should be included in the code. Kivenko was pleased to see the FCAC's requirement for annual reporting about code-related initiatives, but he had hoped for a more robust set of rules.\n\n\"There is nothing about handling of complaints in the code, and that's really important,\" Kivenko said. He noted that the FCAC's own 2019 report, Bank Complaint Handling Procedures (https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/programs/research/banks-complaints-handling-procedures.html#toc0), stated, \"banks' procedures are much less effective, accessible and timely when consumers escalate more complex complaints to higher levels.\"\n\n\"Additionally,\" Kivenko said, \"I had hoped the FCAC would include the provision for seniors to name a trusted person who could be called if the bank notes something suspicious about a senior's account: unusually large withdrawals, for example, or a new joint account holder. If they see something wrong, why not put a temporary hold on the transfer of funds?\" He said this is a practice in other countries, such as the United Kingdom.\n\nFCAC's Santerre noted, \"In terms of content, important considerations in the development of the code and its various components were that business models differ substantially among financial institutions and all financial institutions must be able to implement its various elements.\"\n\nSeniors' advocates hope that the code is, as Santerre pointed out, simply the first of many steps toward improving financial options and protections for seniors.",
