I will announce the ministers and the PSs responsible so that Kenyans can know,\" Gachagua said.\n\nThe DP also alleged that the plan to move to the Supreme Court to challenge the declaration of William Ruto as the President-elect was a plot to get more time to empty the coffers.\n\nAccording to Gachagua, more than Sh24 billion was looted between the time IEBC announced Ruto as President and the day he was sworn in.\n\n\"Hiyo kesi walijua hakuna mahali inaenda, ilikuwa kesi imewekwa ndio wapore mali waende,\" he said.\n\n\"Saa ile waliona uchaguzi imeharibika walibeba na magunia. To allow them room wakati ya Supreme Court inaskiza kesi waibe pesa ya Kenya.\"",

The government is carrying out investigations which I support and people are being summoned to explain their wealth and riches, which is good,\" Atwoli affirmed.\n\nHe says by Gachagua naming the said culprits, he will end the ongoing speculations which bend on Azimio's team.\n\n\"People will keep on suspecting that anyone who was in Azimio at that time was part and parcel of those who went away with taxpayers' money.\n\n\"Those who were taking government money or going to Uhuru or Raila or anybody else by our names claiming that they want to fund us yet the money did not get to us must be known by Kenyans,\" he added.\n\nThe Deputy President threatened to expose senior government officials who served in the previous administration of retired President Uhuru Kenyatta for alleged theft of public resources.\n\nSpeaking during a Sunday service at Jesus Winner Ministry in Roysambu, Nairobi, the country's second in command claimed that more than Ksh24 billion of public money was looted in the last three months of Uhuru's administration.\n\nHe said former Cabinet Secretaries and Principal Secretaries were responsible for the looting and threatened to name them in the coming days.\n\n\"In the next few days, I will be releasing details of billions of shillings looted from the public coffers in the last three months of Uhuru's administration.

I am very excited to see you again, I thank you; I am happy for you. Kianyaga is now on the Kenyan map, and we owe gratitude to that institution,\" he told them.\n\nMr Gachagua attended Kianyaga High School for his 'O' levels, and 'A' levels between 1978 and 1983.\n\nTh DP later proceeded to the University of Nairobi (UoN) for his Higher Education, where he pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science.\n\nHe graduated in 1988.\n\nAlso read: Sonko touched by bright needy schoolgirl's plea for financial help",

Mr Rigathi arraign the suspects in Court for stealing public funds! Any cabinet secretary you have evidence of having put his/her hand in the cookie jar should pay dearly! But be very careful your time will also come,\" he said.\n\nLedama was reacting to remarks by Gachagua on Sunday, saying that he will soon reveal details and names of the former CSs and Principal secretaries who were involved in massive looting.\n\nGachagua who spoke during a church service in Nairobi said in the coming days he will release a detailed report on CSs and PSs who were involved in the looting of funds.\n\n\"In the next few days, I will be releasing details of billions of shillings looted from the public coffers in the last three months of the last administration. I will announce the ministers and the PSs responsible so that Kenyans can know,\" Gachagua said.\n\nThe DP also alleged that the plan to move to the Supreme Court to challenge the declaration of William Ruto as the President-elect was a plot to get more time to empty the coffers.\n\nAccording to Gachagua, more than Sh24 billion was looted between the time IEBC announced Ruto as President and the day he was sworn in.",

This regime can't meet any promise, so they try to focus on a witch-hunt! This unprecedented effort won't end well,\" Otiende said.\n\nThe lawmaker's reaction follows remarks by Gachagua on Sunday where he said that he will soon reveal how leaders in the Uhuru Kenyatta regime looted Sh 24 billion from the treasury after they realized Ruto had won the election.",

Between the day IEBC announced Mr. Ruto as President and the time he was sworn in they looted more than Sh24 billion,\" Gachagua alleged.\n\nThe petition, the DP added, was a cover to allow the powerful government officials-whose details he promised to reveal to empty public coffers without raising suspicion.\n\n\"Even the Mzee (presidential candidate Odinga) did not want to file the petition but he was pushed to do so to give them room to steal public money between the time of the hearing of the petition and the swearing-in,\" he said.\n\nThe second in command explained that the looted money was transported via Wilson Airport -- police airwing -- to private homes.\n\n\"They were aware that the case was lost and so they wanted to loot and go their way. In the next few days I will tell Kenyans who stole the money,\" he said recalling that he was castigated for saying this truth on the day of the inauguration.",

If indeed this is true, Azimio we strongly believe in the rule of law and we would want to see that list. We want to see who are these people.\n\n\"We would want to know what actions is the law going to take against them. But if it's hot air then again we shall say it's just witchhunt.\"\n\nOkango termed DP Gachagua's allegations as very serious and they must be put to test by investigating authorities.\n\nThis comes after Gachagua said that more than Sh24 billion was looted between the time IEBC announced Ruto as President and the day he was sworn in.\n\nGachagua vowed to release details of how money was swindled from public coffers by individuals in the former regime.\n\nSpeaking during a church service in Nairobi, he said that in the coming days, he will be releasing a report on the CSs and PSs who were involved in the looting.\n\n\"In the next few days, I will be releasing details of billions of shillings looted from the public coffers in the last three months of the last administration. I will announce the ministers and the PSs responsible so that Kenyans can know,\" Gachagua said.\n\nThe DP also alleged that the plan to move to the Supreme Court to challenge the declaration of William Ruto as the President-elect was a plot to get more time to empty public coffers.",

This regime can't meet any promise, so they try to focus on witch-hunt! This unprecedented effort won't end well,\" Otiende said.\n\nHis reaction follows remarks by Gachagua on Sunday where he said that he will soon reveal how leaders in the Uhuru Kenyatta regime looted public coffers.\n\nGachagua who spoke during a church service in Nairobi said in the coming days he will release a detailed report on CSs and PSs who were involved in the looting of funds.\n\n\"In the next few days, I will be releasing details of billions of shillings looted from the public coffers in the last three months of the last administration. I will announce the ministers and the PSs responsible so that Kenyans can know,\" Gachagua said.\n\nThe DP also alleged that the plan to move to the Supreme Court to challenge the declaration of William Ruto as the President-elect was a plot to get more time to empty the coffers.\n\nAccording to Gachagua, more than Sh24 billion was looted between the time IEBC announced Ruto as President and the day he was sworn in.",

                    "body": "Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua yesterday sustained the debate of alleged brazen embezzlement of taxpayers' money by senior government officials in the previous regime of retired president Uhuru Kenyatta days the last general elections.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during a Church Service and Jesus Winners Church in Roysambu, without naming names, Gachagua sensationally claimed that billions of shillings from the public coffers were transferred to accounts locally and abroad as the country focused on August 2022 polls.\n\nHe claimed senior government officials who included Cabinet Secretaries went on a looting spree soon after President William Ruto was declared the winner by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and the day he was sworn in on September 13, the DP said.\n\nIn what plays out like a theatre, the DP says the powerful officials initiated the massive theft of up to Sh24 billion when it became apparent that President Ruto had won against their candidate Azimio's Raila Odinga and there would be no turning back.\n\n\"On realising that the election was lost, they stole all the money and transported it in gunny bags. Between the day IEBC announced Mr Ruto as President and the time he was sworn in they looted more than Sh24 billion.\" Gachagua asserted.\n\nThe petition, the DP added, was a cover to allow the powerful government officials-whose details he promised to give-to empty public coffers without raising suspicion.\n\n\"Even the Mzee (presidential candidate Odinga) did not want to file the petition but he was pushed to do so to give them room to steal public money between the time of the hearing of the petition and the swearing in,\" he said.\n\nGachagua added that the looted money was transported via Wilson Airport -- Police Airwing -- to private homes.\n\n\"They were aware that the case was lost and so they wanted to loot and go their way. In the next few days I will tell Kenyans who stole the money.\" Said the DP.\n\nMeanwhile, the DP said the government was focused on bringing down the cost of living and would stop at nothing to ensure that there was no monopoly in the production of gas and cylinders.\n\nCompetition in production, the DP said, would kill monopolies including in the milk sector and the government's intention is to ensure that the prices come down through healthy competition.\n\nHe took issue with reports in the media indicating that ongoing efforts to lower the cost of living was informed by their political differences with certain individuals saying the Kenya Kwanza's focus is to raise the standards of the people.\n\n\"We need more competition so gas prices can come down. That's what will happen, you can make a lot of noise but it will come down. It's the same thing with milk. We are opening that sector for more competition,\" the DP stated.\n\nAlready Kenyans are enjoying lower unga prices which have dropped from Sh230 per 2kilograms when they took over last September to Sh180, he affirmed.\n\nThe DP also dismissed critics questioning their church attendance every Sunday saying they were not about to relent, promising to always join worshippers to thank God for their electoral victory.\n\n\"We shall be in church every Sunday to express our gratitude to God because it's Him who has put us where we are. We shall never lack words to say how grateful we are,\" he said.\n\nThe DP also thanked Jesus Winner Ministry Church Bishop Edward Mwai for praying for the President and him ahead of the last elections.\n\n\"It's very emotional to be back here. The last time we came here with the President, we were in much trouble but we knelt before God and the Bishop prayed for us and God delivered us victory.\" Gachagua said.\n\nOn political leadership, Gachagua said the President and himself would continue mentoring the younger leaders in Kenya Kwanza citing examples of the new United Democratic Alliance Secretary General Cleophas Malala, Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja, Zaheer Jhanda (Nyaribari Chache MP) and others \"because it's the best thing to do.\"\n\nHe praised Sakaja for running the city well adding that they would not hesitate to guide him and others where necessary.\n\nLeaders who joined him for the service told off the opposition leaders planning demonstrations saying Kenyans had moved on and were only expecting to be served.\n\n\"There's a time for everything. Kenyans are tired of politics. They elected us and now we have jobs to deliver. People are demanding results. We won't allow anyone to destroy properties belonging to our people in Nairobi. We will protect our people's property from any violent protesters,\" said Governor Johnson Sakaja who thanked the DP for spearheading the cleaning of Nairobi River.\n\nEmbakasi Central MP Mejja Donk said those planning demonstrations should be allowed to do so as long as they remained peaceful.\n\n\"They can demonstrate as long as it's peaceful. They should not be allowed to touch people's property,\" he said.\n\nOther leaders who joined the DP were Nominated Senators Karen Nyamu and Tabitha Mutinda, MPs Mwafrika Augustine (Roysambu), James Gakuya (Embakasi North), Onesmus Ngogoyo (Kajiado North), Peter Irungu (Kangema), Eric Wamumbi (Mathira), Machua Waithaka (Kiambu Town), Betty Maina (Murang'a Woman Rep), Mwangi Karobia (Eala), Ann Wamuratha (Kiambu Woman Rep), John Wanjiku (Kiambaa), David Kiaraho (Ol Kalou), James Wamacukuru (Kabete) and Njoroge Kururia (Gatundu North).",

                    "body": "Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has threatened to name top officials in retired President Uhuru Kenyatta's government who allegedly looted at least Sh24 billion from the National Treasury.\n\nHe said those at the centre of the looting spree were cabinet and principal secretaries.\n\nSpeaking during a church service in Nairobi yesterday, the former Mathira MP said the plunder happened between the time the electoral commission announced William Ruto as President-elect on August 15 and the day he was sworn in on September 13 last year.\n\nIn that time, said DP Gachagua, Kenya lost more than Sh24 billion, which was allegedly embezzled by the individuals he has vowed to name soon.\n\n\"In the next few days, I will be releasing details of billions of shillings looted from public coffers in the last three months of the Uhuru administration,\" said Mr Gachagua. \"I will announce the ministers and PSs responsible so that Kenyans can know.\"\n\nAlso Read: Ruto, Gachagua play 'good cop, bad cop'\n\nTwo days earlier, while speaking during an event in Serena Hotel, Nairobi, the Deputy President had alleged that top officials in the previous administration had stolen Sh16 billion before President Ruto was sworn in.\n\nHe claimed Sh10 billion was stolen during the Presidential election petition while another Sh6 billion was pilfered two days before the August 9 polls.\n\nIn the sensational revelations, the second-in-command further claimed Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party leader Raila Odinga was forced to file the petition against his wishes. The DP claimed the presidential petition before the Supreme Court was used as a smokescreen by the \"Uhuru men\" to wipe clean the country's coffers.\n\n\"When they saw the election was not going their way, they carted away the billions in sacks. [Raila didn't want] the petition, He was forced to lodge it to allow them ...to loot more public resources,\" said the 58-year-old.\n\nThe DP further alleged that the police air wing at Wilson Airport was where the money was being received before being loaded onto an aeroplane to be taken to people's homes.\n\nAlso Read: Uhuru allies - Here is our plan to make Ruto a one-term President\n\nMr Gachagua maintained that he was not crazy when he said during the inauguration ceremony last year that the Kenya Kwanza administration inherited empty public coffers.\n\n\"I said we got nothing at the National Treasury and they thought I was crazy. We found a broke country with nothing and the little that was remaining they stole during the transition. We have started from scratch,\" he said.\n\nIn a veiled reference to the \"Handshake\" pact between Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga, the DP compared the two to pickpockets who \"steal from you but when you raise the alarm they gang up on you and label you the thief.\"\n\n\"These fellows who kept on shouting that they cannot hand over the country to thieves ... are the same people who have stolen money belonging to Kenyans,\" said the DP. \"They kept calling people thieves yet they are the top thieves. They behaved like pickpockets at Kencom,\" he added.",

                    "body": "\"Even Raila Odinga did not want to file the petition but he was pushed to do so to give them room to steal public money,\" DP Gachagua.\n\nDeputy President Rigathi Gachagua now says he will name individuals from the previous regime who stole billions of shillings as the country focused on the August 2022 General Election results.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday, March 5, at Jesus Winner Ministry, Roysambu, Gachagua claimed that senior government officials who included Cabinet Secretaries went on a looting spree soon after President William Ruto was declared the winner by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).\n\nAccording to the Deputy President, the officials initiated the massive theft of up to Sh24 billion when it became apparent that President Ruto had won against their candidate Azimio's Raila Odinga and there would be no turning back.\n\n\"On realising that the election was lost, they stole all the money and transported it in gunny bags. Between the day IEBC announced Mr Ruto as President and the time he was sworn in they looted more than Sh24 billion,\" Gachagua alleged.\n\nThe petition, the DP added, was a cover to allow the powerful government officials-whose details he promised to give-to empty public coffers without raising suspicion.\n\n\"Even the Mzee (presidential candidate Odinga) did not want to file the petition but he was pushed to do so to give them room to steal public money between the time of the hearing of the petition and the swearing in,\" he said.\n\nMr Gachagua explained that the looted money was transported via Wilson Airport -- police airwing -- to private homes.\n\n\"They were aware that the case was lost and so they wanted to loot and go their way. In the next few days I will tell Kenyans who stole the money,\" he said recalling that he was castigated for saying this truth on the day of inauguration.\n\nOn Sunday, the DP said the government was focused on bringing down the cost of living and would stop at nothing to ensure that there was no monopoly in the production of gas and cylinders.\n\n\"We need more competition so gas prices can come down. That's what will happen, you can make a lot of noise but it will come down. It's the same thing with milk. We are opening that sector for more competition,\" the DP stated.",

Furthermore, he reiterated that the Kenya Kwanza government inherited a dilapidated economy from President Uhuru's regime.\n\n\"I said during my inauguration about the country we inherited...some people thought I was being mischievous. We inherited a dilapidated country, the coffers were empty, the stores were empty, not even rats were there because there was nothing to eat,\" said the DP.\n\n\"We have started building this country from scratch. All the good work that President Mwai Kibaki did in 10 years was totally destroyed. All the good work Kibaki did of building a strong economy, of having thriving businesses, of allowing people to trade freely, of making sure there is money circulating in the economy, all of it was destroyed especially during the handshake era.\"",

Two days before the August 9 General Elections, they stole Sh6 billion and pretended to sell some shares from Telkom,\" he said.\n\nIt is understood that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has already commenced investigations into the acquisition of unexplained wealth by influential officials who served under Kenyatta.",

                    "body": "Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has made a bold declaration to reveal the extent of corruption in the former regime.\n\nSpeaking during a church service at Jesus Winner Ministry in Roysambu Nairobi, Gachagua promised to release a detailed report on how billions of shillings were swindled from public coffers in the last three months of the previous administration.\n\n\"In the next few days, I will be releasing details of billions of shillings looted from the public coffers in the last three months of the last administration. I will announce the ministers and the PSs responsible so that Kenyans can know,\" he stated.\n\nGachagua also alleged that the move to challenge William Ruto's election as President-elect in the Supreme Court was a scheme to empty the coffers.\n\nHe claimed that over Sh24 billion was looted between the time the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) announced Ruto as President and the day he was sworn in.\n\n\"They carried them in sacks, to allow them room for looting when the case was ongoing. At the police airwing in Wilson Airport is where money was being brought in sacks, packed into the planes, and taken to different homes\" Gachagua revealed.\n\nThe Deputy President emphasized that he will not shy away from telling Kenyans the truth and will be at the forefront of exposing how public money was squandered.\n\n\"I will be releasing details of billions of shillings looted from the public coffers... so that Kenyans can know,\" he reiterated.\n\nThe Azimio leadership's proposal to hold a protest against the soaring cost of living was criticized by the DP. He asserted that the current Kenya Kwanza administration has effectively reduced the price of flour from Sh230 to the current Sh180.",

Also, between the time IEBC announced the results and the time William Ruto was sworn in, they looted more than sh24 billion in this country yet they knew the petition was going nowhere.\"\n\nHe added that the money was being transported in sacks and cartons to the plane at Wilson Airport's Police air-wing, and then delivered to several Members of Parliament's residences.\n\nYet, he vowed that he would soon publish the names of those who had received the money.\n\nThis statement follows a day after on Friday during dinner at Crown Plaza in Nyeri when he said that taxpayers' money running into sh6 billions, including funds meant to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, ware stolen by senior government officials.\n\nHe added that the public coffers were raided by the officials as the Supreme Court case against their victory was going on.\n\n\"Money was stolen from Covid when people were dying. Two days before the August 9 General Elections, they stole Sh6 billion and pretended to sell some shares from Telkom,\" he said.\n\n\"When there was a case before the Supreme Court, they stole another Sh10 billion purportedly to pay some contractors.\"",

When there was a case before the Supreme Court, they stole another Sh10 billion purportedly to pay some contractors,\" Gachagua said.\n\n\"Money was being brought in cartons at Wilson Airport and flown in choppers to people's homes. And these are the people now unasikia wanaambiwa kuja andika statement kidogo, anaingia ndege anatoroka. And these people, who are thieves, were calling others thieves. They ripped this country....

                    "body": "Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has sensationally claimed senior government officials stole billions from the treasury durint the political season.\n\nThough he did not mention them by name, DP Gachagua claimed the officials initially looted Central Bank two days before the August 9, 2022 polls.\n\nThe second-in-command alleges the officials stole Sh6 billion under the pretence of selling shares of government owned Telkom.\n\nFurther, he says the officials again looted when the Supreme Court was hearing the Azimio la Umoja party leader Raila Odinga's petition.\n\n\"When there was a case in the Supreme Court, they stole another Sh10 billion purportedly to pay some contractors. Money was being brought in cartons at Wilson Airport and flown in choppers to people's homes,\" he said.\n\nHe then suggested former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i was one of them.\n\n\"Some of them were recently asked to come and record statements but instead fled,\" he said.\n\nDP Gachagua did not explain why the suspected thieves have not been arrested and charged before the court as per the law.\n\nMatiang'i's home was recently raided by police.\n\nThe Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) summoned him to record a statement but he failed to honour the summons.\n\nHis lawyer Danstan Omari says the former powerful Cabinet Secretary has not been served the summons issued by DCI.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has launched investigations into how Dr Matiang'i made his wealth. It has asked the public service to give a breakdown on how he accumulated his wealth between 2013 and 2022 when he served in the cabinet under a number of portfolios.\n\nCentral Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Dr Patrick Njoroge has in the past claimed that during the final term of President Uhuru Kenyatta's reign, there was a plot by some government personnel in the finance docket to sabotage the country's economy as was the case during the infamous Goldenberg scandal.\n\nDr. Njoroge revealed that a section of government officers had infiltrated the public coffers with the intention of embezzling funds in the foreign exchange department but the CBK management has since managed to deal with.\n\nAlso read: Xtian Dela exposed for abandoning his mum\n\nMan in court for assaulting hotel owner over Sh150 bill\n\nMaina Kageni: I've been privileged to meet three Kenyan presidents",

Two days before the August 9 General Elections, they stole Sh6 billion and pretended to sell some shares from Telkom. When there was a case before the Supreme Court, they stole another Sh10 billion purportedly to pay some contractors,\" he said during the dinner at Crowne Plaza Hotel, Nairobi.\n\nThe Deputy President added that the stolen money was taken to the officials' homes.\n\n\"Money was brought in cartons from Wilson Airport and flown in choppers to people's homes,\" he added in what signals a major investigation to be opened on the former officials who served in Kenyatta's government.",

Money was being brought in cartons and flew with choppers to peoples' homes,\"\n\nGachagua, on the other hand, did not name the former government officials who were involved in the Ksh 16 billion scandal.\n\nAt the same time, Gachagua noted that Kenya had been blacklisted by international lenders due to the debt left by Uhuru's administration.\n\nHe did, however, express optimism, announcing that the embargo had been lifted, allowing the government to seek finance from international lenders.\n\n\"But I want to give you hope. Before we came, international lenders had blacklisted us, but we have now been given a thumbs up. We can now engage international lenders if we want any credit,\" he said.\n\nHis announcement comes after the Cabinet decided to jettison the country's Ksh 10 trillion debt ceiling in favor of a floating objective of 55% of GDP.\n\n\"In keeping with the global best practice on the debt limit policy, and in furtherance of the administration quest to realise inter-generational equity through sustainable debt management, Cabinet considered the legislative proposal to harmonise the definition of public debt and the attendant regulations,\" the Cabinet stated in part.",

When there was a case before the Supreme Court, they stole another Sh10 billion purportedly to pay some contractors,\" he said.\n\nGachagua spoke on Friday evening at a Nairobi Hotel where he attended a high-profile meeting with professionals from Nyeri County.\n\n\"Money was being brought in cartons at Wilson Airport and flown in choppers to people's homes. And these are the people now unasikia wanaambiwa kuja andika statement kidogo, anaingia ndege anatoroka. And these people, who are thieves, were calling others thieves. They ripped this country.... They took everything,\" Gachagua said.\n\nThe DP said the current sorry state of the country's economy was trigered by the former government's wanton looting of public funds.\n\n\"I said during my inauguration about the country we inherited... some people thought I was being mischievous. We inherited a dilapidated country, the coffers were empty, the stores were empty, not even rats were there because there was nothing to eat,\" he said.\n\n\"We have started building this country from scratch. All the good work that President Mwai Kibaki did in 10 years was totally destroyed. All the good work Kibaki did of building a strong economy, of having thriving businesses, of allowing people to trade freely, of making sure there is money circulating in the economy, all of it was destroyed especially during the handshake era.\"",

                    "body": "Gachagua alleged that the officials stole Ksh6 billion in the pretence of selling shares prior to the 2022 general elections...\n\nDeputy President Rigathi Gachagua pointed a finger at senior officials in former President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration who stole Ksh16 billion from public coffers before the handover to President William Ruto.\n\nAddressing Tetu Constituency professionals converged in Nairobi on Friday, March 3, Gachagua alleged that the officials stole Ksh6 billion in the pretence of selling shares prior to the 2022 general elections.\n\nThey also allegedly stole a further Ksh10 billion following President Ruto's Supreme Court victory in the presidential petition filed by Azimio la Umoja leader, Raila Odinga.\n\nAccording to Gachagua, the funds were packed in boxes and transported to Wilson Airport where they would be flown in choppers to people's houses.\n\n\"Two days before the elections, they stole Ksh6 billion and pretended to sell some shares. When there was a case before the Supreme Court, they stole another Ksh10 billion purportedly to pay some contractors.\n\n\"Money was being brought in cartons at Wilson Airport and flown in choppers to people's homes. And these are the people now you are hearing are being summoned to record a few statements, they board a flight to escape. And these people, who are thieves, were calling others thieves. They ripped this country, they took everything,\" he stated.\n\nGachagua went ahead to blame the officials for the alleged theft of the funds in wanton circumstances, contributing to the dilapidated state of the economy. Furthermore, he reiterated that the Kenya Kwanza government inherited a dilapidated economy from President Uhuru's regime.\n\n\"I said during my inauguration about the country we inherited...some people thought I was being mischievous. We inherited a dilapidated country, the coffers were empty, the stores were empty, not even rats were there because there was nothing to eat,\" said the DP.\n\n\"We have started building this country from scratch. All the good work that President Mwai Kibaki did in 10 years was totally destroyed. All the good work Kibaki did of building a strong economy, of having thriving businesses, of allowing people to trade freely, of making sure there is money circulating in the economy, all of it was destroyed especially during the handshake era.\"\n\nHe said domestic borrowing from commercial banks at high-interest rates also contributed to the strain on the economy as the borrowers had also owned the same banks and could not negotiate interest to be charged, something he added the Kenya Kwanza government has since moved to stop with immediate effect to allow the country to recover.\n\nHe however noted there was hope and that the Ruto administration would fix the economy.\n\n\"I want to give you hope. Before we came into power we were blacklisted by international lenders but now everything is okay for we have been given a thumbs up,\" noted the DP.\n\nNeither the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) nor the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) had issued a response to Gachagua's allegations by the time of publication.\n\nPresident William Ruto and his predecessor, Uhuru, were reported in late September 2022 to have spent up to Ksh579 million in the run-up to the month of June 2022 amidst campaigns for the August 9 general elections.\n\nThe millions were spent on trips within the country and increased amidst vicious campaigns for the State House job, with Uhuru backing Raila for the presidency. According to the Controller of Budget report, the increased travel saw Ruto and Uhuru's offices increase their spending on trips by 191.3 per cent from the Ksh198.79 million they spent in the three months to June 2021.\n\nThe Ksh579 million was equivalent to 66.2 per cent of the Ksh873.90 million the Presidency spent on trips in the year to June, reflecting the increased travel by the duo ahead of the elections.\n\nThe budget office data showed that the national government spend Ksh20.17 billion on local and foreign travel in the year to June, reflecting a 41.9 per cent jump from Ksh14.21 billion spent the year earlier.",

                    "body": "Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has sensationally claimed that former President Uhuru Kenyatta's men carted away 16 Billion shillings days before President William Ruto took over.\n\nGachagua who was speaking at a Nairobi hotel maintained that the money heist was executed in phases with the amount in question loaded in carton boxes and ferried away in choppers.\n\nThe choppers took the hefty sum to certain individuals' homes.\n\nThe last phase of the heist, according to Gachagua, saw Ksh 10 Billion loaded in boxes and carted away as the presidential election petition was going on.\n\nThe first phase which he maintains was executed just two days before the August 09 elections saw 6 billion taken away.\n\n\"Two days before the elections, they stole Ksh.6 billion and pretended to sell some shares from Telkom. When there was a case before the Supreme Court, they stole another Ksh.10 billion purportedly to pay some contractors.\n\n\"Money was being brought in cartons at Wilson Airport and flown in choppers to people's homes. And these are the people now unaskia wanaambiwa kuja andika statement kidogo, anaingia ndege anatoroka. And these people, who are thieves, were calling others thieves. They ripped this country.... They took everything,\" Gachagua said during a meeting with professionals from Tetu.\n\nDespite the weighty claims, the Deputy President did not name anyone involved in the looting spree or any steps taken to recover the money.\n\nHe maintained that the looting spree is to blame for the current state of the economy as the Kenya Kwanza administration inherited a broke government.\n\n\"I said during my inauguration about the country we inherited... some people thought I was being mischievous. We inherited a dilapidated country, the coffers were empty, the stores were empty, not even rats were there because there was nothing to eat.\n\n\"We have started building this country from scratch. All the good work that President Mwai Kibaki did in 10 years was totally destroyed. All the good work Kibaki did of building a strong economy, of having thriving businesses, of allowing people to trade freely, of making sure there is money circulating in the economy, all of it was destroyed especially during the handshake era.\" He added.\n\nREAD: 2 Lessons DP Gachagua wants Matiang'i to copy from Kenya Kwanza politicians\n\nThe second in command is on record blaming the previous regime for the challenges they continue to face in the backdrop of disillusioned voters whose patience is running thin after a number of election pledges failed to be achieved, key among them being taming the high cost of living.\n\nNotably, President Ruto had promised to dismantle cartels as soon as he puts the bible down after his swearing in and get maize floor to retail at Ksh 100 for a packet of 2KG.",
