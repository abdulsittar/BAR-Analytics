                    "body": "Campbell Jamieson, General Manager - Commercial at the International Cricket Council (ICC), said the game is growing rapidly in Germany, which is home to a sizable South Asian population\n\nOften criticised for not being able to make cricket a global sport, the ICC has pinned its hopes on South Asian migrants in Germany and USA to expand the game's footprint in the untapped markets of Europe and Americas.\n\nCampbell Jamieson, General Manager - Commercial at the International Cricket Council (ICC), said the game is growing rapidly in Germany, which is home to a sizable South Asian population.\n\nThe ICC has 104 members in its fold but only 12 out of them play Test cricket.\n\n\"Cricket is expanding. A really good example of that is Germany where in the last five years we have gone from 50 cricket teams to 500 teams and we are struggling to keep up with the infrastructure and the governance of the sport in that country. We need to ensure that cricketers in that country always get to play the sport they love,\" Jamieson told PTI on Wednesday.\n\nInitially, economic migration from cricket-crazy India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka fuelled the sport's growth in Germany but of late the rising number of Afghan refugees are taking the game beyond the big cities.\n\nAccording to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees statistics up to 2016, Germany had at least 46,292 registered Afghan refugees in the country.\n\n\"Migrant population from cricket playing countries is contributing to the growth of the game in Germany. And if you mix that with local players, you then have inclusive growth. The migration of people from South Asia aids that growth and we are fortunate in that case,\" said Jamieson.\n\nThe sport is also growing fast in USA, something that was recently acknowledged by former West Indies batsman Ricardo Powell, who is now a selector with the USA national team.\n\n\"If you look at the current national team, 70 percent of the team members are of Indian descent. There is a huge Indian population in the US and we have 250 clubs playing the game. That says a lot about cricket in the US,\" Powell had told PTI.\n\nAt the moment, there is no ICC recognised association in the USA but the country is on its way to regaining the membership, said Jamieson.\n\n\"North America has also seen great expansion thanks to the migration of people from the Caribbean and India of course. We need to harness that opportunity to allow people to play the game they love,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on ICC's bid for women's cricket's inclusion in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Jamieson sounded upbeat.\n\n\"Hopefully, the bid is successful and that will take the women's game further forward. From a cricket and Commonwealth Games' perspective both compliment each other really well. CWG can utilise the power, strength and support that cricket has throughout the world.\n\n\"There is a rich cricketing history in the UK, great facilities and infrastructure but as I said, it is just an application along with number of sports.\"\n\nOn the ever-increasing threat of corruption in cricket with the advent of T20 leagues around the world, Jamieson said it is imperative that the sport is governed properly.\n\n\"In my view, the growth of leagues globally is good news for the game but at the same time, the cricket needs to be governed and administered properly,\" he added.",

                    "title": "ICC banks heavily on migrants to fuel cricket's growth in Germany",
                    "body": "Campbell Jamieson, General Manager - Commercial at the International Cricket Council (ICC), said the game is growing rapidly in Germany, which is home to a sizable South Asian population.\n\nThe ICC has 104 members in its fold but only 12 out of them play Test cricket.\n\n\"Cricket is expanding. A really good example of that is Germany where in the last five years we have gone from 50 cricket teams to 500 teams and we are struggling to keep up with the infrastructure and the governance of the sport in that country. We need to ensure that cricketers in that country always get to play the sport they love,\" Jamieson told PTI on Wednesday.\n\nInitially, economic migration from cricket-crazy India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka fuelled the sport's growth in Germany but of late the rising number of Afghan refugees are taking the game beyond the big cities.\n\nAccording to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees statistics up to 2016, Germany had at least 46,292 registered Afghan refugees in the country.\n\n\"Migrant population from cricket playing countries is contributing to the growth of the game in Germany. And if you mix that with local players, you then have inclusive growth. The migration of people from South Asia aids that growth and we are fortunate in that case,\" said Jamieson.\n\nThe sport is also growing fast in USA, something that was recently acknowledged by former West Indies batsman Ricardo Powell, who is now a selector with the USA national team.\n\n\"If you look at the current national team, 70 percent of the team members are of Indian descent. There is a huge Indian population in the US and we have 250 clubs playing the game. That says a lot about cricket in the US,\" Powell had told PTI.\n\nAt the moment, there is no ICC recognised association in the USA but the country is on its way to regaining the membership, said Jamieson.\n\n\"North America has also seen great expansion thanks to the migration of people from the Caribbean and India of course. We need to harness that opportunity to allow people to play the game they love,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on ICC's bid for women's cricket's inclusion in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Jamieson sounded upbeat.\n\n\"Hopefully, the bid is successful and that will take the women's game further forward. From a cricket and Commonwealth Games' perspective both compliment each other really well. CWG can utilise the power, strength and support that cricket has throughout the world.\n\n\"There is a rich cricketing history in the UK, great facilities and infrastructure but as I said, it is just an application along with number of sports.\"\n\nOn the ever-increasing threat of corruption in cricket with the advent of T20 leagues around the world, Jamieson said it is imperative that the sport is governed properly.\n\n\"In my view, the growth of leagues globally is good news for the game but at the same time, the cricket needs to be governed and administered properly,\" he added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "NEW DELHI: Often criticised for not being able to make cricket a global sport, the ICC has pinned its hopes on South Asian migrants in Germany and USA to expand the game's footprint in the untapped markets of Europe and Americas.\n\nCampbell Jamieson, general manager - commercial at the International Cricket Council (ICC), said the game is growing rapidly in Germany, which is home to a sizable South Asian population.\n\nThe ICC has 104 members in its fold but only 12 out of them play Test cricket.\n\n\"Cricket is expanding. A really good example of that is Germany where in the last five years we have gone from 50 cricket teams to 500 teams and we are struggling to keep up with the infrastructure and the governance of the sport in that country. We need to ensure that cricketers in that country always get to play the sport they love,\" Jamieson told PTI on Wednesday.\n\nInitially, economic migration from cricket-crazy India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka fuelled the sport's growth in Germany but of late the rising number of Afghan refugees are taking the game beyond the big cities.\n\nAccording to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees statistics up to 2016, Germany had at least 46,292 registered Afghan refugees in the country.\n\n\"Migrant population from cricket playing countries is contributing to the growth of the game in Germany. And if you mix that with local players, you then have inclusive growth. The migration of people from South Asia aids that growth and we are fortunate in that case,\" said Jamieson.\n\nThe sport is also growing fast in USA, something that was recently acknowledged by former West Indies batsman Ricardo Powell, who is now a selector with the USA national team.\n\n\"If you look at the current national team, 70 percent of the team members are of Indian descent. There is a huge Indian population in the US and we have 250 clubs playing the game. That says a lot about cricket in the US,\" Powell had told PTI.\n\nAt the moment, there is no ICC recognised association in the USA but the country is on its way to regaining the membership, said Jamieson.\n\n\"North America has also seen great expansion thanks to the migration of people from the Caribbean and India of course. We need to harness that opportunity to allow people to play the game they love,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on ICC's bid for women's cricket's inclusion in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Jamieson sounded upbeat.\n\n\"Hopefully, the bid is successful and that will take the women's game further forward. From a cricket and Commonwealth Games' perspective both compliment each other really well. CWG can utilise the power, strength and support that cricket has throughout the world.\n\n\"There is a rich cricketing history in the UK, great facilities and infrastructure but as I said, it is just an application along with number of sports.\"\n\nOn the ever-increasing threat of corruption in cricket with the advent of T20 leagues around the world, Jamieson said it is imperative that the sport is governed properly.\n\n\"In my view, the growth of leagues globally is good news for the game but at the same time, the cricket needs to be governed and administered properly,\" he added.",

Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images\n\nOften criticised for not being able to make cricket a global sport, the International Cricket Council has pinned its hopes on South Asian migrants in Germany and USA to expand the game's footprint in the untapped markets of Europe and Americas.\n\nCampbell Jamieson, General Manager - Commercial at the International Cricket Council (ICC), said the game is growing rapidly in Germany, which is home to a sizable South Asian population.\n\nThe ICC has 104 members in its fold but only 12 out of them play Test cricket.\n\n\"Cricket is expanding. A really good example of that is Germany where in the last five years we have gone from 50 cricket teams to 500 teams and we are struggling to keep up with the infrastructure and the governance of the sport in that country. We need to ensure that cricketers in that country always get to play the sport they love,\" Jamieson said.\n\nInitially, economic migration from cricket-crazy India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka fuelled the sport's growth in Germany but of late the rising number of Afghan refugees are taking the game beyond the big cities.\n\nAccording to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees statistics up to 2016, Germany had at least 46,292 registered Afghan refugees in the country.\n\n\"Migrant population from cricket playing countries is contributing to the growth of the game in Germany. And if you mix that with local players, you then have inclusive growth. The migration of people from South Asia aids that growth and we are fortunate in that case,\" said Jamieson.\n\nThe sport is also growing fast in USA, something that was recently acknowledged by former West Indies batsman Ricardo Powell, who is now a selector with the USA national team.\n\n\"If you look at the current national team, 70 per cent of the team members are of Indian descent. There is a huge Indian population in the US and we have 250 clubs playing the game. That says a lot about cricket in the US,\" Powell said.\n\nAt the moment, there is no ICC recognised association in the USA but the country is on its way to regaining the membership, said Jamieson.\n\n\"North America has also seen great expansion thanks to the migration of people from the Caribbean and India of course. We need to harness that opportunity to allow people to play the game they love,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on ICC's bid for women's cricket's inclusion in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Jamieson sounded upbeat.\n\n\"Hopefully, the bid is successful and that will take the women's game further forward. From a cricket and Commonwealth Games' perspective both compliment each other really well. CWG can utilise the power, strength and support that cricket has throughout the world.\n\n\"There is a rich cricketing history in the UK, great facilities and infrastructure but as I said, it is just an application along with number of sports.\"\n\nOn the ever-increasing threat of corruption in cricket with the advent of T20 leagues around the world, Jamieson said it is imperative that the sport is governed properly.\n\n\"In my view, the growth of leagues globally is good news for the game but at the same time, the cricket needs to be governed and administered properly,\" he added.",

                    "body": "Initially, economic migration from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka fuelled the sport's growth in Germany but of late the rising number of Afghan refugees are taking the game beyond the big cities.\n\nOften criticised for not being able to make cricket a global sport, the ICC has pinned its hopes on South Asian migrants in Germany and USA to expand the game's footprint in the untapped markets of Europe and Americas. Campbell Jamieson, General Manager - Commercial at the International Cricket Council (ICC), said the game is growing rapidly in Germany, which is home to a sizable South Asian population.\n\nThe ICC has 104 members in its fold but only 12 out of them play Test cricket. \"Cricket is expanding. A really good example of that is Germany where in the last five years we have gone from 50 cricket teams to 500 teams and we are struggling to keep up with the infrastructure and the governance of the sport in that country. We need to ensure that cricketers in that country always get to play the sport they love,\" Jamieson told PTI on Wednesday.\n\nInitially, economic migration from cricket-crazy India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka fuelled the sport's growth in Germany but of late the rising number of Afghan refugees are taking the game beyond the big cities.\n\nAccording to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees statistics up to 2016, Germany had at least 46,292 registered Afghan refugees in the country. \"Migrant population from cricket playing countries is contributing to the growth of the game in Germany. And if you mix that with local players, you then have inclusive growth. The migration of people from South Asia aids that growth and we are fortunate in that case,\" said Jamieson.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe sport is also growing fast in USA, something that was recently acknowledged by former West Indies batsman Ricardo Powell, who is now a selector with the USA national team.\n\n\"If you look at the current national team, 70 percent of the team members are of Indian descent. There is a huge Indian population in the US and we have 250 clubs playing the game. That says a lot about cricket in the US,\" Powell had told PTI.\n\nAt the moment, there is no ICC recognised association in the USA but the country is on its way to regaining the membership, said Jamieson. \"North America has also seen great expansion thanks to the migration of people from the Caribbean and India of course. We need to harness that opportunity to allow people to play the game they love,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on ICC's bid for women's cricket's inclusion in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Jamieson sounded upbeat. \"Hopefully, the bid is successful and that will take the women's game further forward. From a cricket and Commonwealth Games' perspective both compliment each other really well. CWG can utilise the power, strength and support that cricket has throughout the world.\n\n\"There is a rich cricketing history in the UK, great facilities and infrastructure but as I said, it is just an application along with number of sports.\"\n\nOn the ever-increasing threat of corruption in cricket with the advent of T20 leagues around the world, Jamieson said it is imperative that the sport is governed properly. \"In my view, the growth of leagues globally is good news for the game but at the same time, the cricket needs to be governed and administered properly,\" he added.",

                    "body": "Campbell Jamieson, General Manager - Commercial at the International Cricket Council (ICC), said the game is growing rapidly in Germany, which is home to a sizable South Asian population.\n\nOften criticised for not being able to make cricket a global sport, the ICC has pinned its hopes on South Asian migrants in Germany and USA to expand the game's footprint in the untapped markets of Europe and Americas.\n\nCampbell Jamieson, General Manager - Commercial at the International Cricket Council (ICC), said the game is growing rapidly in Germany, which is home to a sizable South Asian population.\n\nThe ICC has 104 members in its fold but only 12 out of them play Test cricket.\n\n\"Cricket is expanding. A really good example of that is Germany where in the last five years we have gone from 50 cricket teams to 500 teams and we are struggling to keep up with the infrastructure and the governance of the sport in that country. We need to ensure that cricketers in that country always get to play the sport they love,\" Jamieson said on Wednesday.\n\nAlso Read -\u2009ICC Test Rankings: Yasir Shah enters top-10 after magical spell in Dubai\n\nInitially, economic migration from cricket-crazy India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka fuelled the sport's growth in Germany but of late the rising number of Afghan refugees are taking the game beyond the big cities.\n\nAccording to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees statistics up to 2016, Germany had at least 46,292 registered Afghan refugees in the country.\n\n\"Migrant population from cricket playing countries is contributing to the growth of the game in Germany. And if you mix that with local players, you then have inclusive growth. The migration of people from South Asia aids that growth and we are fortunate in that case,\" said Jamieson.\n\nThe sport is also growing fast in USA, something that was recently acknowledged by former West Indies batsman Ricardo Powell, who is now a selector with the USA national team.\n\n\"If you look at the current national team, 70 percent of the team members are of Indian descent. There is a huge Indian population in the US and we have 250 clubs playing the game. That says a lot about cricket in the US,\" Powell had said.\n\n\"At the moment, there is no ICC recognised association in the USA but the country is on its way to regaining the membership,\" said Jamieson.\n\n\"North America has also seen great expansion thanks to the migration of people from the Caribbean and India of course. We need to harness that opportunity to allow people to play the game they love,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on ICC's bid for women's cricket's inclusion in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Jamieson sounded upbeat.\n\nAlso Read: Shikhar Dhawan reveals emotional moment after Test omission\n\n\"Hopefully, the bid is successful and that will take the women's game further forward. From a cricket and Commonwealth Games' perspective both compliment each other really well. CWG can utilise the power, strength and support that cricket has throughout the world.\n\n\"There is a rich cricketing history in the UK, great facilities and infrastructure but as I said, it is just an application along with number of sports.\"\n\nOn the ever-increasing threat of corruption in cricket with the advent of T20 leagues around the world, Jamieson said it is imperative that the sport is governed properly.\n\n\"In my view, the growth of leagues globally is good news for the game but at the same time, the cricket needs to be governed and administered properly,\" he added.",

                    "body": "New Delhi, Nov 28 (PTI) Often criticised for not being able to make cricket a global sport, the ICC has pinned its hopes on South Asian migrants in Germany and USA to expand the game's footprint in the untapped markets of Europe and Americas.\n\nCampbell Jamieson, General Manager - Commercial at the International Cricket Council (ICC), said the game is growing rapidly in Germany, which is home to a sizable South Asian population.\n\nThe ICC has 104 members in its fold but only 12 out of them play Test cricket.\n\n\"Cricket is expanding. A really good example of that is Germany where in the last five years we have gone from 50 cricket teams to 500 teams and we are struggling to keep up with the infrastructure and the governance of the sport in that country. We need to ensure that cricketers in that country always get to play the sport they love,\" Jamieson told PTI on Wednesday.\n\nInitially, economic migration from cricket-crazy India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka fuelled the sport's growth in Germany but of late the rising number of Afghan refugees are taking the game beyond the big cities.\n\nAccording to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees statistics up to 2016, Germany had at least 46,292 registered Afghan refugees in the country.\n\n\"Migrant population from cricket playing countries is contributing to the growth of the game in Germany. And if you mix that with local players, you then have inclusive growth. The migration of people from South Asia aids that growth and we are fortunate in that case,\" said Jamieson.\n\nThe sport is also growing fast in USA, something that was recently acknowledged by former West Indies batsman Ricardo Powell, who is now a selector with the USA national team.\n\n\"If you look at the current national team, 70 percent of the team members are of Indian descent. There is a huge Indian population in the US and we have 250 clubs playing the game. That says a lot about cricket in the US,\" Powell had told PTI.\n\nAt the moment, there is no ICC recognised association in the USA but the country is on its way to regaining the membership, said Jamieson.\n\n\"North America has also seen great expansion thanks to the migration of people from the Caribbean and India of course. We need to harness that opportunity to allow people to play the game they love,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on ICC's bid for women's cricket's inclusion in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Jamieson sounded upbeat.\n\n\"Hopefully, the bid is successful and that will take the women's game further forward. From a cricket and Commonwealth Games' perspective both compliment each other really well. CWG can utilise the power, strength and support that cricket has throughout the world.\n\n\"There is a rich cricketing history in the UK, great facilities and infrastructure but as I said, it is just an application along with number of sports.\"\n\nOn the ever-increasing threat of corruption in cricket with the advent of T20 leagues around the world, Jamieson said it is imperative that the sport is governed properly.\n\n\"In my view, the growth of leagues globally is good news for the game but at the same time, the cricket needs to be governed and administered properly,\" he added.

He did not have any comment to make on the fact men's cricket was not pushed by the ICC.\n\n\"The ICC's bid to include women's T20 cricket in the Commonwealth Games is an exciting prospect for our White ferns and the game of cricket as a whole,\" he said.\n\n\"To have the ICC lead the way in taking cricket to new audiences and inspiring more young girls to take up the game fits perfectly with what NZC is trying to achieve in our own backyard.\"\n\nWhite Ferns captain Amy Satterthwaite was thrilled her side could be in contention for a games medal.\n\n\"Having just attended the T20 World Cup and seeing the uptake of women's cricket, it's fantastic to hear it may now be included in the Commonwealth Games,\" she said.\n\n\"We know as players we have a responsibility to inspire the next generation of young cricketers to get involved in the sport we all love. The Commonwealth Games seems like the perfect vehicle to take the women's game around the world.\"\n\nThe ICC said the application for inclusion of women's cricket at the games is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.\n\nICC initially placed a bid for women's T20 when the games were to be hosted in Durban, and the bid was just a continuation of that, with the new location of Birmingham.\n\n\"Our research is telling us that cricket has just over one billion adult fans and 70 per cent of them want to watch more top quality women's competition,\" said Furlong.\n\nShe said the games would be a good platform for the women's game on an international scale.\n\n\"The Games would also open the women's game up to a different audience and help us accelerate its growth.\n\n\"The quicker we can fulfil the demand that's there, the quicker it can become more self sustainable and greater investment can be driven in not just internationally but domestically too.\"\n\nThe bid proposes an eight team T20 event played in two pools of four teams and totalling 16 matches in eight days held at two venues.",

                    "body": "THE International Cricket Council (ICC) has confirmed that it has submitted a bid for the inclusion of T20 women's cricket into the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2022.\n\nThe bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see one of the world's fastest growing women's team sports apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nCricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where South Africa stood on top of the podium.\n\nThe application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.\n\nICC chief executive David Richardson said: \"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth.\n\n\"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 percent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket. If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity.\n\n\"This partnership has the potential to go way beyond a sporting event that can be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of fans in Birmingham, the UK and the rest of the world. I believe the players who reflect the diversity of this audience will send a powerful message to young women in Birmingham and beyond about the potential that they can achieve through sport.\n\n\"We would like cricket to lead the way in the Commonwealth in inspiring more young girls to take up sport regardless of their background or culture. There's a saying that 'you can't be it if you can't see it' -- imagine the impact of millions of young girls around the world watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage.\"\n\nECB chairman Colin Graves said: \"As chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, I've always been keen to support any steps that can help us to grow the game, both at home and across the globe.\n\n\"The women's game is going from strength to strength, attracting strong crowds and drawing girls and boys to cricket - it's an important strategic focus and a huge opportunity.\n\n\"To have cricket play a part in the Commonwealth Games, seen by a wide and diverse audience in the UK and played out across the world, would be a real boost for cricket and the women's game.\"\n\nECB chief executive Tom Harrison said: \"The appetite for the women's game is huge, we have the facilities to stage a great tournament and there is a big opportunity for growth.\n\n\"As we saw with the ICC Women's World Cup here in 2017, a global event can have a huge impact on inspiring women and girls to get involved in cricket - playing, watching and volunteering.\n\n\"Locally, Birmingham has the second largest South Asian population in the UK and we are already working hard to engage these communities in cricket through our South Asian Action Plan, which we launched in May.\n\n\"Birmingham 2022 would be a great opportunity to showcase cricket around the Commonwealth and give cricket a huge platform for growth locally, nationally and globally.\"\n\nEngland women's captain Heather Knight said: \"It's hugely exciting that women's cricket is bidding to become part of the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\"So much of what we do is about trying to get young girls and boys to pick up a bat and a ball and start playing the sport and the exposure of being in a global event like the Commonwealth Games would be so valuable for that.\n\n\"We saw earlier this year when the England Netball team won the gold medal on the Gold Coast that there's a massive opportunity to inspire and to grow the game and we'd love to be a part of that.\"\n\nIndia women's captain Harmanpreet Kaur said: \"It's a great idea, and we'll get more fan following when we introduce cricket to Commonwealth Games.\n\n\"We can get more fans, we can get more games to improve our cricket. I'm really happy we're going to get more games to play.\"\n\nClare Connor, ECB director of women's cricket and chair of the ICC Women's Committee, said: \"The inclusion of women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games would give our sport another huge opportunity to inspire girls all around the world to believe that cricket is for them, to drive female participation and to continue to steer cricket towards being a truly gender neutral sport.\n\n\"We know the value of these opportunities having staged the ICC Womens' World Cup 2017 on these shores. We watched our own England team lift the trophy in front of a full house at Lord's with more than 180 million watching on television around the globe. Events such as these play a vital role in driving equal opportunity for women and girls in sport, providing wonderful heroes, role models and inspirational moments in time.\n\n\"In my roles with both ECB and ICC, I am excited about women's cricket being front and centre in the new strategies of both the ECB and global cricket and our participation in the Commonwealth Games would significantly enhance our chances of delivering on our ambitious strategic objectives for the women's game around participation, fans and high performance.\"\n\nThe bid to the Commonwealth Games Federation proposes an eight team T20 event played in two pools of four teams and totalling 16 matches in eight days held at two venues.\n\nThe ICC has the unanimous backing of its Members and Board of Directors to pursue the inclusion of women's cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\n\nThere has been full commitment from all Members to celebrate the inextricable link between cricket and the Commonwealth and to delivering a world class cricket event at Birmingham 2022 that grows the relevance and reach of both cricket and the Commonwealth Games.\n\nAn ICC and ECB delegation will present its bid for the inclusion of women's cricket in the Birmingham 2022 sporting programme to an assessment panel early next month.",

                    "body": "CHENNAI: Women's cricket is on the rise. Monday was another day confirming that. The International Cricket Council said it has submitted a bid for women's T20 cricket to be included at the 2022 Commonwealth Games (CWG) in Birmingham. After conducting the Women's World T20 in the Caribbean as a standalone event, this is seen as a step to popularise the women's sport.\n\nThe CWG bid has been made in partnership with England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). If it is successful, the top eight T20 sides would take part.\n\n\"We would like cricket to lead the way in the Commonwealth in inspiring more young girls to take up sport regardless of background or culture. Imagine the impact of millions of young girls watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage,\" said ICC chief executive David Richardson.\n\nFrom few followers a decade ago to record-breaking viewership for last year's 50-over World Cup, women's cricket has come a long way. In India alone, a whopping 150 million saw the tournament. This speaks volumes of interest increasing, in terms of investment of time and money.\n\n\"Women's cricket is gaining momentum. It (CWG inclusion) will be a big opportunity to showcase their mettle worldwide, which in turn will inspire more girls to be actively involved in cricket. Women's game is on the right track. The World T20 held as a standalone event was a huge stepping stone,\" says former India coach and player Sudha Shah.\n\nMen's cricket has been part of CWG once before -- South Africa winning the competition in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur. Sixteen teams participated including top ones like India, Australia alongside teams such as Malaysia and Canada. Matches were played in the 50-over format with List A status.\n\nBut with increased awareness now, former India international Mamatha Maben believes the new step will enhance the image and value. \"Men have so many tournaments and they are recognised widely. For girls, it will be a platform to perform on the world stage. We had cricket in CWG once, but it didn't work because it was an amateur thing. Most teams sent their second string of players. Now it will be played professionally. It will add one more tournament to the calendar that will be publicised and followed. T20 is the ideal format for such an event. The fast-paced game will draw more audience,\" said the 48-year-old.\n\nWith the Commonwealth Games Federation's one of the three core values being equality -- the other two are humanity and destiny -- the move to include women's cricket is a testament of things heading up in right direction for female athletes.\n\n(srinidhi@newindianexpress.com)",

                    "body": "Commonwealth Games alumnus Chantal Petitclerc, pictured above at the 2014 Games in Scotland, believes the Games are the most inclusive and a model to follow. (Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press)\n\nOn the heels of Black Friday and Cyber Monday there is Giving Tuesday.\n\nIn the wake of all that consumerism comes a nod to charity and along with it, the hope that a wider community can aspire to share in the collective wealth.\n\nUncharacteristically, an increasing number of asks from what has become an international movement of benevolence, are coming from sport.\n\nThere are local sports organizations soliciting support as well as major corporations who create opportunity for less fortunate kids on various fields of play. Now there are even a number of requests from Canada's high-performance athletes themselves.\n\nOne striking example is the Commonwealth Games Foundation of Canada's initiative, which comes in the form of an athlete-led, public-fundraising campaign hoping to ensure our country's long-term survival in these major multi-sport Games.\n\nIf the foundation can't raise $800,000 over the next four years, then Canada's long history with the Games could be over.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games were launched in Hamilton, Ont., in 1930 as the British Empire Games, and in the modern era bring together top-flight athletes from more than 70 countries and territories who share a common language and heritage. The level of competition at these Games, which showcases the core summer sports like athletics, aquatics, gymnastics, cycling, and wrestling, is second only to the Olympics.\n\n[IMAGE[\n\nBut at the latest edition of the Games this past summer in Gold Coast, Australia, a sizeable portion of the Canadian team that competed was forced to, at least partially, pay its own freight.\n\nNearly half of the 282 athletes wearing the Maple Leaf in Australia bought their own tickets in order to get there. And now in light of drastic government funding cuts to Commonwealth Games Canada, the team slated to take part in Birmingham, England in 2022 may be the last.\n\n\"The practice of athletes having to pay to represent Canada in international competition began in the depression era but the Canadian economy is thriving today,\" says Dr. Bruce Kidd of the University of Toronto.\n\nKidd won Commonwealth Games gold in Perth, Australia in 1962 in the six-mile race and is also a Lou Marsh trophy winner as Canada's Athlete of the Year. He has written extensively on the power of sport and the Commonwealth Games vis-\u00e0-vis international development, inclusion, and gender equity.\n\nKidd believes the Commonwealth Games have been essential to creating a universal appeal for sport and that Canada, as the founding nation, needs to remain a vital part of the process.\n\n\"We should say as a matter of policy that all qualified athletes should have their way paid to those international competitions we value and I would like to think that includes the Commonwealth Games,\" Kidd stresses.\n\n\"As much as I would like to see more Games staged in the developing Commonwealth we should have another Games in Canada, ideally in 2030 if not before. Sadly, that will be needed to restore funding and respect for Commonwealth Games Canada.\"\n\nThe Commonwealth Games have been held four times in Canada, 1930 at Hamilton, 1954 in Vancouver where England's Roger Bannister and Australia's John Landy both ran sub-four minutes in what became known as \"The Miracle Mile.\" They were also hosted in 1978 in Edmonton, and most recently in 1994 in Victoria.\n\nThe countries embodied by the Commonwealth are racially diverse and represent a huge portion of the world's population. The Games have been undertaken in North America, Europe, Oceania, the Caribbean and Asia. They have also broken ground in less developed nations such as India, which staged the 2010 edition of the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.\n\nCanadian Sports Hall of Fame diver Alexandre Despatie is a nine-time gold medallist and has participated at four editions of the Games. He won championships at his last Commonwealth summit in India but arguably his most famous victory was the 10-metre platform gold he captured at the age of 13 while competing at the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n\"As an athlete with a rich history at the Commonwealth Games I simply do not understand that my fellow athletes from a country like Canada are in a position where they have to pay to compete,\" he says.\n\n\"I have competed in places where conditions are not comparable to Canada, to say the least. I have never heard of an athlete who is forced to pay in order to compete for their country. This makes no sense to me and I truly hope that we can find a solution to this.\"\n\nThe Commonwealth Games are also the first multi-sport Games to reach equal participation rates among men and women as well as attempt significant integration of Para or disabled sport into the competitive program.\n\n\"These Games from the beginning have made a commitment to inclusion,\" says Senator Chantal Petitclerc, a 14-time Paralympic champion who won Commonwealth gold in the 800-metre wheelchair race in Manchester, England in 2002, was the flag-bearer in Melbourne in 2006, and served as chef de mission for the Canadian team in Glasgow, Scotland in 2014.\n\n\"I competed at my first Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand, (1990), and will never forget being literally kicked off the track because the official believed the wheelchair would damage the track. Now the Commonwealth Games have become the most inclusive Games in terms of numbers of Para-sport athletes involved but also of gender equity. That is simply a good sport model to follow.\"\n\nThe chef de mission for Team Canada at the recent Gold Coast Commonwealth Games was Claire Carver-Dias a former synchronized swimmer and winner of two gold medals in Manchester in 2002.\n\nShe is understandably saddened and disappointed by the uncertain future of Canada's connection to the so-called, \"Friendly Games.\"\n\n\"These Games have been part of our sporting culture since 1930 and play an important part in our athletes' high performance journey,\" Carver-Dias notes.\n\n\"In these days of political uncertainty there is something to be said about the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of many nations, being held together by shared principles of governance and a commitment by all members to creating a peaceful, equal and prosperous world.\"\n\nIt is unsettling in times of increasing strife and global isolation that sport feels compelled to put its hand out on this Giving Tuesday.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games originated in Canada as part of a symbolic movement designed to build international togetherness and prosperity.\n\nThe prospect of our athletes and, ultimately our country, having the lasting bonds it forged with these historic and worthwhile Games severed for good is almost unthinkable.",

                    "body": "The bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see the women's team sport apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday said it has submitted its bid for the inclusion of T20 women's cricket into the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. The bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see the women's team sport apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nCricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur where South Africa stood on top of the podium. \"The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport,\" said the ICC in a statement. \"The ICC has the unanimous backing of its Members and Board of Directors to pursue the inclusion of women's cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games. An ICC and ECB delegation will present its bid for the inclusion of women's cricket in the Birmingham 2022 sporting programme to an assessment panel early next month,\" it added.\n\nThe bid to the Commonwealth Games Federation proposes an eight team T20 event played in two pools of four teams and totalling 16 matches in eight days held at two venues. ICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: \"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. \"23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket.\" ECB Chairman Colin Graves said women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games will be a big boost to the sport. \"The women's game is going from strength to strength, attracting strong crowds and drawing girls and boys to cricket it's an important strategic focus and a huge opportunity.\n\n\"To have cricket play a part in the Commonwealth Games, seen by a wide and diverse audience in the UK and played out across the world, would be a real boost for cricket and the women's game,\" he said. India women's captain Harmanpreet Kaur too welcomed the ICC bid. \"It's a great idea, and we'll get more fan following when we introduce cricket to Commonwealth Games. We can get more fans, we can get more games to improve our cricket. I'm really happy we're going to get more games to play,\" said Kaur.\n\nCatch up on all the latest T20 news and updates here.

                    "body": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday confirmed that it has submitted a bid for the inclusion of Twenty-20 women's cricket into the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2022.\n\nThe bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see one of the world's fastest growing women's team sports apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family, said a press release issued here. Cricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpa where South Africa stood on top of the podium. The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.\n\nICC Chief Executive David Richardson said Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 'This partnership has the potential to go way beyond a sporting event that can be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of fans in Birmingham, the UK and the rest of the world,' he said.\n\nECB Chairman Colin Graves said, 'The women's game is going from strength to strength, attracting strong crowds and drawing girls and boys to cricket.'\n\n'To have cricket play a part in the Commonwealth Games, seen by a wide and diverse audience in the UK and played out across the world, would be a real boost for cricket and the women's game,' he said. The bid to the Commonwealth Games Federation proposes an eight team T20 event played in two pools of four teams. -- APP",

                    "body": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday confirmed that it has submitted a bid for the inclusion of T20 women's cricket into the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2022.\n\nThe bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see one of the world's fastest growing women's team sports apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nCricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpa where South Africa stood on top of the podium. The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.\n\nICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: \"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth.\n\n\"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket. If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity.\"\n\nMoreover, he posited that this \"partnership has the potential to go way beyond a sporting event that can be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of fans in Birmingham, the UK and the rest of the world. I believe the players who reflect the diversity of this audience will send a powerful message to young women in Birmingham and beyond about the potential that they can achieve through sport.\"\n\nThe bid to the Commonwealth Games Federation proposes an eight team T20 event played in two pools of four teams and totaling 16 matches in eight days held at two venues.\n\nAccording to a release, the ICC said that it has the unanimous backing of its Members and Board of Directors to pursue the inclusion of women's cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\n\nAn ICC and ECB delegation will present its bid for the inclusion of women's cricket in the Birmingham 2022 sporting programme to an assessment panel early next month.",

Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organizations have to grow women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth.\n\n\"There's a saying that 'you can't be it if you can't see it' - imagine the impact of millions of young girls around the world watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage.\"\n\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games is set to take place in England and rightly so, the bid has been made in partnership with the England Cricket Board (ECB).\n\nIf the bid turns out to be successful, then it will be the second time that cricket will a be part of the Commonwealth Games. In 1998, cricket was part of the event where South Africa beat Australia in the gold medal match.",

An ICC and ECB delegation will present its bid for the inclusion of women's cricket in the Birmingham 2022 sporting programme to an assessment panel early next month,\" it added.\n\nThe bid to the Commonwealth Games Federation proposes an eight team T20 event played in two pools of four teams and totalling 16 matches in eight days held at two venues.\n\nICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: \"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage.\n\n\"23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket.\"\n\nECB Chairman Colin Graves said women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games will be a big boost to the sport.\n\n\"The women's game is going from strength to strength, attracting strong crowds and drawing girls and boys to cricket - it's an important strategic focus and a huge opportunity.\n\n\"To have cricket play a part in the Commonwealth Games, seen by a wide and diverse audience in the UK and played out across the world, would be a real boost for cricket and the women's game,\" he said.\n\nIndia women's captain Harmanpreet Kaur too welcomed the ICC bid.\n\n\"It's a great idea, and we'll get more fan following when we introduce cricket to Commonwealth Games. We can get more fans, we can get more games to improve our cricket. I'm really happy we're going to get more games to play,\" said Kaur.\n\n(With Agency inputs)",

                    "body": "For such a Commonwealth-centric sport, it has felt peculiar that cricket has largely been absent from the world's third largest multi-sports event. Quintessentially British, cricket's sole dip in the Commonwealth Games was two decade ago in Kuala Lumpur through the 50-over format.\n\nThe drought may soon be over with the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the England and Wales Cricket Board lodging a joint bid to have women's Twenty20 cricket feature at the 2022 Games in Birmingham.\n\n\"We would like cricket to lead the way in the Commonwealth in inspiring more young girls to take up sport regardless of their background or culture,\" ICC chief executive Dave Richardson said.\n\n\"Imagine the impact of millions of young girls around the world watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage.\"\n\nAccording to a report in The Guardian, the Commonwealth Games Federation is set to make the final decision, to be ratified by next September. Other sports seeking admission alongside women's cricket are archery, shooting, para-table tennis and volleyball.\n\nThere has been somewhat of a renewed push in recent years for cricket to be reinserted in the Commonwealth Games with the event seen as a stepping stone for eventual inclusion into the Olympics - possibly Los Angeles in 2028 - which Richardson has expressed support for. Cricket's sole Olympics appearance was at the 1900 Games in Paris.\n\nCuriously, men's cricket is not part of the Birmingham bid to reinforce the complexities the sport has had with multi-sports events. The sticking point for cricket continues to revolve around its increasingly congested calendar dotted by the plethora of Twenty20 leagues worldwide.\n\nThe Indian Premier League (IPL), which runs in April and May, clashed with the Commonwealth Games in the Gold Coast earlier this year. The men's talent would have been relatively barren if cricket had been part of the games in Gold Coast.\n\nAnother thorny issue has been the powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) overall reticence, a blow for any legitimate pursuit given the governing body's overwhelming might and wealth. The BCCI fears losing its autonomy to the country's Olympic committee.\n\nEver protective of its cash cow being the IPL, the most popular and richest T20 domestic league worldwide, the BCCI are also wary of competing T20 events.\n\nAfter 2021, the T20 World Cup will run every two years highlighting the lucrative tournament's ability to fill the coffers and further cramp cricket's schedule.\n\nAdding major multi-sports events would saturate the calendar with much rejigging required. Whether cricket chiefs would be willing to reduce the regularity of money spinners such as the T20 World Cup remains to be seen.\n\nRight now, that's all a long way off but a tentative first step is being made with the women's T20 bid for Birmingham. For so long, cricket has been confined to its British boundaries but the sport's leaders, especially the pragmatic Richardson, are striving to expose cricket to new audiences, especially in the lucrative markets of the U.S. and China.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Olympics, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games - the world's second biggest multi-sports event but cricket was axed for the recent games in Jakarta - are the ideal showpieces to attract fresh interest. Cricket has fallen behind other major sports soccer, basketball and rugby in efforts to globalize.\n\nFor those cricketers who did experience playing in Kuala Lumpur two decades ago, the lure of being part of major multi-sports events is obvious. \"Twenty20 cricket is the perfect format for the event and I think cricketers - and the fans - are missing something memorable with cricket not being part of the Commonwealth Games,\" Suresh Perera, who represented Sri Lanka at the event, tells me.\n\n\"The Commonwealth Games is definitely a highlight, something that will always be special for me. More exposure on the world stage can only be a good thing for cricket.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of a successful Women's World T20, current cricketers are excited about the possibility of playing at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.\n\n\"So much of what we do is about trying to get young girls and boys to pick up a bat and a ball and start playing the sport and the exposure of being in a global event like the Commonwealth Games would be so valuable for that,\" England women's captain Heather Knight said.",

                    "body": "Dubai, Nov 26 (IANS) Reiterating its commitment to globalising the game, the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday confirmed its submission of a bid for inclusion of womens T20 cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.\n\nMaking the announcement, ICC Chief Executive David Richardson highlighted the importance of \"creating a new partnership\" between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have towards growing women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth,\" Richardson said in a statement.\n\nRichardson also pointed out the importance of including the sport in Birmingham, which according to him, shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage.\n\n\"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 percent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket,\" he said.\n\n\"If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity.\n\n\"This partnership has the potential to go way beyond a sporting event that can be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of fans in Birmingham, the UK and the rest of the world. I believe the players who reflect the diversity of this audience will send a powerful message to young women in Birmingham and beyond about the potential that they can achieve through sport,\" he added.\n\nIf the ICC's submission is granted and women's cricket is included in the 2022 CWG, it will be a comeback for the sport after more than two decades.\n\nCricket made its CWG debut in 1998 in Malaysia, where South Africa finished on top of the podium. Australia and New Zealand bagged the silver and bronze medals respectively.",

The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.\n\nGet the latest ICC Test rankings here.\n\nICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: \"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth.\n\n\"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket. If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity.\n\n\"This partnership has the potential to go way beyond a sporting event that can be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of fans in Birmingham, the UK and the rest of the world. I believe the players who reflect the diversity of this audience will send a powerful message to young women in Birmingham and beyond about the potential that they can achieve through sport.\n\n\"We would like cricket to lead the way in the Commonwealth in inspiring more young girls to take up sport regardless of their background or culture. There's a saying that 'you can't be it if you can't see it' - imagine the impact of millions of young girls around the world watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage.'",

                    "body": "The bid proposes an eight-team event played in two pools of four teams and totalling 16 matches in eight days held at two venues\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday said it has submitted its bid for the inclusion of T20 women's cricket into the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.\n\nThe bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see the women's team sport apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nCricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with the men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur where South Africa stood on top of the podium.\n\n\"The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport,\" said the ICC in a statement.\n\n\"The ICC has the unanimous backing of its Members and Board of Directors to pursue the inclusion of women's cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games. An ICC and ECB delegation will present its bid for the inclusion of women's cricket in the Birmingham 2022 sporting programme to an assessment panel early next month,\" it added.\n\nThe bid to the Commonwealth Games Federation proposes an eight team T20 event played in two pools of four teams and totalling 16 matches in eight days held at two venues.\n\nICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: \"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket-playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket.\"\n\nECB Chairman Colin Graves said women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games will be a big boost to the sport.\n\n\"The women's game is going from strength to strength, attracting strong crowds and drawing girls and boys to cricket - it's an important strategic focus and a huge opportunity.\n\n\"To have cricket play a part in the Commonwealth Games, seen by a wide and diverse audience in the UK and played out across the world, would be a real boost for cricket and the women's game,\" he said.\n\nIndia women's captain Harmanpreet Kaur too welcomed the ICC bid.\n\n\"It's a great idea, and we'll get more fan following when we introduce cricket to the Commonwealth Games. We can get more fans, we can get more games to improve our cricket. I'm really happy we're going to get more games to play,\" said Kaur.",

According to Richardson, 23% of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK.\n\n\"...the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket,\" he said.\n\n\"If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity,\" he added.",

                    "body": "New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday submitted a bid for the inclusion of women's T20 cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.\n\nThe bid to the Commonwealth Games Federation proposes an eight-team T20 event to be played in two pools of four teams and totalling 16 matches in eight days to be held at two venues.\n\nAccording to ICC, the bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see one of the world's fastest growing women's team sports apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nThe sport had made only one appearance during the 1998 Commonwealth Games in the 50-over format.\n\nCurrently, Australia Women are the reigning World T20 champions after defeating England by eight wickets in the final over the 2018 edition in Antigua on Saturday night and will now host the 2020 version.\n\nECB Chairman Colin Graves said women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games will be a big boost to the sport.\n\nOn the other hand ICC chief executive, David Richardson said, Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries.",

                    "body": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) has submitted a bid for the inclusion of women's Twenty20 at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, the governing body said on Monday.\n\nCricket has not featured in the quadrennial Games since its maiden appearance in 1998 when the South African men's team won the gold medal in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\"Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing (the) women's sport...\"\n\nBirmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as 23 percent of its residents have links to cricket-playing nations outside the United Kingdom, Richardson said.\n\n\"If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity.\"\n\nCricket Australia (CA) were quick to support the bid two days after their women's team won the World Twenty20 crown in West Indies.\n\n\"It's exciting to think that cricket could potentially feature at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham,\" CA chief executive Kevin Roberts said in a statement.\n\n\"We are committed to cricket being a sport of choice for women and girls in Australia, and with the ICC T20 World Cup in our backyard in 2020.\n\n\"We know the popularity of the women's game will continue to rise in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nCricket, which has struggled to grow beyond its traditional bases, was last played at the Olympics in the 1900 Paris Games.\n\nThe ICC has been pushing for the game's Olympic return with the 20-over format, but the powerful Indian board has not been very keen on it.\n\nThey fear it might lose its autonomy and be answerable to the country's Olympic committee.

There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity.\"\n\nThe ICC has proposed an eight-team T20 event, with teams split into two groups and 16 matches to be played at two venues.\n\nThe 25,000-capacity Edgbaston is the obvious venue to host the major games.\n\nThe 1998 Games in Kuala Lumper featured 16 teams, including smaller nations like Canada, Malaysia and Northern Ireland, that were split into four groups.\n\nIt's not known how the ICC proposes for Caribbean nations to participate in the event given athletes from the region represent their individual countries at the Games, while international cricketers play under the banner of the West Indies.\n\nIn Kuala Lumper, Jamaica, Barbados and Antigua and Barbuda all played in the cricket tournament, meaning Windies teammates like Curtly Ambrose (Antigua), Jimmy Adams (Jamaica) and Sherwin Campbell (Barbados) represented competing teams.\n\n\"We fully support the ICC'S bid to have Women's T20I cricket included in this event,\" Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts said in a statement.\n\n\"(We) know if it was to happen, it would be a great outcome for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, and the future of cricket for women, men, girls and boys worldwide.\n\nOur women's team are great ambassadors for the game and our country, inspiring the next generation of girls and boys in Australia to chase their sporting dreams.\"",

                    "body": "Dubai, November 26: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday confirmed that they have submitted a bid for the inclusion of Twenty20 women's cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games slated to be held in Birmingham, England. The bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see one of the world's fastest growing women's team sports apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family. Reflecting on the same, ICC chief executive David Richardson said that cricket and commonwealth are perfectly aligned as 910 million cricket fans are from Commonwealth countries.\n\nHe further stated that Birmingham is a perfect place to launch this \"partnership\" as the city \"shares a rich and diverse culture and heritage.\" \"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to grow women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness, and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth,\" Richardson said. \"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket,\" he added. The chief executive also expressed belief that including women's cricket in Commonwealth Games would provide a much-needed inspiration for young girls to take up the sport regardless of their background or culture. Mithali Raj Surpasses Virat Kohli, Martin Guptill and Babar Azam After Scoring 17th Half-Century During India vs Ireland, ICC T20 Women's Cricket World Cup 2018.\n\n\"We would like cricket to lead the way in the Commonwealth in inspiring more young girls to take up sport regardless of their background or culture. There's a saying that 'you can't be it if you can't see it' - imagine the impact of millions of young girls around the world watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked why the same effort is not being made with regards to men's cricket, Richardson said that despite a lot of developments in women's cricket over the last few years, cricket for girls is not considered as a mainstream sport in many of their member countries. \"Women's cricket has come on in leaps and bound over the last few years but still in many of our member countries, it is not regarded as a mainstream sport for women and girls. Women's event in commonwealth games will allow us to certainly change that,\" he said.\n\n\"If we want to be ambitious about women's cricket then we need to make bold decisions. Women's event in Commonwealth Games will be one of those decisions that we would look back and say that it was a game changer for women's game. Amongst the men, cricket is popular in those countries. Women's cricket has got a little bit to make up,\" he added. Cricket has made just one appearance at the Commonwealth Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur where South Africa stood on top of the podium.\n\nThe application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.",

                    "body": "Reflecting on the same, ICC chief executive David Richardson said that cricket and commonwealth are perfectly aligned as 910 million cricket fans are from Commonwealth countries.\n\nHe further stated that Birmingham is a perfect place to launch this \"partnership\" as the city \"shares a rich and diverse culture and heritage.\"\n\n\"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to grow women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness, and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth,\" Richardson said.\n\n\"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket,\" he added.\n\nThe chief executive also expressed belief that including women's cricket in Commonwealth Games would provide a much-needed inspiration for young girls to take up the sport regardless of their background or culture.\n\n\"We would like cricket to lead the way in the Commonwealth in inspiring more young girls to take up sport regardless of their background or culture. There's a saying that 'you can't be it if you can't see it' - imagine the impact of millions of young girls around the world watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked why the same effort is not being made with regards to men's cricket, Richardson said that despite a lot of developments in women's cricket over the last few years, cricket for girls is not considered as a mainstream sport in many of their member countries.\n\n\"Women's cricket has come on in leaps and bound over the last few years but still in many of our member countries, it is not regarded as a mainstream sport for women and girls. Women's event in commonwealth games will allow us to certainly change that,\" he said.\n\n\"If we want to be ambitious about women's cricket then we need to make bold decisions. Women's event in Commonwealth Games will be one of those decisions that we would look back and say that it was a game changer for women's game. Amongst the men, cricket is popular in those countries. Women's cricket has got a little bit to make up,\" he added.\n\nCricket has made just one appearance at the Commonwealth Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur where South Africa stood on top of the podium.\n\nThe application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "Cricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur where South Africa stood on top of the podium.\n\n\"The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport,\" said the ICC in a statement.\n\nICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: \"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage.\n\n\"23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket.\"\n\nECB Chairman Colin Graves said women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games will be a big boost to the sport.\n\n\"The women's game is going from strength to strength, attracting strong crowds and drawing girls and boys to cricket it's an important strategic focus and a huge opportunity.\n\n\"To have cricket play a part in the Commonwealth Games, seen by a wide and diverse audience in the UK and played out across the world, would be a real boost for cricket and the women's game,\" he said.\n\nIndia women's captain Harmanpreet Kaur too welcomed the ICC bid.\n\n\"It's a great idea, and we'll get more fan following when we introduce cricket to Commonwealth Games. We can get more fans, we can get more games to improve our cricket. I'm really happy we're going to get more games to play,\" said Kaur.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

                    "body": "A day after the Women's World T20 2018 concluded in the Caribbean with Australia beating England in the final, ICC confirmed it had submitted a bid for women's T20 cricket to be included in the 2022 Commonwealth Games that will take place in Birmingham, England.\n\nICC chief executive David Richardson said the move would bring in several new fans and inspire more women to take up cricket. \"We would like cricket to lead the way in the Commonwealth in inspiring more young girls to take up sport regardless of their background or culture,\" Richardson said. \"Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth.\n\n\"There's a saying that 'you can't be it if you can't see it' - imagine the impact of millions of young girls around the world watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage.\"\n\nThe bid has been made in partnership with the ECB, and the possibility of cricket being part of the Commonwealth Games was welcomed by leading women cricketers.\n\nEngland captain Heather Knight felt there were many positives to the move. \"It would mean a lot. There's always prestige around something like that,\" Knight said. \"The women's game has gone from strength to strength, and this would be another platform to show that.\"\n\nAustralia captain Meg Lanning thought would have an added benefit too. \"To have cricket in there would be amazing,\" Lanning said. \"It shows how far the game is coming It would give us another really big tournament to look forward to. The opportunity to win a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games would be great as an athlete.\"\n\nIf the bid is successful, it would mark the second time that cricket has been part of the Commonwealth Games. The men had competed at 1998 event, with South Africa beating Australia in the gold medal match.\n\nA report in The Guardian said there would be a presentation to the organising committee, and the Commonwealth Games Federation would then make the final decision, to be ratified by September 2019, while also elaborating on the process and the issue with West Indies, which is made up of several countries and cannot thus compete as 'West Indies'.\n\n\"According to the submission, Edgbaston would be the primary venue for the eight-team competition, with county grounds at Worcester, Derbyshire and Leicester under consideration to serve as the secondary host during the group stages,\" the report said. \"The top-eight ranked T20 sides would be granted qualification. The complication, as it was in 1998, is West Indies, who represent several nations. It is understood they would be asked to nominate one country from the region to take part as an imperfect solution to the problem.\n\n\"The paperwork submitted the Friday before last will be augmented with a series of visual presentations next Monday and Tuesday to Birmingham 2022 decision-makers. Mindful of how important this will be, the ICC will be represented by David Richardson, their chief executive. The board of the organisation has already given the bid its full support.\"",

There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity,\" he added.\n\nCricket Australia (CA) were quick to support the bid two days after their women's team won the World Twenty20 crown in West Indies.\n\n\"It's exciting to think that cricket could potentially feature at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham,\" CA chief executive Kevin Roberts said in a statement.\n\n\"We are committed to cricket being a sport of choice for women and girls in Australia, and with the ICC T20 World Cup in our backyard in 2020, we know the popularity of the women's game will continue to rise in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nCricket, which has struggled to grow beyond its traditional bases, was last played at the Olympics in the 1900 Paris Games.\n\nThe ICC has been pushing for the game's Olympic return with the 20-over format but the powerful Indian board has not been very keen on it, fearing it might lose its autonomy and be answerable to the country's Olympic committee.\n\n(Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Ian Ransom)",

There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity'\n\nIMAGE: 'Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport'. Photograph: ICC/Twitter\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) has submitted a bid for the inclusion of women's Twenty20 in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, the governing body said on Monday.\n\nCricket has not featured in the quadrennial Games since its maiden appearance in 1998 when the South African men's team won the gold medal in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries,\" ICC chief executive David Richardson said in a statement.\n\n\"Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport...\"\n\nBirmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as 23 percent of its residents have links to cricket-playing nations outside the United Kingdom, Richardson said.\n\n\"If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity,\" he added.\n\nCricket Australia (CA) were quick to support the bid two days after their women's team won the World Twenty20 crown in West Indies.\n\n\"It's exciting to think that cricket could potentially feature at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham,\" CA chief executive Kevin Roberts said in a statement.\n\n\"We are committed to cricket being a sport of choice for women and girls in Australia, and with the ICC T20 World Cup in our backyard in 2020, we know the popularity of the women's game will continue to rise in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nCricket, which has struggled to grow beyond its traditional bases, was last played at the Olympics in the 1900 Paris Games.\n\nThe ICC has been pushing for the game's Olympic return with the 20-over format but the powerful Indian board has not been very keen on it, fearing it might lose its autonomy and be answerable to the country's Olympic committee.",

                    "body": "Dubai, Nov 26 (PTI) The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday said it has submitted its bid for the inclusion of T20 women's cricket into the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.\n\nThe bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see the women's team sport apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nCricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur where South Africa stood on top of the podium.\n\n\"The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport,\" said the ICC in a statement.\n\n\"The ICC has the unanimous backing of its Members and Board of Directors to pursue the inclusion of women's cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games. An ICC and ECB delegation will present its bid for the inclusion of women's cricket in the Birmingham 2022 sporting programme to an assessment panel early next month,\" it added.\n\nThe bid to the Commonwealth Games Federation proposes an eight team T20 event played in two pools of four teams and totalling 16 matches in eight days held at two venues.\n\nICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: \"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage.\n\n\"23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket.\"\n\nECB Chairman Colin Graves said women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games will be a big boost to the sport.\n\n\"The women's game is going from strength to strength, attracting strong crowds and drawing girls and boys to cricket - it's an important strategic focus and a huge opportunity.\n\n\"To have cricket play a part in the Commonwealth Games, seen by a wide and diverse audience in the UK and played out across the world, would be a real boost for cricket and the women's game,\" he said.\n\nIndia women's captain Harmanpreet Kaur too welcomed the ICC bid.\n\n\"It's a great idea, and we'll get more fan following when we introduce cricket to Commonwealth Games. We can get more fans, we can get more games to improve our cricket. I'm really happy we're going to get more games to play,\" said Kaur. PTI",

Subsequent attempts to have the sport reintroduced have failed.\n\nCricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts said his governing body backed the push to have the women's T20 format included.",

                    "body": "Cricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpa where South Africa stood on top of the podium.\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) today confirmed it has submitted a bid for the inclusion of T20 women's cricket into the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2022. The bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see one of the world's fastest growing women's team sports apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nCricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpa where South Africa stood on top of the podium. The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.\n\nICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: \"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth.\n\n\"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket. If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity.\n\n\"This partnership has the potential to go way beyond a sporting event that can be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of fans in Birmingham, the UK and the rest of the world. I believe the players who reflect the diversity of this audience will send a powerful message to young women in Birmingham and beyond about the potential that they can achieve through sport.\n\n\"We would like cricket to lead the way in the Commonwealth in inspiring more young girls to take up sport regardless of their background or culture. There's a saying that 'you can't be it if you can't see it' - imagine the impact of millions of young girls around the world watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage.'",

                    "body": "ICC confirmed on Monday (November 26) its submission of a bid for the inclusion of Women's T20 cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. While announcing the decision, ICC chief executive David Richardson spoke of 'creating a new partnership' between women's cricket and the Commonwealth games. The decision comes at a time when women's cricket is on the ascendancy in terms of quality, reach and interest.\n\n\"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth,\" ICC Chief Executive David Richardson.\n\n\"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket. If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity.\n\n\"This partnership has the potential to go way beyond a sporting event that can be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of fans in Birmingham, the UK and the rest of the world. I believe the players who reflect the diversity of this audience will send a powerful message to young women in Birmingham and beyond about the potential that they can achieve through sport.\"\n\nThe only previous instance of cricket being part of the commonwealth games was in 1998 in Malaysia, when South Africa finished on top of the podium while Australia and New Zealand bagged the silver and bronze medals respectively.",

                    "body": "DUBAI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has submitted a bid for the inclusion of women's Twenty20 in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, the governing body said on Monday.\n\nCricket has not featured in the quadrennial Games since its maiden appearance in 1998 when the South African men's team won the gold medal in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries,\" ICC chief executive David Richardson said in a statement.\n\n\"Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport...\"\n\nBirmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as 23 percent of its residents have links to cricket-playing nations outside the United Kingdom, Richardson said.\n\n\"If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity,\" he added.\n\nCricket Australia (CA) were quick to support the bid two days after their women's team won the World Twenty20 crown in West Indies.\n\n\"It's exciting to think that cricket could potentially feature at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham,\" CA chief executive Kevin Roberts said in a statement.\n\n\"We are committed to cricket being a sport of choice for women and girls in Australia, and with the ICC T20 World Cup in our backyard in 2020, we know the popularity of the women's game will continue to rise in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nCricket, which has struggled to grow beyond its traditional bases, was last played at the Olympics in the 1900 Paris Games.\n\nThe ICC has been pushing for the game's Olympic return with the 20-over format but the powerful Indian board has not been very keen on it, fearing it might lose its autonomy and be answerable to the country's Olympic committee.\n\n(Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Ian Ransom)",

                    "body": "Dubai [UAE], Nov 26 (ANI): The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday confirmed that they have submitted a bid for the inclusion of Twenty20 women's cricket in the 2022 Commonwealth Games slated to be held in Birmingham, England.\n\nThe bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see one of the world's fastest growing women's team sports apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nReflecting on the same, ICC chief executive David Richardson said that cricket and commonwealth are perfectly aligned as 910 million cricket fans are from Commonwealth countries.\n\nHe further stated that Birmingham is a perfect place to launch this \"partnership\" as the city \"shares a rich and diverse culture and heritage.\"\n\n\"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to grow women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness, and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth,\" Richardson said.\n\n\"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket,\" he added.\n\nThe chief executive also expressed belief that including women's cricket in Commonwealth Games would provide a much-needed inspiration for young girls to take up the sport regardless of their background or culture.\n\n\"We would like cricket to lead the way in the Commonwealth in inspiring more young girls to take up sport regardless of their background or culture. There's a saying that 'you can't be it if you can't see it' - imagine the impact of millions of young girls around the world watching women's cricket in the Commonwealth Games and being empowered with the knowledge that they too can play cricket, represent their country and compete on a global stage,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked why the same effort is not being made with regards to men's cricket, Richardson said that despite a lot of developments in women's cricket over the last few years, cricket for girls is not considered as a mainstream sport in many of their member countries.\n\n\"Women's cricket has come on in leaps and bound over the last few years but still in many of our member countries, it is not regarded as a mainstream sport for women and girls. Women's event in commonwealth games will allow us to certainly change that,\" he said.\n\n\"If we want to be ambitious about women's cricket then we need to make bold decisions. Women's event in Commonwealth Games will be one of those decisions that we would look back and say that it was a game changer for women's game. Amongst the men, cricket is popular in those countries. Women's cricket has got a little bit to make up,\" he added.\n\nCricket has made just one appearance at the Commonwealth Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur where South Africa stood on top of the podium.\n\nThe application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.

According to ICC, \"The bid has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see one of the world's fastest growing women's team sports apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nThe sport had earlier made only one appearance at the Games back in 1998. The matches during the 1998 Commonwealth Games were played in the 50-over format and had List A status.\n\n\"The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport,\" ICC said in the statement.\n\nICC CEO David Richardson said that cricket and Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans.\n\n\"Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth,\" Richardson added.\n\nSouth Africa men's team stood on top of the podium during the 1998 Commonwealth Games while Australia and New Zealand finished second and third respectively.",

                    "body": "Cape Town - The International Cricket Council (ICC) has submitted a bid for the inclusion of T20 women's cricket into the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2022.\n\nThe bid, which has been made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), will see one of the world's fastest growing women's team sports apply to become part of the Commonwealth Games family.\n\nCricket has made just one appearance at the Games previously, with men playing in 1998 in Kuala Lumpur where South Africa stood on top of the podium. The application for inclusion of women's cricket for Birmingham 2022 is part of the global strategy for cricket to inspire and empower women and girls around the world and to drive greater levels of inclusivity and opportunity throughout the sport.\n\n\"Cricket and the Commonwealth are inextricably linked and almost perfectly aligned with 910 million of cricket's one billion plus adult fans from Commonwealth countries. Creating a new partnership between women's cricket and the Commonwealth Games demonstrates the commitment both organisations have to growing women's sport and delivering greater equality, fairness and opportunity in sport across the Commonwealth,\" ICC Chief Executive David Richardson said.\n\n\"Birmingham is the perfect place to launch this partnership as the city shares cricket's rich and diverse culture and heritage. 23 per cent of the city's residents have links to cricket playing nations outside the UK, the deep connection between cricket and Birmingham will bring people together and inspire future generations of players and fans of women's cricket. If cricket were to be staged in these Games, we know every team competing would be guaranteed 'home' support. There's a ready-made audience and ready-made infrastructure in the local vicinity.\"",

The crowds came out in thousands to watch and the tournament displayed the love people in this part of the world have for the game.\n\n\"We saw some memorable performances and milestones being achieved and I would like to thank all the teams for putting up their best and showing the world what women's cricket is all about. The ICC is committed to backing both women's cricket and the T20 format and this tournament has played a significant part in that,\" Mr Richardson said.\n\n\"This tournament has been watched around the world and I'm sure the quality of cricket displayed during the tournament will inspire girls across continents to pick up a bat or a ball and play cricket,\" he added.\n\nMr. Richardson, who watched Saturday's final between Australia and England at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, also acknowledged the sponsors for the event.\n\n\"The ICC would also like to thank the sponsors for their backing of the event as well as Star, our global broadcast partner which plays such a significant role in growing the women's game and taking coverage of this event to more than 200 territories around the world.\n\n\"Finally I'd like to thank the ground staff for handling every challenge that came up during the tournament. It would not have been possible to put up such a wonderful tournament without their support.\"",

                    "body": "There was a buzz of excitement in the air for athletes, coaches and volunteers -- and for me -- when the 2018 Commonwealth Games started with spectacular opening ceremonies in Gold Coast, Australia. But despite the glitzy ceremony, the shine of the Commonwealth Games appears to have dulled.\n\nThere is declining media coverage for these Games, while a cultural shift has lead many to question the merit of the Commonwealth.\n\nConsidering the waning interest, why do the Commonwealth Games still exist?\n\nThe Commonwealth is rooted in its historical past of sovereign and independent states that formally made up the British Empire and its traditional trade relations between member states.\n\nWhat sets the Commonwealth apart from other assembled nations is that all members share a commitment to democracy, humanity and equality. Unlike the United Nations, all countries have an equal voice, no matter their size.\n\nThis ensures even a small country like Nauru, with a population of just 10,000, has a voice as equal as India's, with a population of more than 1.2 billion.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games celebrates this commonality every four years. In fact, the Commonwealth Sport Movement is an extension of the Games. Through the power of sports, there is continuous engagement with communities in between the Games years, embracing and celebrating diversity while promoting sport for development. Evolving with the times, the modern Commonwealth vision is \"building peaceful, sustainable and prosperous communities globally, by inspiring Commonwealth Athletes to drive the impact and ambition of all Commonwealth Citizens through sport.\"\n\nA recent study exploring positive sports diplomacy found the Commonwealth Games effectively foster co-operation and friendship among member nations and territories, successfully achieving its objective.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games have a long history that dates back as far as 1891, five years before the birth of the modern Olympic Games. An English minister, Rev. Astley Cooper, proposed that a Pan-Britannic-Pan-Anglican Contest and Festival should occur every four years as a means of \"increasing the goodwill and good understanding of the British Empire.\"\n\nHowever, it would take three decades before this notion was realized. In 1930, Melville Marks (Bobby) Robinson, a Canadian sports editor and official in athletics, championed the first Games which took place in Hamilton, Ontario, with 400 athletes from 11 countries participating. Known as the British Empire Games at the time, this event also introduced various hosting concepts including the first Athletes Village, awards podium, volunteerism and media press box.\n\nEach time Canada has hosted the Commonwealth Games has been a game-changer to the Commonwealth movement.\n\nThe 1954 Empire Games in Vancouver featured one of the first live televised sporting events in Canada -- the iconic Miracle Mile. Three months after England's Roger Bannister became the first person to run the mile under four minutes, he faced off against John Landy from Australia, who had since bettered Bannister's time. Bannister won the showdown in what is still considered one of the greatest races of all time.\n\nAnother game-changing moment was the renaming of the British Empire Games to the \"Commonwealth Games\" at the 1978 Games in Edmonton. And in 1994, the Commonwealth Games in Victoria, B.C., was the first time able-bodied and para athletes competed in the same Games.\n\nDespite the central role Canada has played in the Commonwealth Games, there appears to be a lack of knowledge, awareness and value of these Games.\n\nPerhaps the declining media exposure over the years may be partly to blame. In the past, CBC provided full coverage. This year, the only way Canadians will be able to see the events live will be if they sign up for DAZN, a subscription-based live streaming platform -- CBC will only show highlights.\n\nThe symbiotic relationships of sport and media offers sport a promotional platform. To illustrate this point, a moment that will forever stay with me was watching Donovan Bailey, Glenroy Gilbert, Carlton Chambers and Bruny Surin win gold in the men's 4\u00d7100 metres at the 1994 Victoria Commonwealth Games. I had just begun training in the high jump and found myself glued to the television, paying particular attention to athletics.\n\nAs I watched the men's relay team take their victory lap with the Canadian flag, I was deeply inspired. In that moment, I decided I too wanted to represent Canada at the Commonwealth Games and perhaps even the Olympic Games. I had no reason to believe I would ever be good enough to be a national team athlete, but it ignited a desire in me.\n\nTo my surprise, four years later I was representing Canada at the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia - my first of four Commonwealth Games. Eventually, I too would take a victory lap around the track waving proudly the Canadian flag when I won the gold medal at the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games.\n\nLack of media coverage of a sporting event is like a tree falling in the forest. If no one is around to hear the tree fall, does it make a sound? Likewise, if coverage of a mega sporting event like the Commonwealth Games is not freely accessible and wide-reaching, can the Games be said to exist or even be important?\n\nThe Commonwealth Games include athletes from 71 nations and territories, estimated to be approximately one third of the world's population.\n\nThe 2018 Gold Coast Games will be the most inclusive international Games in history. These Games will be the first international Games to achieve gender equality, with the same number of medal events for women and men; the first international Games to have a reconciliation action plan, respecting and celebrating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures; and the largest integrated para-sport program in Commonwealth Games history.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games also play an integral role in an athlete's pursuit of excellence. Certainly, I attribute my ability of being ranked in the Top 10 in my sport and becoming an Olympian because of the Commonwealth Games. The depth of competition is high, and winning a medal at these Games can signify for an athlete they have arrived, and are among the best in the world at their sport.\n\nMost importantly, this can go a long way in enhancing the confidence of an athlete -- the cornerstone behind any great performance. In fact, 53 per cent of Canadian athletes who competed at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games were on the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. And of the 22 medals won at the Rio Games, 14 of them came from athletes who competed at the 2014 Glasgow Games.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games serve as a gateway to podium performances at the Olympic Games. Athletes are able to assess how they are they are progressing midway through the quadrennial cycle while also comparing how they measure up to their competitors while taking part in a mega sporting event.\n\nFor many Canadian athletes competing in Gold Coast, these Games are a direct pathway for 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. For non-Olympic sports, these Games may be the pinnacle event in their sporting career. The Commonwealth Games are not to be taken lightly.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games are to Canada what the Olympic Games are to Greece. They exist because Canada created them. The Games continues to exist because they are driven by shared values, offering excellence both on and off the field of play. For those reasons and more, the Commonwealth Games are still important.",

                    "body": "Women's T20 cricket is strongly in the running to be admitted as a new sport to the schedule at the Commonwealth Games at Birmingham in 2022.\n\nA joint bid between the International Cricket Council and England and Wales Cricket Board was submitted last week before a vital presentation to the organising committee of the event next Monday. If an endorsement is won at that stage, the Commonwealth Games Federation will then make the final decision, to be ratified by September next year.\n\nAccording to the submission, Edgbaston would be the primary venue for the eight-team competition with county grounds at Worcester, Derbyshire and Leicester under consideration to serve as the secondary host during the group stages.\n\nThat each of the games would be broadcast live on BBC television has been described as \"an absolute game-changer\" by Clare Connor, the director of England Women's Cricket. She has been steering the process from an ECB perspective in collaboration with an ICC working group led by Ian Higgins, the governing body's chief operating officer.\n\n\"One of the things we have noticed is the more we have worked on this the more passionate and committed people have become,\" Connor told The Guardian.\n\n\"People really tune into Olympic and Commonwealth Games watching sports they normally wouldn't watch and are inspired by them. So it would be a different audience from a typical cricket tournament. So the benefits for women's cricket are very obvious.\"\n\nThe sport stood a strong chance of admission for the original host city for 2022, Durban. When the shift to Birmingham was decided upon at the start of 2018, the formal process started again. Sports that are seeking admission alongside women's cricket are archery, shooting, para-table tennis and volleyball but they will not be competing for a fixed number of spots - the organising committee can give the green light to any contender that meets its criteria.\n\nCricket has once before featured in the Commonwealth Games, at Kuala Lumpur in 1998. Then, it was a men's 50-over competition only with South Africa beating Australia in the gold medal match. As Connor explains, one strength of the current pitch is that it is a women's competition, as only 40% of Commonwealth Games athletes are currently female.\n\n\"I hope our bid will be strong because it fits with what the Commonwealth Games are looking to do around equality,\" she said. \"One of their three core values is equality and they are, like most organisations or sports in a healthy place, looking to create more opportunities for female athletes and this would mean eight teams of female athletes. It is also really powerful that women's cricket could be in on its own, standing there in its own right.\"\n\nThe top-eight ranked T20 sides would be granted qualification. The complication, as it was in 1998, is West Indies who represent several nations. It is understood they would be asked to nominate one country from the region to take part as an imperfect solution to the problem.\n\nThe paperwork submitted the Friday before last will be augmented with a series of visual presentations next Monday and Tuesday to Birmingham 2022 decision-makers. Mindful of how important this will be, the ICC will be represented by David Richardson, their chief executive. The board of the organisation has already given the bid its full support.\n\n\"We have submitted a really strong case,\" Connor said. \"We are a sport with such an amazing heritage but are also looking to be modern and be dynamic and inclusive too, just as the Commonwealth are. We are a sport that is constantly proving itself and growing in audience, fans and media engagement. So for all those reasons, I am confident. We have a chance to stand in front of them next week and really bring this to life.\"",
