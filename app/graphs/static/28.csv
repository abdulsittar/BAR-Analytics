This document helps synthesize data across a variety of fields to track trends in AI innovation, investment, regulation, and social impacts.

This year's report documents AI's astonishing progress on tasks such as image classification and language understanding, where it has surpassed human capabilities. In other areas, such as advanced mathematics and visual commonsense reasoning and planning, humans maintain an edge. It seems it's only a matter of time before it catches up to humans on these skills.

In terms of research and development, the Index reveals the continuing dominance of industry over academia as the principal source of AI investment and innovation. Despite a marked increase in collaboration between these two sectors, industry -- to be precise, a handful of the largest companies -- are leading the way. A similar pattern of dominance plays out between countries: the US is by far the leader in AI R&D. American companies in the US have invested over $67 billion in AI; by contrast, companies in China, the next-largest investor, have put down less than $8 billion. Innovation has tracked investment: the US eclipses all other countries, with 61 ""notable"" machine learning models compared to 15 for China, the runner-up.

AI's broader societal impacts is another major theme. The Index notes a growing awareness and concern among the global population regarding AI's impacts on daily life. Globally, 52 percent express unease toward AI, a 13-percentage-point increase from 2022. Moreover, 57 percent of workers across the globe think that AI will change how they do their job within the next five years, and a full 36 percent think that AI will replace their job during this timeframe. Increased public awareness of AI's potential has coincided with a sharp increase in AI-related regulations in the US.

Research on AI's impacts on work, however, may alleviate some workers' concerns. Several studies from this past year suggest that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output, supporting the idea of AI as an ""augmentation"" to human skills rather than a ""substitute"" for it. These studies also demonstrate AI's potential to accelerate and democratize skills with the largest benefits flowing to lower-skilled workers.

The amount of energy around AI-related policy questions continues to grow with increasing emphasis on trying to understand the ""when"" and ""how"" this new technology will make itself felt in the labor and skill requirements of an AI-infused economy. For the time being, however, it's good to know America remains the undefeated champion of innovation in the market-making technology of our lifetimes.","[{'uri': 'julia_cataneo@aei.org', 'name': 'Julia Cataneo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Artificial intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Research and development'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Commonsense reasoning'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Computer vision'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Mathematics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Stanford University'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Eclipse'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Academy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Machine learning'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}]",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Orrell.AEIdeas.041924.jpg,eng-9486604,0.349019608,451245929,1,aei.org,news,American Enterprise Institute - AEI,Artificial intelligence Research and development Commonsense reasoning Computer vision Mathematics Stanford University China Eclipse Academy Machine learning United States,aei.org,440,NLP,2024,4,19,5,18,2024-04-19

This detailed yearly report presents a data-based overview of AI's progress across significant areas, including research, ethics, policy, public perception, and economics. A few highlights from the report are below.

AI Beats Humans on Some Tasks, but Not on All.

AI has achieved levels of performance that match or exceed human capabilities in certain tasks, including image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. It still lags behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning, and planning. However, the most important trend is the incredible pace of improvement. Many of today's limitations are likely to be addressed in the very near future.

The U.S. Is Leading with Models

The United States leads the world with 61 notable machine learning models, thanks to its strong AI research infrastructure, significant R&D investment, and major tech companies and research institutions. These models excel in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, often setting new performance standards and frequently being open-sourced, enabling global innovation.

Foundation models, like GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3, represent a groundbreaking AI class, trained on vast, diverse datasets enabling them to acquire a broad understanding of language, reasoning, and problem-solving. Their adaptability allows them to be fine-tuned for specific tasks with minimal training, enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. In 2023, the U.S. solidified its lead with 109 models, far outpacing China's 20.

The High Costs of Training

The report emphasizes the staggering increase in the computational resources and financial investment required to train the latest AI models. To put this into perspective, the original Transformer model, introduced in 2017 and forming the basis for nearly all modern LLMs, cost approximately $900 to train. In 2023, leading foundation models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini Ultra incurred estimated training costs of $78 million and $191 million, respectively.

To put the required computational power into perspective, the original Transformer needed about 7,400 petaFLOPs (a measure of computational power) to train. In contrast, Google's Gemini Ultra required an astonishing 50 billion petaFLOPs - nearly 6,800 times more computational power than its predecessor from just six years earlier.

Training advanced models requires significant computing power and financial resources, limiting development to a few well-funded companies. An exception is Meta's Llama 3, introduced after the HAI report. Despite its impressive benchmark performances, rivaling closed models like OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo, Meta has open-sourced Llama 3. By absorbing the high training costs, Meta enables developers to leverage these cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) for innovative applications and services.

AI Impact on Workers

Recent studies provide evidence of AI's impact on productivity across sectors. A Microsoft meta-review found workers using AI productivity tools completed tasks 26-73 percent faster. A Harvard study showed consultants with GPT-4 access experienced a 12.2 percent productivity increase, 25.1 percent speed boost, and 40 percent quality improvement on selected tasks compared to those without AI. And finally, a NBER study revealed call center agents using AI handled 14.2 percent more calls per hour. These findings suggest the growing integration of AI into the economy over the past five years has the potential to boost productivity significantly. My AEI colleagues Brent Orrell and David Veldran have a deeper dive into the workforce issues with AI in this recently released paper.

AI Driving New Breakthroughs in Science and Medicine

One chapter was dedicated entirely to some of the ways AI is introducing breakthroughs in science and medicine, including GNoME for materials discovery and GraphCast for improved weather forecasting. In medicine, AI systems like SynthSR transformed brain scans for advanced analysis, while AlphaMissence assisted in mutation classification. The FDA also approved an increasing number of AI-related medical devices, with the total rising by more than 45-fold since 2012.

While it is commonly believed that LLMs require extensive fine-tuning on domain-specific data to excel in specialized fields like medicine, a 2023 study from Microsoft challenges this assumption. By employing prompt engineering techniques, Medprompt became the first model to surpass 90 percent accuracy on the MedQA benchmark. This suggests the potential of prompt engineering as an effective alternative to fine-tuning, demonstrating that LLMs can be adapted to specialized domains without the need for extensive training on domain-specific data.

The Steady Increase of US Regulations

In 2023, the Executive Office of the President and the Commerce Department led AI regulation, each issuing five AI-related rules. The Department of Health and Human Services followed with four. The number of agencies involved in AI regulation increased from 17 in 2022 to 21 in 2023, a trend likely to accelerate following the Biden Administration's Executive Order and OMB directives encouraging regulatory agencies to explore AI governance in their sectors.","[{'uri': 'owen_o_brien_powers@aei.org', 'name': ""Owen O'Brien-Powers"", 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri':
