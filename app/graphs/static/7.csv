His claims have rattled leaders across the country.

Pakistan's Interior Minister, Ahsan Iqbal, has strongly rejected the criticism, insisting Pakistan is a global leader in the fight against terrorism.

""No country in the world has done more than Pakistan to end terrorism, nor committed so many sacrifices for it. Therefore, we reject any assertions that accuse Pakistan of harbouring terrorists, because we are the biggest victims of terrorism. Also, no other country in the world can claim to have achieved the successes that Pakistan has achieved in the war against terrorism in the past four years.""

President Trump said Pakistan has been providing ""safe haven to terrorist organisations.""

His words have angered many in Pakistan, who want the country to end its joint counter-terrorism effort with the US.

Sami-ul Haq runs an Islamic seminary where many senior Afghan Taliban have studied.

He describes the US President's comments as an ""open declaration of war against Pakistan's sovereignty and integrity.""

""The government of Pakistan should quit the alliance for war against so-called terrorism, and policies should be devised keeping in view the needs of national security.""

US-Pakistan relations have been strained over the past decade, escalating in 2011, when al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by US special forces in Pakistan.

Fresh tensions emerged last year, when a US drone strike killed the Afghan Taliban leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, in southwestern Pakistan.

Pakistan's government labelled the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and denied knowing that the Mullah was in the country, as it did with Osama bin Laden.

Sami ul-Haq wants Pakistan to take a more hard-line stance against the US, just as North Korea and Iran have.

""We have to give America a decisive answer. We will have to display courage and honour. We should take a lesson from North Korea, which has lived through tough times but has beaten the hell out of America. America is bowing before North Korea daily. We should also learn a lesson from Iran. Whatever they are, they are determined. Heavens will not fall if America gets annoyed with us. In fact all our troubles will come to an end.""

Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal has taken a softer tone, assuring Pakistan will continue its efforts to fight terror.

But he says blaming his country for the unrest in Afghanistan is not the way to achieve peace.

""We believe that countries in this region have to come together to bring peace to Afghanistan, because terrorists are not the enemies of Pakistan or any other country only. They are the enemies of everyone. We cannot put an end to terrorism by pointing fingers at one another. In order to defeat terrorism, we need to forge unity, we need cooperation. And for this purpose Pakistan will continue to play its role internationally, as well as locally.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Madrasa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Declaration of war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Osama bin Laden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereignty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'North Korea'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'North Korea'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhtar_Mansour', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Akhtar Mansour'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_special_operations_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States special operations forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullah', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Mullah'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Unmanned aerial vehicle'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'National security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}}}]",http://www.sbs.com.au/news/sites/sbs.com.au.news/files/styles/full/public/images/podcast/2017-08/site_197_World%2520News_737435.JPG?itok=_U8-ubXg,eng-3382459,-0.5294117647058824,241236360,1,sbs.com.au,news,SBS,Terrorism United States Pakistan Donald Trump Madrasa Declaration of war Government of Pakistan War on Terror Taliban Counter-terrorism Osama bin Laden Sovereignty North Korea Afghanistan Akhtar Mansour United States special operations forces Mullah Unmanned aerial vehicle National security Al-Qaeda Iran,Australia,AU,,,,,C4,C2,Australia,AU,Christian,15.0,20.0,20.0,11.0,6.0,22.0,24.0,28.0,23.0,15.0,21.0,7.0,19.0,38.0,90.0,61.0,51.0,21.0,71.0,,,,,Pacific Islands Forum (PIF),PIF,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,6,2,2017-08-24

NATO aircraft are said to be flying once again out of the air base that was home to most of the Australian forces during the Afghanistan war, the longest this country has ever fought.

Even before US President Donald Trump's speech heralding a tougher stance in the country, the perilous situation facing Tarin Kowt, the provincial capital in Oruzgan where the Australian Defence Force was based, and where most of the 41 Australian fallen died, has forced an intervention by coalition air power, according to local aid worker Turyallai Sahim.

The 26-year-old says there is fighting every night within three or four kilometres of the city - a description consistent with Afghan media reports. And in the past week, NATO aircraft have been providing close air support to the Afghan National Army as they battle encroaching Taliban fighters, he said.

A NATO spokesman, Captain Jan Dunmurray, said coalition forces were providing ""advise and assist"" help to Afghan troops in Oruzgan but added ""we cannot discuss further details of current operations"". NATO carried out air strikes around Tarin Kowt last September when the Taliban came close to taking the city.

Sahim says Oruzgan people had been better off when international forces were there, when there were construction projects, support for schools, jobs and - most importantly - security.

""But now there are no projects implemented by the government. The schools are almost done. There is no pressure and support for schools from the government. The security is getting worse. Oruzgan people are even expecting that soon the whole province will come into the hands of the Taliban because the government is very weak.""

Trump this week announced that the US-led coalition will have yet another crack at finding some tolerable end state for Afghanistan after 16 years. It didn't amount to a new strategy in the eyes of most informed watchers. The strategy remains to beat the Taliban down until the more moderate among them negotiate for peace, leaving a smaller hard core - alongside al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates - who can be dealt with as an ongoing but militarily manageable threat. The end state is an Afghanistan that does not present an unacceptable national security risk to the US and its allies.

Rather, the key to Trump's speech was the message that the US-led coalition is there to stay - and it will keep killing Taliban and other insurgents as long as they keep fighting the government. The muscle that backed up the message was Trump's vow to give his military commanders the freedom and resources to do what is required.

Trump deliberately did not give numbers though US media reports consistently say the president has authorised about another 4000 American troops. Trump said he expected comparable commitments from other coalition countries.

Australia will likely be asked to make a further contribution. But if a request comes, it is expected to be limited and not something that will overstretch the Australian Defence Force. Any return to combat is regarded as unlikely.

What is Trump's plan?

Trump's approach has been broadly welcomed by analysts in the US and Australia, though most assessments say only that it is an improvement on the current state, in that it might yield a bearable outcome. The rationale for this modest optimism rests fairly heavily on the military component. Trump said that the US would use all of its power - diplomatic, economic and military - and his top diplomat Rex Tillerson followed that up with promises of ""much more rigorous efforts"" on combating corruption in Afghanistan.

But those sentiments were secondary. As Secretary of State Tillerson himself summed it up: ""This entire effort is intended to put pressure on the Taliban to have the Taliban understand: you will not win a battlefield victory. We may not win one, but neither will you.""

The immediate question is how the coalition will deny the Taliban this victory with a force that, even after troop increases, will be a fraction of the 130,000-strong foreign forces there in 2010. The government of President Ashraf Ghani now controls barely half the country by area; it generally holds major population centres whereas the insurgents' strength is in the rural areas. IS has set up in Afghanistan and al-Qaeda still has a presence.

The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, is preparing a military plan. Experts and insiders say the coalition increase will likely be a combination of special operations to kill or capture insurgent leaders and advise the Afghans, various so-called ""enablers"" such as intelligence, logistics and air medical evacuation, and more close air support from fighters, drones and helicopter gunships.

Trump also indicated he would free up his commanders to make quick decisions with changed rules of engagement or ROEs. A former senior US official who has served as the chief of defence intelligence at the US Embassy in Canberra and worked closely with US National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster in Afghanistan says this will be welcomed by the Pentagon.

""Operations in the theatre have been ham-strung because the previous administration had stringent ROEs for different target sets,"" he says. ""Now, be it [IS] or al-Qaeda or the Taliban or the Haqqani [militant network] the ROE will be the same. It makes command and control much simpler and much easier for the soldiers on the point.""

What will Australia's role be?

There will also be more training of the Afghan forces, and that is where the ADF is most likely to see a boost in numbers. Any increase would be the result of a conversation with the US, rather than a straight request from Washington. There are other countries - namely those in NATO - Trump clearly had in mind when he called for more help, but Australia is also well regarded and therefore attractive to coalition planners.

US Defence Secretary James Mattis and new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly - both former Marine generals - have long and close relationships with the Australian military. They won't ask for things they know the Turnbull government can't agree to.

Chief of the Australian Defence Force Mark Binskin sent a strong signal that Australia is already pulling its weight in the broad fight against Islamist terrorism around the world.

He tells Fairfax Media that the previously announced increase of 30 extra trainers, taking the Australian total to 300, was ""entirely consistent with President Trump's call for the international community to deploy more troops to Afghanistan"".

He says it is important for Australia to remain in Afghanistan but added that ""we do not consider Afghanistan in isolation"" - suggesting Australia's efforts needed to be balanced against what it was doing elsewhere in the world. ""Terrorism is a global issue and our counter-terrorism strategies are always considered in this context.""

He says the ADF has 800 people fighting IS and was flying P-3 Orion spy planes in support of Philippines forces in Mindanao, where an IS-affiliated insurgency is poised to establish an enduring splinter ""caliphate"" that could become a base for South-east Asia.

Can the Taliban be beaten?

The model of training local forces while also advising them from relatively close to the front line and providing air strikes has worked well in Iraq. There may be some useful lessons from the fight against Islamic State - a point Tillerson made this week - but experts cautioned that while Iraq had relatively well-defined military goals of retaking cities such as Mosul, the Taliban rarely fights like a conventional military that would allow the coalition and Afghans to concentrate their forces and achieve major victories.

""It's not just a little different, it's very different,"" says Michael Crane, a retired major-general who commanded Australian forces in the Middle East including Afghanistan in 2007 and again in 2013. ""Afghanistan is a very difficult problem. You have remote mountain areas, border problems, corruption, no real sense of nation. And the Taliban is a very determined enemy.""

Crane envisions the US forces directly pursuing IS and al-Qaeda while leaving the Taliban largely to the Afghans, though with support. It will take a long time and will depend on considerable US patience.

Rodger Shanahan, a former Army officer now with the Lowy Institute, says ""nation building"" wouldn't exactly be abandoned as Trump had vowed, but it would not be based on values. That message - switching nation-building for ""killing terrorists"" - played well on Fox News. But it also was directed clearly at Taliban leaders, Shanahan says.

""The strategic message to the Taliban is that there is no end state. And some of you guys can come on board. If you can guarantee us that people who are going to harm America don't have freedom of action in Afghanistan, you can implement your view of Afghan society to some degree.

""It's the only way to get them to the negotiating table - raise the cost to them by military action and reduce the moral high ground on which you sat. Is it a morally good thing? Probably not. Does it mean you can perhaps set an achievable goal? It's more likely under this direction than previously.""

How realistic it is to negotiate with the Taliban is a matter of debate. William Maley, a leading Afghanistan expert at the Australian National University, branded any peace deal with the Taliban as ""a pipe dream"" because the group's extremism was fundamentally irreconcilable with any acceptable vision of Afghanistan.

They have to be defeated, he says. Most Afghans hate the Taliban. People in a country of seemingly endless war back the side they think will win, and therefore decisive military victories underscoring resolve on the part of the coalition and the Afghan government could drive the Taliban into irrelevance.

Is it a 'losing battle'?

Trump's other major pitch was that he would finally stop Pakistan allowing the Taliban to cross into sanctuaries in its territory to regroup. In fact the US has been trying to do this since 2001 - it's just that Trump issued his threats very publicly.

However cutting off military aid and removing Pakistan's status as a favoured non-NATO partner - much less bringing arch-rival India further into the equation as Trump threatened to do - could sever that relationship and create another enemy. And while nobody wants Afghanistan with its population of 33 million people to become a haven for terrorists, Pakistan is a country of more than 200 million people with its own Islamist forces and a nuclear arsenal.

Pushing Pakistan away for the sake of Afghanistan doesn't make much sense, some insiders point out. The Pakistan part, if Trump follows through, is a high-stakes gamble, but some think it could pay off.

""Washington is signalling to Pakistan there's a new administration in town and the commander-in-chief is half-crazy so when we make these kinds of threats, don't think it's empty rhetoric,"" Shanahan says.

Everyone Fairfax spoke to, both inside and outside the Australian government and officialdom, feel Trump's approach is an improvement on the present state of affairs. No one in authority in this country has been prepared to say what Tillerson said bluntly this week: that this has been a ""losing battle"".

Chris May, who served two tours of Afghanistan, fractured his neck and suffered post-traumatic stress disorder when the Bushmaster armoured vehicle he was commanding hit a roadside bomb about 40 kilometres north of Tarin Kowt in 2011.

Like many Australian veterans of Afghanistan, he feels the coalition drew down its forces too early. Trump's new approach isn't ""so much a step forward as a step sideways"", he says.

He talks about the progress they made while they were there: building girls' schools, trade centres, a water treatment plant, roads and bridges so that farmers could get their produce to Tarin Kowt - which had been a ""thriving metropolis"".

It's a reminder that Trump's ""principled realism"" comes at a considerable price when measured against the ambitions we once had for the country.

NATO aircraft are said to be flying once again out of the air base that was home to most of the Australian forces during the Afghanistan war, the longest this country has ever fought.

Even before US President Donald Trump's speech heralding a tougher stance in the country, the perilous situation facing Tarin Kowt, the provincial capital in Oruzgan where the Australian Defence Force was based, and where most of the 41 Australian fallen died, has forced an intervention by coalition air power, according to local aid worker Turyallai Sahim.

The 26-year-old says there is fighting every night within three or four kilometres of the city - a description consistent with Afghan media reports. And in the past week, NATO aircraft have been providing close air support to the Afghan National Army as they battle encroaching Taliban fighters, he said.

A NATO spokesman, Captain Jan Dunmurray, said coalition forces were providing ""advise and assist"" help to Afghan troops in Oruzgan but added ""we cannot discuss further details of current operations"". NATO carried out air strikes around Tarin Kowt last September when the Taliban came close to taking the city.

Sahim says Oruzgan people had been better off when international forces were there, when there were construction projects, support for schools, jobs and - most importantly - security.

""But now there are no projects implemented by the government. The schools are almost done. There is no pressure and support for schools from the government. The security is getting worse. Oruzgan people are even expecting that soon the whole province will come into the hands of the Taliban because the government is very weak.""

Trump this week announced that the US-led coalition will have yet another crack at finding some tolerable end state for Afghanistan after 16 years. It didn't amount to a new strategy in the eyes of most informed watchers. The strategy remains to beat the Taliban down until the more moderate among them negotiate for peace, leaving a smaller hard core - alongside al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates - who can be dealt with as an ongoing but militarily manageable threat. The end state is an Afghanistan that does not present an unacceptable national security risk to the US and its allies.

Rather, the key to Trump's speech was the message that the US-led coalition is there to stay - and it will keep killing Taliban and other insurgents as long as they keep fighting the government. The muscle that backed up the message was Trump's vow to give his military commanders the freedom and resources to do what is required.

Trump deliberately did not give numbers though US media reports consistently say the president has authorised about another 4000 American troops. Trump said he expected comparable commitments from other coalition countries.

Australia will likely be asked to make a further contribution. But if a request comes, it is expected to be limited and not something that will overstretch the Australian Defence Force. Any return to combat is regarded as unlikely.

What is Trump's plan?

Trump's approach has been broadly welcomed by analysts in the US and Australia, though most assessments say only that it is an improvement on the current state, in that it might yield a bearable outcome. The rationale for this modest optimism rests fairly heavily on the military component. Trump said that the US would use all of its power - diplomatic, economic and military - and his top diplomat Rex Tillerson followed that up with promises of ""much more rigorous efforts"" on combating corruption in Afghanistan.

But those sentiments were secondary. As Secretary of State Tillerson himself summed it up: ""This entire effort is intended to put pressure on the Taliban to have the Taliban understand: you will not win a battlefield victory. We may not win one, but neither will you.""

The immediate question is how the coalition will deny the Taliban this victory with a force that, even after troop increases, will be a fraction of the 130,000-strong foreign forces there in 2010. The government of President Ashraf Ghani now controls barely half the country by area; it generally holds major population centres whereas the insurgents' strength is in the rural areas. IS has set up in Afghanistan and al-Qaeda still has a presence.

The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, is preparing a military plan. Experts and insiders say the coalition increase will likely be a combination of special operations to kill or capture insurgent leaders and advise the Afghans, various so-called ""enablers"" such as intelligence, logistics and air medical evacuation, and more close air support from fighters, drones and helicopter gunships.

Trump also indicated he would free up his commanders to make quick decisions with changed rules of engagement or ROEs. A former senior US official who has served as the chief of defence intelligence at the US Embassy in Canberra and worked closely with US National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster in Afghanistan says this will be welcomed by the Pentagon.

""Operations in the theatre have been ham-strung because the previous administration had stringent ROEs for different target sets,"" he says. ""Now, be it [IS] or al-Qaeda or the Taliban or the Haqqani [militant network] the ROE will be the same. It makes command and control much simpler and much easier for the soldiers on the point.""

What will Australia's role be?

There will also be more training of the Afghan forces, and that is where the ADF is most likely to see a boost in numbers. Any increase would be the result of a conversation with the US, rather than a straight request from Washington. There are other countries - namely those in NATO - Trump clearly had in mind when he called for more help, but Australia is also well regarded and therefore attractive to coalition planners.

US Defence Secretary James Mattis and new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly - both former Marine generals - have long and close relationships with the Australian military. They won't ask for things they know the Turnbull government can't agree to.

Chief of the Australian Defence Force Mark Binskin sent a strong signal that Australia is already pulling its weight in the broad fight against Islamist terrorism around the world.

He tells Fairfax Media that the previously announced increase of 30 extra trainers, taking the Australian total to 300, was ""entirely consistent with President Trump's call for the international community to deploy more troops to Afghanistan"".

He says it is important for Australia to remain in Afghanistan but added that ""we do not consider Afghanistan in isolation"" - suggesting Australia's efforts needed to be balanced against what it was doing elsewhere in the world. ""Terrorism is a global issue and our counter-terrorism strategies are always considered in this context.""

He says the ADF has 800 people fighting IS and was flying P-3 Orion spy planes in support of Philippines forces in Mindanao, where an IS-affiliated insurgency is poised to establish an enduring splinter ""caliphate"" that could become a base for South-east Asia.

Can the Taliban be beaten?

The model of training local forces while also advising them from relatively close to the front line and providing air strikes has worked well in Iraq. There may be some useful lessons from the fight against Islamic State - a point Tillerson made this week - but experts cautioned that while Iraq had relatively well-defined military goals of retaking cities such as Mosul, the Taliban rarely fights like a conventional military that would allow the coalition and Afghans to concentrate their forces and achieve major victories.

""It's not just a little different, it's very different,"" says Michael Crane, a retired major-general who commanded Australian forces in the Middle East including Afghanistan in 2007 and again in 2013. ""Afghanistan is a very difficult problem. You have remote mountain areas, border problems, corruption, no real sense of nation. And the Taliban is a very determined enemy.""

Crane envisions the US forces directly pursuing IS and al-Qaeda while leaving the Taliban largely to the Afghans, though with support. It will take a long time and will depend on considerable US patience.

Rodger Shanahan, a former Army officer now with the Lowy Institute, says ""nation building"" wouldn't exactly be abandoned as Trump had vowed, but it would not be based on values. That message - switching nation-building for ""killing terrorists"" - played well on Fox News. But it also was directed clearly at Taliban leaders, Shanahan says.

""The strategic message to the Taliban is that there is no end state. And some of you guys can come on board. If you can guarantee us that people who are going to harm America don't have freedom of action in Afghanistan, you can implement your view of Afghan society to some degree.

""It's the only way to get them to the negotiating table - raise the cost to them by military action and reduce the moral high ground on which you sat. Is it a morally good thing? Probably not. Does it mean you can perhaps set an achievable goal? It's more likely under this direction than previously.""

How realistic it is to negotiate with the Taliban is a matter of debate. William Maley, a leading Afghanistan expert at the Australian National University, branded any peace deal with the Taliban as ""a pipe dream"" because the group's extremism was fundamentally irreconcilable with any acceptable vision of Afghanistan.

They have to be defeated, he says. Most Afghans hate the Taliban. People in a country of seemingly endless war back the side they think will win, and therefore decisive military victories underscoring resolve on the part of the coalition and the Afghan government could drive the Taliban into irrelevance.

Is it a 'losing battle'?

Trump's other major pitch was that he would finally stop Pakistan allowing the Taliban to cross into sanctuaries in its territory to regroup. In fact the US has been trying to do this since 2001 - it's just that Trump issued his threats very publicly.

However cutting off military aid and removing Pakistan's status as a favoured non-NATO partner - much less bringing arch-rival India further into the equation as Trump threatened to do - could sever that relationship and create another enemy. And while nobody wants Afghanistan with its population of 33 million people to become a haven for terrorists, Pakistan is a country of more than 200 million people with its own Islamist forces and a nuclear arsenal.

Pushing Pakistan away for the sake of Afghanistan doesn't make much sense, some insiders point out. The Pakistan part, if Trump follows through, is a high-stakes gamble, but some think it could pay off.

""Washington is signalling to Pakistan there's a new administration in town and the commander-in-chief is half-crazy so when we make these kinds of threats, don't think it's empty rhetoric,"" Shanahan says.

Everyone Fairfax spoke to, both inside and outside the Australian government and officialdom, feel Trump's approach is an improvement on the present state of affairs. No one in authority in this country has been prepared to say what Tillerson said bluntly this week: that this has been a ""losing battle"".

Chris May, who served two tours of Afghanistan, fractured his neck and suffered post-traumatic stress disorder when the Bushmaster armoured vehicle he was commanding hit a roadside bomb about 40 kilometres north of Tarin Kowt in 2011.

Like many Australian veterans of Afghanistan, he feels the coalition drew down its forces too early. Trump's new approach isn't ""so much a step forward as a step sideways"", he says.

He talks about the progress they made while they were there: building girls' schools, trade centres, a water treatment plant, roads and bridges so that farmers could get their produce to Tarin Kowt - which had been a ""thriving metropolis"".

It's a reminder that Trump's ""principled realism"" comes at a considerable price when measured against the ambitions we once had for the country.

""It's not just a little different, it's very different,"" says Michael Crane, a retired major-general who commanded Australian forces in the Middle East including Afghanistan in 2007 and again in 2013. ""Afghanistan is a very difficult problem. You have remote mountain areas, border problems, corruption, no real sense of nation. And the Taliban is a very determined enemy.""

Crane envisions the US forces directly pursuing IS and al-Qaeda while leaving the Taliban largely to the Afghans, though with support. It will take a long time and will depend on considerable US patience.

Rodger Shanahan, a former Army officer now with the Lowy Institute, says ""nation building"" wouldn't exactly be abandoned as Trump had vowed, but it would not be based on values. That message - switching nation-building for ""killing terrorists"" - played well on Fox News. But it also was directed clearly at Taliban leaders, Shanahan says.

""The strategic message to the Taliban is that there is no end state. And some of you guys can come on board. If you can guarantee us that people who are going to harm America don't have freedom of action in Afghanistan, you can implement your view of Afghan society to some degree.

""It's the only way to get them to the negotiating table - raise the cost to them by military action and reduce the moral high ground on which you sat. Is it a morally good thing? Probably not. Does it mean you can perhaps set an achievable goal? It's more likely under this direction than previously.""

How realistic it is to negotiate with the Taliban is a matter of debate. William Maley, a leading Afghanistan expert at the Australian National University, branded any peace deal with the Taliban as ""a pipe dream"" because the group's extremism was fundamentally irreconcilable with any acceptable vision of Afghanistan.

They have to be defeated, he says. Most Afghans hate the Taliban. People in a country of seemingly endless war back the side they think will win, and therefore decisive military victories underscoring resolve on the part of the coalition and the Afghan government could drive the Taliban into irrelevance.

Is it a 'losing battle'?

Trump's other major pitch was that he would finally stop Pakistan allowing the Taliban to cross into sanctuaries in its territory to regroup. In fact the US has been trying to do this since 2001 - it's just that Trump issued his threats very publicly.

However cutting off military aid and removing Pakistan's status as a favoured non-NATO partner - much less bringing arch-rival India further into the equation as Trump threatened to do - could sever that relationship and create another enemy. And while nobody wants Afghanistan with its population of 33 million people to become a haven for terrorists, Pakistan is a country of more than 200 million people with its own Islamist forces and a nuclear arsenal.

Pushing Pakistan away for the sake of Afghanistan doesn't make much sense, some insiders point out. The Pakistan part, if Trump follows through, is a high-stakes gamble, but some think it could pay off.

""Washington is signalling to Pakistan there's a new administration in town and the commander-in-chief is half-crazy so when we make these kinds of threats, don't think it's empty rhetoric,"" Shanahan says.

Everyone Fairfax spoke to, both inside and outside the Australian government and officialdom, feel Trump's approach is an improvement on the present state of affairs. No one in authority in this country has been prepared to say what Tillerson said bluntly this week: that this has been a ""losing battle"".

Chris May, who served two tours of Afghanistan, fractured his neck and suffered post-traumatic stress disorder when the Bushmaster armoured vehicle he was commanding hit a roadside bomb about 40 kilometres north of Tarin Kowt in 2011.

Like many Australian veterans of Afghanistan, he feels the coalition drew down its forces too early. Trump's new approach isn't ""so much a step forward as a step sideways"", he says.

He talks about the progress they made while they were there: building girls' schools, trade centres, a water treatment plant, roads and bridges so that farmers could get their produce to Tarin Kowt - which had been a ""thriving metropolis"".

It's a reminder that Trump's ""principled realism"" comes at a considerable price when measured against the ambitions we once had for the country.","[{'uri': 'david_wroe@watoday.com.au', 'name': 'David Wroe', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urozgan_Province', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Urozgan Province'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Urozgan Province'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian Defence Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coalition'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Joint_Task_Force_–_Operation_Inherent_Resolve', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarinkot', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Tarinkot'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Tarinkot'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_air_support', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Close air support'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Media', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Fairfax Media'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_warfare', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Aerial warfare'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._McMaster', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'H.

The Pentagon is likely to deploy about 4000 more US troops to Afghanistan in the coming months. In recent months, the US has intensified its air war in Afghanistan. During June, the US carried out 389 airstrikes in Afghanistan -- the highest monthly total in five years.

Award-winning journalist Azmat Khan, who has reported extensively from Afghanistan, told Democracy Now!: ""[Trump] repeated a refrain we have heard time and again about both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ... this idea that because the US withdrew hastily, in his view, that the Taliban was able to gain power [in Afghanistan], that ISIS was able to gain power [in Iraq].

""Right now the Taliban controls or retains significant influence in 40 percent of the country. But, to attribute that to a hasty withdrawal [doesn't] actually added up. So, if you think back to Obama's troop surge, back in 2010 to Afghanistan, specifically, what was often said was that putting troops in Iraq rather than Afghanistan was the reason why the Taliban was able to take power. So, they committed more than 100,000 troops to the country.

""And you're essentially hearing the exact same argument you heard then -- 'We can't withdraw too hastily.' You're seeing the exact same arguments being made again.

""And so, the question now is, what's different? What's different is this time there's no timetable for withdrawal.

""What President Trump justified as not wanting to broadcast what America's intentions are.""

Khan said one difference with the US's current approach was what ""seems to be a perceived shift in the approach towards Pakistan"". He said Trump's South Asia adviser, Lisa Curtis from the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank, has advocated continuously for a shift in the approach to Pakistan.

Khan pointed out that Curtis has previously advocated extending airstrikes in Pakistan, hitting new areas.

He added: ""There really is no advocacy for a political settlement. Given the fact that if you look at this history, this surge of troops has not yielded the result that it was -- that was anticipated back when the surge happened in 2010. In fact, the Taliban is stronger today than back then.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Now!', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Democracy Now!'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Iraq War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Pentagon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Iraq'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iraq'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'The Heritage Foundation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Think tank'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Right-wing politics'}}]",https://www.greenleft.org.au/sites/default/files/p19%20us%20afghanistan.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.07450980392156858,241409400,1,greenleft.org.au,news,Green Left,Donald Trump Afghanistan Democracy Now!

US President Donald Trump last week outlined a plan to combat the resurgence of the Taliban and said he would call on allies to do more.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said Australia will consider the merits of any request to boost its contribution beyond the 300 military training and support staff now in Afghanistan.

Labor Defence spokesman Richard Marles noted on Sunday Australia was the largest non-NATO contributor to efforts to strengthen the Afghan government and military.

""I firmly believe that we need to be playing our part in Afghanistan and that needs to be commensurate with our size and our capabilities and our ability to do what we can,"" he told ABC TV.

""I think it's also important to note that what we're doing now is much more sustainable - if I can put it that way - than perhaps has been the case in the past.""

The number of Australian troops in Afghanistan peaked at almost 1600 in mid-2009.

Reports suggest the US will boost its 8400-strong forces in Afghanistan by 4000, but Mr Trump did not confirm this when announcing the new plan.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian Labor Party'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Malcolm Turnbull'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Marles', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Richard Marles'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian Broadcasting Corporation'}}]",,eng-3382459,0.3019607843137255,241492560,1,sbs.com.au,news,SBS,Australian Labor Party Afghanistan Malcolm Turnbull Donald Trump Taliban Australia Richard Marles Politics of Afghanistan Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Australia,AU,,,,,C4,C2,Australia,AU,Christian,15.0,20.0,20.0,11.0,6.0,22.0,24.0,28.0,23.0,15.0,21.0,7.0,19.0,38.0,90.0,61.0,51.0,21.0,71.0,,,,,Pacific Islands Forum (PIF),PIF,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,27,16,1,2017-08-27
