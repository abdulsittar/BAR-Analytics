The former Indian captain smacked a classy 186, his first Test century since November 2019, guiding the hosts towards 571 on Sunday, while Axar Patel provided support with a belligerent 79.

Meanwhile, Nathan Lyon finished with 3-151 from 65 overs, setting a new personal best for most deliveries bowled in a Test innings. Young tweaker Todd Murphy also contributed three wickets, including the prized scalps of Kohli.

Both sides are sweating on fitness concerns -- Indian batter Shreyas Iyer was sent for scans on his back, while Australian opener Usman Khawaja jarred his knee while attempting a catch in the outfield.

Australia was 0-3 at stumps, still trailing India by 88 runs, with Travis Head and nightwatchman Matthew Kuhnemann unbeaten overnight.

It took him a while, but Virat Kohli has finally achieved his 28th Test century.

Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Indian superstar has been uncharacteristically ordinary in the five-day format, averaging 27.50 with the bat across 21 matches.

Before the Ahmedabad contest, his most recent Test century was way back in November 2019 -- a classy 136 against Bangladesh in Eden Gardens. After that knock, he didn't reach 80 in 42 Test innings.

But on a batting-friendly wicket at Narendra Modi Stadium, Kohli finally put to bed any speculation about his form.

Hundreds of phones were whipped out when Kohli reached 99, with fans eager to capture the moment their hero achieved his 75th international century. He passed the milestone with a trademark flick through mid-wicket, taking off his helmet and saluting the crowd before kissing his necklace and looking to the skies.

Kohli even converted to a daddy hundred, finishing on 186, his highest Test score against Australia, after nearly nine hours at the crease. According to Kohli's wife, Indian actress Anushka Sharma, the cricketer was battling illness throughout the marathon knock.

The 34-year-old needed 239 deliveries to reach triple figures, rarely attacking Australia's spinners or lofting over the infield. He was patient, never playing against the spin, instead waiting for the tweakers to stray onto his pads, with the leg glance being his most productive stroke.

The King is back, and hopefully, he's here to stay.

""The drought's over. The gates have opened,"" former Australian batter Mark Waugh said on Fox Cricket.

""You could tell right from the get-go he meant business. He played very few risky shots.

""He was so patient, just picked the bowling off.

""I don't think he's at his pure best at the moment, as far as his Test career is concerned ... but it just shows you his class.""

There wasn't much for Australia to celebrate on day four of the Ahmedabad Test, but Todd Murphy's performance was worthy of applause.

Despite the batter-friendly conditions in Ahmedabad, Murphy always looked like a threat with ball in hand, forcing India's top order to drop anchor and defend. Bad balls were a rarity, relentlessly peppering a good length while subtle variations in speed and seam position kept the batters on their toes.

Murphy's battle with Virat Kohli has been one of the highlights of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, and their arm wrestle continued on Sunday morning. The off-spinner bowled two consecutive maidens at the former Indian captain before dismissing Ravindra Jadeja at the other end.

Later that evening, Kohli eventually fell victim to Murphy for the fourth time in the series -- albeit after scoring 186.

The 22-year-old finished with figures of 3-113 from 45.5 overs, leaking just 2.47 runs per over. He was undeniably the pick of the Australian bowlers in Ahmedabad.

""He's bowled tidily, he's bowled with control,"" former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar said in commentary.

""He's hardly given anything away.""

Only 11 matches into his first-class career, Murphy continues to stake his claim as Lyon's heir apparent. If national selectors decided Australia needed two strike spinners in the Ashes squad this winter, Murphy is at the front of the queue.

""I haven't thought too far ahead but when you look ... when this series does come to an end it is going to slow down a little, it's quite rare other places in the world to play two spinners,"" Murphy told reporters on Tuesday.

""To have this taste so early, it will drive me to get better and what it even more when hopefully it next does come.""

Nathan Lyon and Matthew Kuhnemann stole the spotlight in Indore last week, with Murphy only contributing one wicket on the raging turner at Holkar Stadium. The spectacled tweaker was praised after the nine-wicket victory for bowling in partnerships, dying up one end and allowing his comrades to attack at the other.

""Obviously Nathan and Matt got all the wickets but ... his spell allowed everyone around him to take those wickets,"" Australia assistant coach Daniel Vettori told reporters earlier this week.

""Todd has that skill that he can be a defensive bowler and he can be an attacking bowler and work around pretty much whatever is required from him in the game. For such a young and inexperienced spinner ... to be able to come here and handle these tough situations and perform the role that's required has been impressive.""

Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja recklessly threw his wicket away on Sunday morning, dismissed in almost identical fashion to how Australian opener Travis Head departed on day one.

Having just smacked spinner Todd Murphy down the ground for a boundary, Jadeja attempted the same shot a couple of deliveries later, but the bat spun in his hand and flew towards mid-wicket, fortuitously landing between two fielders.

But the 34-year-old didn't learn his lesson, botching another lofted straight drive later in the same over, caught at mid-on by Usman Khawaja for 28.

Jadeja, who was 16 (54) not out overnight, had been immensely patient with the bat the previous evening, combining with Virat Kohli to safely guide the hosts to stumps.

The left-hander presumably had been instructed to pick up the tempo to hopefully force a result - if not, it's difficult to justify his shot selection.

""What has he done here?"" Indian commentator Harsha Bhogle said.

""Jadeja has played shots completely out of character, and he's given Australia a wicket on a platter.

Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar continued: ""What has happened? Did someone say anything to him that suddenly in this particular over, he's gone the aerial route?

""Look at that. What is this shot? Kohli's not impressed and the changeroom is not going to be impressed, I can tell you that. Rahul Dravid, the coach, is not going to be impressed with this shot.

""He's played such a responsible innings before this, therefore this is a shot hard to understand.""

India was still trailing by 171 runs when Jadeja departed, giving the Australians a sniff at clinching a first-innings lead. The hosts were also without Shreyas Iyer, who had been sent for scans on his back, meaning they had one less batter at their disposal.

However, Waugh was less critical of Jadeja's dismissal, praising him for trying to move the game forward.

""Murphy was bowling really full ... I don't mind that,"" Waugh said on Fox Cricket.

Ahmedabad cricket fans witnessed an old-fashioned grind at Narendra Modi Stadium this week, with both sides batting at a sluggish tempo in the first innings.

The Australians scored at a rate of 2.86 runs per over during their knock, with Usman Khawaja soaking up 422 deliveries at the crease on his way to 180.

India was even more defensive on day three -- during one particularly dull 16-over passage of play on Saturday afternoon, the hosts mustered just 22 runs.

The morning session of day four was just as forgettable, with Virat Kohli and Srikar Bharat looking to occupy the crease and grind Australia's bowlers into the dirt.

India's plan, to survive through to day five and ensure Australia had no chance of victory, was a stark contrast to what Brendon McCullum's England have been achieving over the past 12 months.

England takes risks, whether that be through brave declarations of aggressive batting, always ensuring the cricket is entertaining and all four results are possible regardless of the conditions.

The jury's out on which strategy is most effective, but the fourth Test between India and Australia is slowly approaching an anticlimax, while every England contest has been enthralling.

""It was tough to watch,"" Waugh said on Fox Cricket at lunch.

""They just want to bat and bat and bat. They want to bat until tomorrow morning ... that's the plan.

""They're solely focused on wiping off the deficit, then they might start to up the ante.

Former Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin continued: ""It was hard to watch.

""I understand what India are doing. They're taking Australia totally out of the game. They're taking the win off the table.""

Kohli was particularly defensive on Sunday morning, scoring 29 runs from 92 deliveries before the lunch break. Waugh attributed the 34-year-old's defensive mentality to his three-year century drought.

""That's all he's got on his mind, scoring a hundred,"" Waugh said.

""I'd like to see him be a bit more proactive and go over the top, but I can see what he's doing. He hasn't scored a Test century in more than three years ... he's just there to make a hundred.

""He just doesn't want to give the bowler any chance of dismissing him. The room for error is nil. He's just looking to defend and chip away. He's not looking to play any risky shots.

""If he was peeling off hundreds, he wouldn't be batting like this. He's batting like a man who hasn't scored a hundred for a long time. He's just grinding it out.""

Kohli thankfully picked up the pace after reaching triple figures -- his strike rate ballooned from 41.84 to 68.80 after celebrating his ton.

UNSUNG AUSSIE HERO HAS BEEN 'FAULTLESS'

Someone who perhaps hasn't received enough plaudits over the past 48 hours is Alex Carey, who has performed 1073 squats since Friday evening.

The Australian gloveman has been a rock behind the stumps throughout the series, rarely letting through sloppy byes or putting down regulation chances. He even kept up to the stumps while Cameron Green was sending down 135km/h rockets on day four, but the 31-year-old returned to his regulation position when a bouncer flew over his head for a boundary.

India is arguably the most challenging nation to don the gloves, and Carey has done a commendable job.

""Alex Carey has kept as well as any keeper in the last 20 years,"" Haddin said on Fox Cricket.

""He's been faultless. I think he's dropped one ball in this Test match.

""He's been absolutely outstanding.""

Carey's batting, however, has not been up to scratch over the past seven weeks -- the South Australian has averaged 9.33 in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, passing 10 just once in six knocks.

Perhaps it's time to chuck him back in the Karachi hotel pool?",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri':

After starting the day at 3-289, Virat Kohli went about pushing India past Australia's first-innings total of 480 and to a lead of 91. Kohli was the last batter out for 186, leaving Australia to survive six overs before stumps.

MAN OF THE MOMENT: Kohli ended a frustrating drought of more than three years to post his 28th Test century and eighth against Australia. It was nowhere near Kohli's best innings, but he battled his way back into form on a flat pitch.

KEY MOMENT: The colossal Narendra Modi Stadium might have only been at about one-sixth capacity but the crowd made it sound like it was full when Kohli reached his long-awaited century.

STAT OF THE DAY: India became just the third team in Test history to have their first six partnerships of an innings pass 50; Australia in the tied Test in Brisbane against the West Indies in 1960 and Pakistan against Bangladesh in 2015 are the others.

The Indian veteran's century in Ahmedabad, ending a 1205-year wait for his 28th Test ton dating back to November 2019, was the centrepiece as the hosts recorded a mammoth 571, and gives them an outside chance of a 3-1 series win over Australia with one day left for the series.

That fate, however, will rest with the pitch, which has shown no signs of deteriorating throughout the Test and continues to punish bowlers as mercilessly as the first three surfaces of the series did to the batters.

With just 20 wickets falling across the first four days, India's 88-run first innings lead will count for nought unless the pitch begins to break up on the fifth day, though with Usman Khawaja sustaining a leg injury and unable to open the batting in the final six overs of the day - a task then given to nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann - Australia will be vulnerable should the Indian spinners conjure any hitherto unseen demons from the deck.

Kuhnemann would have to survive a pair of near misses before the day was out, an outside edge off Ravichandran Ashwin just eluding the gloves of KS Bharat and a short ball from Mohammed Shami very nearly steered to short leg in the final over of the day.

Managing just six wickets for the day, and only bowling India out thanks to Shreyas Iyer's unavailability after going for scans on a lower back issue, it was another afternoon of toil for the Australian attack in searing heat.

Nathan Lyon sent down 65 overs, the most he has ever bowled in a Test innings, and received some late reward for effort with the wickets of Bharat (44) and a slogging Ashwin (7).

Todd Murphy (3/113 off 45.5 overs) also bowled a marathon stint, while Kuhnemann (1/94 off 25) and Mitchell Starc (1/97 off 22) were forced to toil particularly hard. But with any pace off the deck continually treated with disdain by the hosts, Steve Smith found himself turning to spin on most occasions to limit the damage.

But it was a day on which batters needed to practically give their wicket away to fall, as Ravindra Jadeja did when, after crawling to 28 off 84 balls, attempted to loft Murphy down the ground but only succeeded in chipping him straight to Khawaja at mid-on.

Any hopes the wicket would expose India's middle order quickly evaporated as Bharat joined Kohli at the crease. The pair took India past lunch, then into the record books, the team becoming the first ever to start a Test innings with five consecutive 50-run partnerships.

Watchful at first but later explosive, taking 78 balls to reach 26 before smacking the expensive Green for consecutive sixes, the first over mid-wicket and the second to fine leg. Together with a fierce cut for four, the over would cost 21.

Bharat, though, was unable to convert the onslaught into a maiden Test half-century, an inside edge off Lyon pouched by Peter Handscomb at short leg.

With Axar Patel for company now, Kohli remained sedate; his century, compiled off 241 balls, reached with a trademark flick off his pads in front of square. The celebration was more relief than jubilation, as the biggest monkey in world cricket was at last removed from the veteran's back.

While Kohli resisted the temptation to raise his run rate as India closed in on Australia's first innings 480, Patel had no such reservations.

Showing once again the broad array of strokes that have brought him remarkable success with the bat (if not with the ball) thus far this series, the all-rounder took on the deep fielders frequently and pierced gaps when he wasn't.

One of the former, a lofted six over long-off, had an unintended extra benefit for India; a leaping Khawaja appeared to turn an ankle leaping to try and reel the ball in, soon departing the field with the injury serious enough to prevent him from opening the batting.

And still Kohli marched on. Only the loosest of balls were sent to the boundary, with attacking Patel's job; this was pure sadism from the veteran. Like Steve Smith, the Indian veteran is one who could and happily would bat for five days if required, with the thrill of getting to face the next ball almost equal to the thrill of dispatching it.

Kohli reached his 150 before finally beginning to accelerate; 39 runs were taken off the last seven overs before tea, bringing India a 39-run first innings lead. With Patel reaching his third half-century of the series, a final-session onslaught against an exhausted attack appeared on the cards.

And so it would prove: Patel would fall for 79 chopping on an attempted mow off Starc, but not before mowing Kuhnemann twice over mid-wicket.

Ashwin came in keen for a good time and not a long time, slog-sweeping Lyon to Kuhnemann in the deep for 7; but the focus now was on runs, not wickets.

As if to prove it, an ambitious second run from Kohli to retain the strike left Umesh Yadav high and dry, the tailender caught well short by a Handscomb direct hit from the deep - though in truth, he'd still have been well out even if Murphy had needed to collect the ball and remove the bails.

Finally, it was Kohli's turn to fall; on 186, he forewent a double-century for the cause, caught in the deep off Murphy to spark another wave of applause from an Ahmedabad crowd that, despite the dullness of the day, certainly got what they had hoped for.

With still time for six overs left in the day, Head and Kuhnemann safely, if not entirely comfortably, negotiated Ashwin and Jadeja until stumps; but with their chances of victory evaporated in the Indian sun, and with it hopes of a drawn series, the very best the visitors can hope for is to finish the tour with a grinding draw.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting order (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwatchman_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nightwatchman (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncer_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bouncer (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shami', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Mohammed Shami'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

After beginning the day unbeaten on 59, Kohli finished on 186 as India were eventually bowled out for 571 - ending with a first innings lead of 91 runs.

Day four began with an Australian win, an Indian win and a draw all possible results, but Kohli batted India to safety, ensuring that only two results remain possible on day five - an Indian win or a draw.

Following his tremendous knock, Kohli's wife, Anushka Sharma, took to social media to congratulate her husband.

""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always,"" she wrote in a tweet.

The century was Kohli's first in the red ball format since the 136 he scored against Bangladesh back in November 2019, a Test century drought spanning an incredible 23 matches.

Kohli remained without a century in 2020, 2021 and 2022 after notching at least two Test centuries in every year between 2012 and 2019.

The former Indian captain continued his tremendous record against Australia, making his eighth century in a Border-Gavaskar contest in 42 innings. Kohli's last century against Australia came in 2018 when he made 123 in Perth.

Despite his brilliance, Kohli was certainly not alone as KS Bharat (44) and Axar Patel (79) both proved valuable allies in ensuring India would end the day in a commanding position.

There were injury concerns for both sides on day four. India's Shreyas Iyer did not bat after being forced to have scans on a sore back, while Usman Khawaja injured his knee in a fielding mishap on the boundary.

After being forced off the field, Khawaja did not open Australia's second innings, with the No.11 from the first innings, Matthew Kuhnemann, accompanying Travis Head for a tricky six-over period to end the day's play.

While an Australian win is virtually out of the question, the tourists will want to win the first session on day five to ensure that an iconic Indian win mirroring Australia's unforgettable result against England in Adelaide in 2006 is impossible.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Not out'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anushka_Sharma', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Anushka Sharma'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

It leaves the Test heading for an almost certain draw after it took nearly four days to complete a first innings for each team.

Virat Kohli hit a wonderful century, his 28th, ending a 1206-day drought since his last Test hundred as he was the final man dismissed for 186.

But it once again raises questions about the pitch for the fourth and final Test.

Pitches have been a hot topic in this series between Australia and India after the three Tests were finished inside three days.

Crumbling dustbowls, including the Indore wicket which appeared to be little more than rubble from day one, are what the world has come to expect when touring India.

As a traditionally spin friendly nation, why wouldn't the nation play to its strengths?

Australia pitches have their own flavour, with Aussies choosing to highlight the pace and bounce our quick bowlers prefer.

As frustrating as it was for Australian fans, particularly in the first two Tests which saw monumental collapses hand the visitors' crushing losses, at least it had been a battle between the sides' spin bowlers.

Brutal batting conditions saw wickets fall at any moment with variable bounce and movement meaning batters were making little more than a guess at where the ball was going.

But with the series 2-1, Australia were hoping to win to draw the Border-Gavaskar series, after the humiliating losses in the opening two Tests.

However, with India needing a win to secure its place in the World Test Championship final -- a draw would allow Sri Lanka the possibility of sneaking in via two wins in its two-Test series against New Zealand -- the Ahmedabad curators went way too far in the opposite direction.

It's been a road with Usman Khawaja, Cameron Green, Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli all smashing big centuries.

Talking to Dinesh Karthik and Ravi Shastri just before the third new ball, Harsha Bhogle said he felt the pendulum had swung too far the other way.

""15 wickets have fallen over four days, we've gone the other extreme,"" Bhogle said.

Karthik replied: ""We need to talk about these numbers -- 91 wickets over 7 days and 15 wickets over 4 days.""

""So what do you want, this kind of a pitch or the other pitches?"" Shastri said. ""You don't want to finish in three days yes, totally agree, but that could also be because of incompetent batting.""

Bhogle replied: ""I think we went too far the other side.""

But Shastri wasn't done.

""I hope all those whingers about Indian pitches are happy now,"" he said.

It comes after the Indore pitch was rated ""poor"" after the Nagpur and Delhi pitches were both rated ""average"".

While most cricket fans prefer a battle between bat and ball where either could dominate, rarely do those pitches seem to truly eventuate.

And fans were left fuming over a boring four days of the fourth Test between the world's two top ranked cricket nations.

However, there could still be a result in the match, although there is almost no chance of Australia wrestling a result.

India were finally dismissed for 571 when Kohli holed out on 186.

It's a lead of 91 and Australia would have to get ahead and then pile on enough runs to try and bowl India out, which proved exceedingly difficult in the first innings.

Axar Patel's 79 off 113 balls showed just how true the wicket was, hitting four sixes and five fours before his stumps were skittled by Mitchell Starc.

As for India, there is hope.

At lunch, Brad Haddin said on Fox Cricket that India are trying to bat long enough that ""when Australia go into bat, they have nothing to play for.""

He said that could be all that decides a result as ""it's dangerous to bat when there's nothing to play for.""

Australia finished the day 0/3 with Travis Head on 3 alongside nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann on 0, 88 runs behind India.

10.45pm - Australia survive

India have bowled six overs and Matt Kuhnemann and Travis Head are still batting.

While there's not much to play for on day five, a draw would put keep the World Test Championship final placings alive with Sri Lanka able to jump into second position if India draw with two wins in New Zealand

10.00pm - India dismissed for 571

India are finally all out after two days, leaving just one day to complete the second innings.

After 91 wickets fell in about 7 days worth of cricket in the first three Tests, 20 wickets have fallen for 1051 runs over four days in Ahmedabad.

Kohli was the last man out for an incredible 186.

But he was ably assisted by Axar Patel, who smashed 79 off 113 balls including five fours and four sixes in his innings before he was bowled by Mitchell Starc.

8.20pm - India hit the front

In the final session on day four, India have surpassed Australia's first innings total.

Through almost four days we've seen more than 960 runs scored with Virat Kohli closing in on reaching the 150 mark.

6.15pm - Kohli snaps insane century drought

Virat Kohli has saluted the heavens for the first time in Test cricket in more than three years after reaching triple figures on Sunday.

It had been 1206 days since his last Test century, but on a pitch offering little to the bowlers he showed his class as he punished the Aussie attack.

The century makes it number 28 for him throughout his historic Test career. 16 of which have come against Australia.

Nathan Lyon has done the trick by removing Srikar Bharat, the man who had the crowd up and off their feet with his masterful hitting.

From around the wicket the Aussie spinner got one to bite off the pitch, catching the inside edge of Bharat as it hit his pad and spooned in the air before it was comfortably taken by Peter Handscomb.

5.50pm - Indian star dispatches Green to all parts

Cameron Green just had an over to forget as Srikar Bharat pummeled him to all parts of the ground.

After getting Virat Kohli off strike, the towering Aussie was hoisted over the rope in back-to-back deliveries before changing tactics.

The slight change didn't slow Bharat down as he cut one behind point for four. A total of 21 runs came off the over which included two no balls.

Virat Kohli is looking to end a three-year test century drought and has moved to 88 at lunch of day four.

India are in no rush and apart from a rush of blood from Ravindra Jadeja saw Australia claim just one wicket in the session.

India are content on chasing the draw at this point, and still trail by 118 runs on the first innings.

Australia need the win to draw the series but India seem content to play for a draw or gamble that Australia will once again implode with the series gone.

Brad Haddin said India are trying to bat long enough that ""when Australia go into bat, they have nothing to play for.""

He said that could be all that decides the result as ""it's dangerous to bat when there's nothing to play for.""

3.35pm - 'What has happened?' Brain fade costs India

India have lost its fourth wicket after Ravindra Jadeja got himself out for 28, chipping a Todd Murphy ball to Usman Khawaja at mid-on.

It was a bizarre moment as India were looking to consolidate their innings, having batted patiently in the first half an hour of the day.

""What has he done here?"" Harsha Bhogle exclaimed. ""The last couple of deliveries, Ravindra Jadeja has played shots completely out of character with what he's done for the rest and has given Australia a wicket on a platter.""

Sunil Gavaskar was equally perplexed.

""What has happened?"" he said. ""Did somebody say anything to him?

""Then suddenly this particular over he's gone the aerial route.

""What is this shot? Kohli's not impressed, the changeroom's not going to be impressed, I can tell you that, Rahul Dravid the coach, is not going to be impressed by this shot. And he'd played such a responsible innings before that, therefore this is a shot hard to understand.""

But Australia will take it as wickets are at a premium in this match.

It could be as good as two wickets down as Shreyas Iyer has also got a back injury and has gone for a scan.

2.30pm - Lyon optimistic despite lifeless pitch

Nathan Lyon remains upbeat Australia can pull a rabbit out of the hat over the course of the final two days and finish the series locked up at 2-2.

The opening three Tests all finished inside of three days, but the final is looking certain to go down to the wire with Lyon believing a late result is still in play provided the bowlers can apply the pressure early.

""Over here what I've learned, the black soil seems to hold together a lot better than the red soil,"" Nathan Lyon.

""There's not an overly great deal of footmarks out there to hit for spinners.

""We may see it start to go up and down a little bit more. But even talking to 'Starcy', he's putting in a lot of effort and the ball just seems to be stopping in the wicket.

""With the warmer weather here hopefully there's still a result in this game. We've just got to bowl well in the morning and get the pressure in their change room.

""These are the type of Test matches that are won in the last half-an-hour of day five, and these are the type of Test matches you want to be a part of.

""The hard grind with a potential great reward at the end of it. They're challenging, but we're all up for a challenge, and it's a proper grind, good Test cricket.""

Lyon was full of praise for his spin counterparts in Todd Murphy and Matt Kuhnemann who have continued to toil away in trying conditions.

""It's a big moment for the two young spinners and I think they bowled exceptionally well,"" Lyon said.

""I think it's pretty even. We know games in this part of the world can speed up quickly.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsha_Bhogle', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Harsha Bhogle'}}, {'uri':

That's the assessment of one of cricket's sharpest judges, Mark Waugh, after Kohli broke a 1207-day Test century drought to post his 28th career hundred for India.

The innings was a reminder of Kohli's single-minded determination .. but he is not the player he once was.

Given it was in Adelaide in 2012 that Kohli first announced himself as a cricketing megastar, Australia has experienced the three stages of the run-master's career.

From fearless youngster, to combative general, and now the smiling sage.

Last time Australia toured India in 2017, Kohli virtually went to war with Steve Smith, accusing him of cheating in a volcanic press conference in Bangalore.

Four years on, and Kohli has spent much of his 242-ball hundred chatting with Smith, including a pow wow on day three where they both stood at a drinks' break forensically examining the blade of Kohli's bat.

Kohli's three-year wait for his 28th Test hundred has weighed on him heavily.

He gave up the Test captaincy last year after the burden became too great, and even in this Test he has resisted his normal urge to move the scoreboard on in pursuit of victory to knuckle down and make a bird of breaking his hundred drought.

Kohli hit just five boundaries in his 100, and none in the two and a half hours he batted on day four before passing triple figures.

In the three years and three months it's taken to finally add to his ton tally, Kohli's average has dipped below 50 and no-longer plays the game with that assassins mentality.

Although a couple of the death stars he gave batting partners KS Bharat and Ravi Jadeja on day four showed he still has the eye of the tiger.

So how do you compare Kohli to the other demi-God of Indian cricket, Sachin Tendulkar?

According to Waugh, who played against Tendulkar and has commentated on Kohli, it's clear that Sachin is the GOAT with 51 Test centuries and an average of 53.78 compared to Kohli's 48.

But there is a key trait, not necessarily measured in statistics that sets Kohli apart from even the great one.

""There's a bit more fear involved in Kohli,"" Waugh said on Fox Cricket.

""Because just the way he plays the game. There's a different aura about Kohli.""

Ex-great Brad Haddin - who played against both Tendulkar and Kohli - said there is no doubt Indian players still ""walk on eggshells"" around the cricketer who has modelled his training, diet and approach to tennis killer, Novak Djokovic.

On day three of this Test, the crowd at Ahmedabad were chanting ""Kohli, Kohli"", even before previous batsman Cheteshwar Pujara had been given out on DRS to bring the great man to the crease.

Like Tendulkar, Indians come to watch Kohli and often leave the ground when he is out.

He cannot go out in public in India, so all-encompassing is his superstardom.

""He's a global icon,"" Matthew Hayden said on Fox.

""One of the greatest athletes of all time. Shane Warne, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods. He's right up there in that category.""

Kohli's legacy is he is the man who reinvigorated Indian cricket.

He single-handedly changed the attitude of Indian cricket, and in doing so unlocked the potential the subcontinental giants always had to conquer the world as a cricketing super power.

With Kohli, in the driver's seat, India became a force overseas.

Kohli was one of the rare cricketers to look Australia in the eye, and beat them at their own game of mental and physical intimidation.

Even in his decline, Kohli's stamp is all over modern India.

A cricketer for the ages who has transcended the sport.

The left-hander limped off the field and remained sidelined for nearly two hours while India batted, and did not come out to bat late in the afternoon as nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann opened alongside Travis Head.

""He has soreness in his left lower leg, just below the knee on the outside of the lower leg. Will be assessed again at the ground,"" a team spokesman said, per News Corp.

""He did have a (MRI) scan, which is standard procedure. The imaging did not reveal anything conclusive.""

India's tactics 'hard to watch' amid Kohli epic: Australia's 'faultless' unsung hero: Talking Points

Miracle play ends nine-hour Kohli epic as Aussies make shock opener call: Day 4 wrap

Khawaja will undergo a fitness Test to decide whether he can bat. If he is unable to pad up on the final day of the Border Gavaskar Trophy series, it could prove a serious impediment to Australia's hopes of batting the full day and ensuring a draw.

Meanwhile, India risks missing out on the World Test Championship final with a draw - something which would make their decision to serve up an absolute road for the final Test a terrible mistake.

Australia secured their place in June's final with victory in the third Test in Indore. But a draw could see India miss out should Sri Lanka stun New Zealand 2-0 in their current tour of Australia's neighbours.

New Zealand is currently 1/36 in their second innings on Day Five of the first Test, chasing a target of 285 runs to win - but a rain delay means Sri Lanka has just 49 overs remaining to bowl the hosts out. A draw is likely - meaning India will join Australia in the WTC final in England.

While a draw looms in Christchurch, it also appears the most likely outcome in Ahmedabad.

Asked about the possibility of a result on day five, India's Axar Patel said at stumps on day four: ""Anything can happen anytime, especially if we take two early wickets and they come under pressure - but this isn't a pitch where we can run through them. We will have to work hard, remain patient, and keep bowling in the right areas.""

He added the hosts were surprised at how well the pitch held up - remaining completely in favour of batters even through four days.

Patel said: ""We were a bit surprised with the pitch. Thought there will be a bit of purchase off it but haven't got it. We were surprised that the first innings ended on day four ... There are no footmarks, nothing.""

It was easily the most interesting thing to happen in this Test.

Here are the ratings for the fourth Test between India and Australia.

Grade: D-

Australia won the toss and, on a flat pitch, Usman Khawaja batted serenely under no threat from any of the Indian bowlers, eventually reaching a century.

Later, Cameron Green - the biggest puppy in world cricket - also scored his first century for Australia, cutting Ravindra Jadeja for four to bring up the ton.

Good puppy. Good giant puppy.

Probably the only disappointment was that the tall-rounder didn't bring up the milestone while wearing a baggy green. Or, for that matter, wearing clothes a couple of sizes too big for him, so that he was a baggy Green. Or, ideally, both.

Ah well, maybe next Test century.

(And, yes, we know it's hard to find clothes a couple of sizes too big for Cameron Green, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try!)

Grade: B+

With all the effortless run-scoring, it was the kind of Test where you could easily doze off for a session or two and feel as if you didn't miss anything.

Why, at one point on, I want to say, day twelve or thirteen, I watched an entire episode of Australian Survivor and returned to find the same partnership still going.

Proper Test cricket. It stands in stark contrast to those dreadful Bazball Tests, where even a twenty-minute doze sees you running the risk of waking up in a transformed hellscape where everything you've previously known is gone forever.

Still, if you did want to make an innings more frantic, why not have a secret stump session, in which the fielding team is allowed to give the off stump to a secret fielder to hide in the back of their shirt. During that time, the batter is only permitted to leave the ball if they can tell the umpire or opposition captain who has the missing stump.

Batters are always banging on about knowing where their off stump is. Let them prove it.

Grade: A

With the cricket wonderfully sedate, the commentators tried hard to capture our attention.

Matthew Hayden attempted a Ferrari analogy that was highly detailed but went nowhere (maybe because of a busted carburettor? I don't know much about cars).

I'm quite certain Hayden knows infinitely more than I do about batting in a Test match and yet every word he utters somehow makes me doubt that self-evident truth. A gift.

As mental as Hayden was, however, Sunil Gavaskar trumped him effortlessly, at one point delving deep into Mark Waugh's playbook and pulling an 'I haven't seen much of him' on Steve Smith.

Wonderful stuff from Gavaskar. Wish he'd expanded it further.

""This Kohli chap. What's his go?""

""That Stokes fellow? Is he a bowler or a batter? A bit of both? Huh. Good for him.""

And so on and so forth.

With bat dominating ball for the first time this series, however, it also finally gave the India commentators an opportunity to indulge in their favourite pastime of gushing with lyrical enthusiasm over the strokeplay of the batters.

Indian commentator: ""This sublime genius, his unparalleled skill giving us a glimpse into the heavenly realms, the crack of the bat a transcendent song welcoming us into a higher state of bliss, the timing of his shot a hint of the clockwork nature of the cosmos, ticking along with the orderly beauty of a wisdom greater than we dare contemplate.""

Australian commentator: ""Yes, but also crap bowling.""

Grade: D

With no other way to dismiss the Indian batters, Australia reached into their Cricket Australia-endorsed bag of tricks, and pulled out the rarely used tactic of letting their opponents bat for so long they got cramp.

Ruthless stuff from the Australians, but also effective stuff as Shubman Gill eventually succumbed for 128 after suffering from the ol' muscle hiccups.

Later, Virat Kohli was also tricked into some cramp after scoring a mere 186 runs that denied Australia any chance of victory.

India finished their first innings 91 runs ahead of Australia with just fifteen minutes or so remaining on the fourth day. Should the six days lost earlier in the series have been added to the end of this Test?

It would still have been a draw, of course, but at least we'd have seen, I dunno, Mitchell Starc and Todd Murphy put on 200 together.

Grade: B+

Heading into the final day, then, India had one eye on the New Zealand-Sri Lanka Test taking place simultaneously.

For India to definitively join Australia in the World Test Championship Final, they needed to either win this Test or have Sri Lanka not win their Test.

This was multi-dimensional cricket, across different hemispheres and only partially shared time zones. A fascinating contest that required serious concentration and thought.

Or, if you were Australia and already qualified for the final, you just had some fun and opened your batting with Matt Kuhnemann as nightwatchman. A nightwatchkuhnemann!

Can a man named Kuhnemann score a Test century? Perhaps, but not this Test, robbed of an opportunity by an LBW that Travis Head refused to let him review.

Nevertheless, with New Zealand sneaking home against Sri Lanka in a final ball, two-wicket thriller (just a week or so after a gripping one-run win after following on against England), neither India nor Australia could be bothered manufacturing anything in this Test, and it petered out to a tedious draw.

All Test cricket to take place in New Zealand from now on, I say.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}},
