On Friday, the US Department of Homeland Security announced the formation of an Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board that consists of 22 members pulled from the tech industry, government, academia, and civil rights organizations. But given the nebulous nature of the term ""AI,"" which can apply to a broad spectrum of computer technology, it's unclear if this group will even be able to agree on what exactly they are safeguarding us from.

Further Reading

President Biden directed DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to establish the board, which will meet for the first time in early May and subsequently on a quarterly basis.

The fundamental assumption posed by the board's existence, and reflected in Biden's AI executive order from October, is that AI is an inherently risky technology and that American citizens and businesses need to be protected from its misuse. Along those lines, the goal of the group is to help guard against foreign adversaries using AI to disrupt US infrastructure; develop recommendations to ensure the safe adoption of AI tech into transportation, energy, and Internet services; foster cross-sector collaboration between government and businesses; and create a forum where AI leaders to share information on AI security risks with the DHS.

It's worth noting that the ill-defined nature of the term ""Artificial Intelligence"" does the new board no favors regarding scope and focus. AI can mean many different things: It can power a chatbot, fly an airplane, control the ghosts in Pac-Man, regulate the temperature of a nuclear reactor, or play a great game of chess. It can be all those things and more, and since many of those applications of AI work very differently, there's no guarantee any two people on the board will be thinking about the same type of AI.

This confusion is reflected in the quotes provided by the DHS press release from new board members, some of whom are already talking about different types of AI. While OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic are monetizing generative AI systems like ChatGPT based on large language models (LLMs), Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, refers to entirely different classes of machine learning when he says, ""By driving innovative tools like crew resourcing and turbulence prediction, AI is already making significant contributions to the reliability of our nation's air travel system.""

So, defining the scope of what AI exactly means -- and which applications of AI are new or dangerous -- might be one of the key challenges for the new board.

A roundtable of Big Tech CEOs attracts criticism

For the inaugural meeting of the AI Safety and Security Board, the DHS selected a tech industry-heavy group, populated with CEOs of four major AI vendors (Sam Altman of OpenAI, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, and Dario Amodei of Anthopic), CEO Jensen Huang of top AI chipmaker Nvidia, and representatives from other major tech companies like IBM, Adobe, Amazon, Cisco, and AMD. There are also reps from big aerospace and aviation: Northrop Grumman and Delta Air Lines.

Upon reading the announcement, some critics took issue with the board composition. On LinkedIn, founder of The Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR) Timnit Gebru especially criticized OpenAI's presence on the board and wrote, ""I've now seen the full list and it is hilarious. Foxes guarding the hen house is an understatement.""","[{'uri': 'benj_edwards@arstechnica.com', 'name': 'Benj Edwards', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri':

If you haven't heard of the Rabbit R1, this is yet another ""AI box"" that is trying to replace your smartphone with a voice command device that runs zero apps. Just like the Humane AI Pin, this thing recently launched and seems to be dead on arrival as a completely non-viable device that doesn't solve any real problems, has terrible battery life, and is missing big chunks of core functionality. Before the device fades into obscurity, though, Android Authority's Mishaal Rahman looked at the software and found the ""smartphone replacement"" device just runs a smartphone OS. It's Android -- both an Android OS and Android app, just in a very limited $200 box.

OK, technically, we can't call it ""Android"" since that's a Google trademark that you only get access to after licensing Google Play. It runs AOSP (the Android Open Source Project codebase), which is the open source bits of Android without any proprietary Google code. The interface -- which is mostly just a clock, settings screen, and voice input -- is also just an Android app. Being a normal Android app means you can install it on an Android phone, and Rahman was able to get the Rabbit R1 software running on a Pixel 6. He even got the AI assistant to answer questions on the phone.

Rabbit Inc. does not sound happy about Rahman's discovery. The company posted on X that it is ""aware there are some unofficial rabbit OS app/website emulators out there"" and that since it does not want to support ""third-party clients,"" a ""local bootleg APK without the proper OS and Cloud endpoints won't be able to access our service."" The company describes its device as a ""very bespoke AOSP and lower level firmware modifications,"" but that's a statement that would be true for many phones. In another statement to Rahman, the company threatens that ""We reserve all rights for any malicious and illegal cyber security activities towards our services.""

It's unclear why the company seems to be so mad about the details of its tech stack being public, but from a technical standpoint, Rabbit Inc. is right to use Android, or specifically as much of AOSP as it can. Forget about all the Google Play stuff -- if you have something that needs to connect a mobile network, manage charge states, light up a touchscreen, work hardware inputs and a camera, and use an SoC in a power-efficient way, AOSP already does all of this for you. It's open source and can be used without any connections, obligations, or tracking from Google. You'd need to have a very good reason to spend a bunch of time and money reinventing all of this code when AOSP is free, it works well, and it's the de facto industry standard to run mobile components. This line of thinking aligns with Google's master plan in making Android open source, and it ultimately makes sense.

Further ReadingThe next question for a hardware developer is, ""Should we use the app framework?"" and that's another thing that is hard to argue with re-inventing. The Android app framework will solve a million problems you probably already need to solve, let you define screens and navigation, handle inputs and settings, and countless other features. The next part of Android's strategy is ""Why not also sign up for Google Play and sign on the dotted line with Google, Inc?"" This comes with a lot of cloud stuff like push notifications, online storage, millions of smartphone apps, all the proprietary Google code and tracking, and many restrictions and qualifications. A big chunk of those restrictions are around app compatibility, and that makes Google Play non-viable for a weird in-betweener device like the Rabbit R1. If you can't smoothly slot into one of the categories of ""smartwatch,"" ""smartphone,"" ""tablet,"" ""TV"" or ""car app,"" Google Play doesn't have a place for you.

The Rabbit devs didn't want to make a normal device with a million smartphone apps, so skipping Google Play was the right choice. Since you can only use the name ""Android"" -- a registered Google trademark -- in marketing if you sign up with Google Play, the company can't exactly shout from the rooftops about what codebase it's using. Rabbit's opening sales pitch that it wants to ""break away from the app-based operating system currently used by smartphones"" feels a bit disingenuous when it's using the exact operating system it's hinting at, but from a technical standpoint, these feel like all the right decisions.

For the record, the Humane AI Pin also ran AOSP. The free and open source nature of AOSP makes it the obvious choice for mobile hardware that's smaller than a laptop, VR headsets, digital signage, and a million other things that don't need the expense or app compatibility of Windows. Nowadays, I just assume any new device from a startup is AOSP-based unless proven otherwise.","[{'uri': 'ron_amadeo@arstechnica.com', 'name': 'Ron Amadeo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Android (operating system)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Operating system'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Google Play'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Smartphone'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Google'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Artificial intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Copyright infringement'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Open-source software'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Software'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Mobile app'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_user_interface', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Voice user interface'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bit'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Proprietary software'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Trademark'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pixel 6'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Emulator'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Firmware'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cellular network'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Virtual assistant'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'System on a chip'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Computer security'}}]",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/r1-interface.desktop-760x380.jpg,eng-9525510,-0.050980392,452278447,1,arstechnica.com,news,Ars Technica,Android (operating system) Operating system Google Play Smartphone Google Artificial intelligence Copyright infringement Open-source software Software Mobile app Voice user interface Bit Proprietary software Trademark Pixel 6 Emulator Firmware Cellular network Virtual assistant System on a chip Computer security,arstechnica.com,827,Artificial Intelligence,2024,5,1,54,16,2024-05-01

On Wednesday, Anthropic announced the launch of an iOS mobile app for its Claude 3 AI language models that are similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT. It also introduced a new subscription tier designed for group collaboration. Before the app launch, Claude was only available through a website, an API, and other apps that integrated Claude through API.

Further Reading

Like the ChatGPT app, Claude's new mobile app serves as a gateway to chatbot interactions, and it also allows uploading photos for analysis. While it's only available on Apple devices for now, Anthropic says that an Android app is coming soon.

Anthropic rolled out the Claude 3 large language model (LLM) family in March, featuring three different model sizes: Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku. Currently, the app utilizes Sonnet for regular users and Opus for Pro users.

While Anthropic has been a key player in the AI field for several years, it's entering the mobile space after many of its competitors have already established footprints on mobile platforms. OpenAI released its ChatGPT app for iOS in May 2023, with an Android version arriving two months later. Microsoft released a Copilot iOS app in January. Google Gemini is available through the Google app on iPhone.

The app is freely available to all users of Claude, including those using the free version, subscribers paying $20 per month for Claude Pro, and members of the newly introduced Claude Team plan. Conversation history is saved and shared between the web app version of Claude and the mobile app version after logging in.

Speaking of that Team plan, it's designed for groups of at least five and is priced at $30 per seat per month. It offers more chat queries (higher rate limits), access to all three Claude models, and a larger context window (200K tokens) for processing lengthy documents or maintaining detailed conversations. It also includes group admin tools and billing management, and users can easily switch between Pro and Team plans.","[{'uri': 'benj_edwards@arstechnica.com', 'name': 'Benj Edwards', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Anthropic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'ChatGPT'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Mobile app'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'IOS'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'API'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Artificial intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Language model'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Android (operating system)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chatbot'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'OpenAI'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Mobile operating system'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Large language model'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Apple Inc.'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Google'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Web application'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'App Store (iOS/iPadOS)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Microsoft'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'IPhone'}}]",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Claude-iOS-App-2-760x380.jpg,eng-9528124,0.035294118,452296701,1,arstechnica.com,news,Ars Technica,Anthropic ChatGPT Mobile app IOS API Artificial intelligence Language model Android (operating system) Chatbot OpenAI Mobile operating system Large language model Apple Inc.

Most people would probably be hard-pressed to tell the new ones from the old ones just by looking at them, but after hands-on sessions with both sizes of both tablets, the small details (especially for the Pros) all add up to a noticeably refined iPad experience.

iPad Airs: Bigger is better

But let's begin with the new Airs, since there's a bit less to talk about. The 11-inch iPad Air (technically the 6th-generation model) is mostly the same as the previous-generation A14 and M1 models, design-wise, with identical physical dimensions and weight. It's still the same slim-bezel design Apple introduced with the 2018 iPad Pro, just with a 60 Hz LCD display panel and Touch ID on the power button rather than Face ID.

Further Reading

So when Apple says it's been ""redesigned,"" what the company is mainly referencing is the fact that the webcam is now mounted on the long edge of the tablet rather than the short edge. This makes its positioning more laptop-y when it's docked to the Magic Keyboard or some other keyboard.

The most welcome change to the Air is the introduction of a 13-inch model (blessedly, no longer ""12.9 inches""). It looks like the old 12.9-inch iPad Pro design from circa 2018 but with the simpler single-lens 12MP camera and the Touch ID button rather than the Face ID sensor.

With the iPad Pro and the Air next to each other, it's clear which has the superior screen -- the 120 Hz refresh rate of ProMotion and the infinite contrast of OLED are definitely major points in the Pro's favor. But if you're just looking for a big screen for watching videos, reading books, or playing games, or if you're just looking for a general-use laptop replacement tablet, Apple is still using a great 60 Hz LCD panel here. And the $799 price tag is considerably lower than any of Apple's past 12.9-inch iPad Pros.

Like the 15-inch MacBook Air, it's a way for people to get a bigger screen without paying for advanced screen technologies or faster processors if they don't want or need them.
