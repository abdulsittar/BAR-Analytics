The United Nations, the Syrian government and other actors are responsible for delays in getting emergency aid to Syrians after the devastating earthquakes last month, a UN-appointed commission of inquiry says.

The allegations, shared on Monday, add to a growing chorus of criticism of the global body for its role in the immediate aftermath of last month's earthquakes that killed some 6,000 people in Syria, mostly in the rebel-held northwest near the Turkish border.

The actors failed to secure an immediate pause in hostilities, or to facilitate life-saving aid through any available route, including for rescue teams in the crucial first week, the independent three-member panel set up to investigate and record all violations of international law since March 2011 in the country, said.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the Government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission, in a statement.

The statement added that the identified actors had failed to agree a pause in hostilities and to allow life-saving aid through any available route, leaving Syrians feeling ""abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times"".

""Many voices are rightly calling for an investigation and for accountability.""

President Bashar al-Assad's government took a week to consent to cross-border aid access, said the commission.

The UN estimates that five million people need basic shelter and non-food assistance in the quake-hit part of Syria.

""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe. Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" he added.

The Syrian conflict started in 2011. Since then, nearly half a million people have been killed and about half of Syria's pre-war population has been forced from their homes.

They failed to secure an immediate pause in hostilities, or to facilitate life-saving aid through any available route, including for rescue teams in the crucial first week following the February 6 quake, the commission said.

The independent three-member panel, set up to investigate and record all violations of international law since March 2011 in the country, said they were now probing fresh attacks since the February 6 quake -- attacks they branded incomprehensible.

""Syrians felt abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times. Many voices are rightly calling for an investigation and for accountability,"" the panel said in a statement.

President Bashar al-Assad's government took a week to consent to cross-border aid access, said the commission.

Almost 6,000 people were killed in Syria by the 7.8-magnitude tremor that struck the country and neighbouring Turkey.

The UN estimates that five million people need basic shelter and non-food assistance in the quake-hit part of Syria.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the UN, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said commission chair Paulo Pinheiro.

The Syrian conflict started in 2011 with Assad's brutal repression of peaceful protests, and escalated to pull in multiple foreign powers and global jihadists.

Nearly half a million people have been killed, and the conflict has forced around half of Syria's pre-war population from their homes.

The commission issued its latest report Monday, covering violations committed in the second half of 2022.

""More than 13 million people are displaced or refugees at a time when 90 percent of all Syrian civilians live in poverty, and 15.3 million are estimated to require humanitarian assistance to survive -- the highest level of people in need since the start of the conflict,"" the report said.

The United Nations, the Syrian government and other actors are responsible for delays in getting emergency aid to Syrians after last month's earthquake, a U.N.-appointed commission of inquiry said on Monday, describing the failures as ""shocking"" and calling for a separate investigation. The allegations add to a growing chorus of criticism of the global body for its role in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that killed some 6,000 people in Syria, mostly in the rebel-held northwest near the Turkish border.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the Government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission. The parties involved also failed to agree on a pause in hostilities and to allow life-saving aid through any available route, leaving Syrians feeling ""abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" it said.

""The Syrian population has a right to the truth - why they received this treatment,"" Pinheiro added at a later press conference. Of the delays in U.N. aid, another member of the three-person commission, Hanny Megally, told Reuters: ""You don't wait for permission to act in an emergency and that was what was shocking for us.""

Even when aid did begin flowing, days after the Feb. 6 quake, he said it was a backlog of food and other supplies and not the bulldozers and cranes needed to lift the debris or the medical equipment that could have treated the crush injuries of the rescued. Syria's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) spokesperson said 720 trucks loaded with aid has so far arrived in northwest Syria using three border crossings. He confirmed that no heavy equipment was sent in, saying this was the type of aid that only national authorities can provide. Syria's government says humanitarian aid should go via territory under its control, although supplies to the northwest are allowed across the border from neighbouring Turkey under a U.N. Security Council agreement.

Last month's earthquake added to misery for people suffering from the consequences of 12 years of civil war, with more than 4 million people reliant on aid before it struck. The independent commission was established to investigate violations by all parties to the conflict. Commission member Lynn Welchman also said on Monday that the body planned to follow-up on an Israeli air strike that knocked Aleppo airport of service, forcing aid flights to be rerouted.

Parties to the Syrian conflict prevented access to areas affected by the earthquake, the UN Syria Commission of Inquiry said on Monday.

In the months leading up to the region's most devastating earthquakes in more than a century, parties to the conflict in Syria ""widely violated and abused human rights,"" continuing a 10-year pattern of disregard for the safety of Syrian citizens, the commission said in a briefing in Geneva where they launched their latest report on the country's crisis.

""In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, it took the Syrian Government a full week to consent to life-saving cross-border aid access,"" the commission of three stressed.

The Syrian regime and opposition ""both impeded cross-line aid to affected communities, while Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) in northwest Syria refused cross-line aid from Damascus,"" according to the commission.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission.

""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe. Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" Pinheiro said.

Commissioner Hanny Megally, for his part, said they are currently investigating several allegations of parties to the conflict deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid to the affected communities and added: ""As aid is now finally increasing, it is more important than ever that they consent to impartial humanitarian relief being delivered unimpeded to those in need, whether through cross-border or cross-line modalities.""

Regarding the restricted rights of women and girls by the armed groups in the earthquake-affected areas, Lynn Welchman, the commissioner of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, said they have regularly restricted the rights of women and girls.

""Today, most of those without shelter in these areas are girls and women, many of them heading households, and the scaling up of aid must consider the gendered impact of the crisis,"" Welchman added.

The commission's report, which was written prior to the devastating earthquakes, gives a rundown of the wrongdoings against people in Syria. On March 21, it will deliver its findings to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.â€¨

The Feb. 6 earthquakes which were centered in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras, affected more than 13 million people across 11 provinces, including Hatay, Adana, Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Adiyaman, Malatya, Kilis, Osmaniye, Elazig and Sanliurfa.

Several countries in the region, including Syria and Lebanon, also felt the strong tremors that struck TÃ¼rkiye in fewer than 10 hours. -",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Euro'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Human rights'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Switzerland'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_al-Sham', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Tahrir al-Sham'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Roman province'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Human Rights Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Turkey', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Provinces of Turkey'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Adana'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Adana'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adıyaman', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Adıyaman'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Adıyaman'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyarbakır', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Diyarbakır'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Diyarbakır'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elâzığ', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Elâzığ'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Elâzığ'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaziantep', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Gaziantep'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Gaziantep'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatay_Province', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Hatay Province'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Hatay Province'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilis', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kilis'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kilis'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malatya', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Malatya'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Malatya'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmaniye', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Osmaniye'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Osmaniye'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urfa', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Urfa'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Urfa'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Lebanon'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Lebanon'}}}]",,eng-8471915,-0.0980392156862745,416411940,1,en.haberler.com,news,Haberler.com,Syrian Civil War Earthquake Humanitarian aid Euro Syria United Nations Human rights Geneva Tahrir al-Sham Damascus Roman province United Nations Human Rights Council Provinces of Turkey Adana Adıyaman Diyarbakır Elâzığ Gaziantep Hatay Province Kilis Malatya Osmaniye Urfa Lebanon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,59,13,2023-03-13

GENEVA (13 March 2023) -- Parties to the conflict in Syria committed widespread human rights violations and abuses in the months leading up to the most devastating earthquakes to hit the region in more than a century, continuing a decade-long pattern of failures to protect Syrian civilians, the UN Syria Commission of Inquiry said Monday after launching their latest report on the country's crisis.

The response to the recent massive earthquakes was characterised by additional failures that hindered the delivery of urgent and life-saving aid to northwest Syria. These failures implicated the Government and other parties to the conflict as well as the international community and the United Nations. They failed to secure agreement on an immediate pause in hostilities. They failed to allow and facilitate life-saving aid through any available route, including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake. Syrians felt abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times. Many voices are rightly calling for an investigation and for accountability.

Today, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria launches its latest report just ahead of the 12th anniversary of the Syrian crisis, documenting ongoing violations of human rights and humanitarian law throughout the country in the last six months of 2022, including the particularly appalling situation for Syrians along frontlines in the north and northwest.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the Government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, Chair of the Commission. ""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe. Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" he added. These include last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid.

In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, it took the Syrian Government a full week to consent to life-saving cross-border aid access. The Government and opposition Syrian National Army (SNA) both impeded cross-line aid to affected communities, while Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) in northwest Syria refused cross-line aid from Damascus.

""We are currently investigating several allegations of parties to the conflict deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid to the affected communities,"" said Commissioner Hanny Megally. ""As aid is now finally increasing, it is more important than ever that they consent to impartial humanitarian relief being delivered unimpeded to those in need, whether through cross-border or cross-line modalities,"" he added.

Entire communities have been destroyed, with the UN estimating that some five million people require basic shelter and non-food assistance in the Syrian part of the earthquake zone. Already before the 6 February earthquakes, over 15 million Syrians - more than at any point since the start of the conflict - needed humanitarian assistance.

The Commission's report, prepared before the devastating earthquakes, provides a summary of violations and abuses committed against civilians in Syria. In Government-controlled areas, the Commission documented increasing insecurity in Dara'a, Suwayda' and Hama, and continuing arbitrary imprisonment, torture, ill-treatment and enforced disappearances. Violations of property rights included seizures, auctions and prohibitions on access to property.

Civilians living in the earthquake-affected northwest were particularly exposed to deadly attacks in the preceding months. In a single indiscriminate attack in November, Government forces used cluster munitions to strike densely populated displacement camps in Idlib governorate inside the opposition-held area, killing 7 civilians and injuring at least 60 more. In August, another indiscriminate attack involving ground-launched unguided rockets killed 16 civilians and injured 29 at and around a busy market in Al-Bab northeast of Aleppo. In July, airstrikes by the Aerospace Forces of the Russian Federation destroyed a civilian house in Judaydah, Jisr Shughour killing 7 members of a family and injuring 13 other civilians. These atrocities continue a long-established pattern of indiscriminate attacks, which may amount to war crimes.

Further, the Commission found that conditions for safe and dignified return are still not in place. Some Syrians were denied return outright, others were arbitrarily arrested or prevented from accessing their homes upon return to government-controlled areas during the reporting period.

In the northeast, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) continues to unlawfully hold 56,000 people, mainly women and children, with suspected family links to Da'esh fighters in Al-Hawl and Roj camps, where conditions continue to deteriorate. The Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that the suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity, and calls for repatriations to speed up.

Meanwhile, HTS in Idlib and SNA factions in western Aleppo tortured and arbitrarily detained people, including in a manner tantamount to enforced disappearance. Fundamental freedoms remained curtailed and critical voices were silenced in these areas. The Commission is investigating credible and multiple reports that HTS carried out executions by firing squad. In the areas controlled by the SNA the Commission documented hostage-taking, pillage and property confiscation.

Furthermore, armed groups in the earthquake-affected areas have regularly restricted the rights of women and girls. ""Today, most of those without shelter in these areas are girls and women, many of them heading households, and the scaling up of aid must consider the gendered impact of the crisis,"" said Commissioner Lynn Welchman.

Against this grim backdrop, there is a glimmer of hope for Syrian families looking for their missing relatives. The Commission has long supported the families' calls for an independent international entity to support the search for the missing and families of survivors and welcomes the first steps in this direction. Later this month, the Secretary-General is scheduled to brief the UN General Assembly on the issue of missing persons in Syria.

The Government and other parties to the conflict have deliberately prolonged the suffering of hundreds of thousands of family members by withholding information on the fate of those missing or disappeared for far too long.

""This must be a call to action,"" Pinheiro said, adding that ""this issue impacts people across the political and geographic spectrum in Syria and the upcoming briefing of the Secretary-General must lead to concrete action, without further delay.""

The Commission will present its report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday, 21 March.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5,

The allegations add to a growing chorus of criticism of the global body for its role in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that killed some 6,000 people in Syria, mostly in the rebel-held northwest near the Turkish border.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the Government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission.

The parties involved also failed to agree on a pause in hostilities and to allow life-saving aid through any available route, leaving Syrians feeling ""abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" it said.

""The Syrian population has a right to the truth - why they received this treatment,"" Pinheiro added at a later press conference.

Of the delays in U.N. aid, another member of the three-person commission, Hanny Megally, told Reuters: ""You don't wait for permission to act in an emergency and that was what was shocking for us.""

Even when aid did begin flowing, days after the Feb. 6 quake, he said it was a backlog of food and other supplies and not the bulldozers and cranes needed to lift the debris or the medical equipment that could have treated the crush injuries of the rescued.

Syria's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) spokesperson said 720 trucks loaded with aid has so far arrived in northwest Syria using three border crossings. He confirmed that no heavy equipment was sent in, saying this was the type of aid that only national authorities can provide.

Syria's government says humanitarian aid should go via territory under its control, although supplies to the northwest are allowed across the border from neighbouring Turkey under a U.N. Security Council agreement.

Last month's earthquake added to misery for people suffering from the consequences of 12 years of civil war, with more than 4 million people reliant on aid before it struck.

The independent commission was established to investigate violations by all parties to the conflict. Commission member Lynn Welchman also said on Monday that the body planned to follow-up on an Israeli air strike that knocked Aleppo airport of service, forcing aid flights to be rerouted.","[{'uri': 'stelios_marathovouniotis@in-cyprus.philenews.com', 'name': 'Stelios Marathovouniotis', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria–Turkey_border', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria–Turkey border'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_truth', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Right to truth'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldozer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bulldozer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Civil war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Independence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Reuters'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}]",https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-13T123730Z_1584427939_RC21NZ90ZP49_RTRMADP_3_TURKEY-QUAKE-SYRIA.jpg,eng-8471915,-0.2941176470588235,416412120,1,in-cyprus.philenews.com,news,in-cyprus.philenews.com,United Nations Syria Earthquake Syria–Turkey border International community Right to truth Humanitarian aid Bulldozer Airstrike United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Civil war United Nations Security Council Independence Reuters Aleppo Turkey Israel,Cyprus,CY,Greek,gre,Independent-liberal,https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiPhileleftheros,,C4,Europe,EU,Christian,34.0,43.0,32.0,35.0,69.0,37.0,32.0,35.0,42.0,32.0,29.0,34.0,38.0,,,,,,,European Union (EU),EU,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,2,14,2023-03-13

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims.

A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkiye to the countrys rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims.

The international community and the Syrian government did not act quickly last month to help people in need in the rebel-held northwest after a deadly earthquake hit Turkiye and Syria, a U.N. commission said Monday.

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkiye and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

It took a week for the U.N. and Syria's President Bashar Assad's government to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkiye as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva. He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.''

A U.N.-appointed commission said the Syrian government and the global body are responsible for the delays in ensuring the delivery of crucial aid to Syrians following the twin earthquakes that claimed over 50,000 lives in Türkiye and Syria last month.

The allegations add to a growing chorus of criticism of the U.N. for its role in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that killed some 6,000 people in Syria, mostly in the opposition-held northwest near the Turkish border.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the Government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the direst need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission.

The parties involved also failed to agree on a pause in hostilities and to allow life-saving aid through any available route, leaving Syrians feeling ""abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" it said.

""The Syrian population has a right to the truth - why they received this treatment,"" Pinheiro added at a later press conference.

Of the delays in U.N. aid, another member of the three-person commission, Hanny Megally, told Reuters: ""You don't wait for permission to act in an emergency and that was what was shocking for us.""

Even when aid did begin flowing, days after the Feb. 6 quake, he said it was a backlog of food and other supplies and not the bulldozers and cranes needed to lift the debris or the medical equipment that could have treated the crush injuries of the rescued.

Syria's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) spokesperson said 720 trucks loaded with aid has so far arrived in northwest Syria using three border crossings. He confirmed that no heavy equipment was sent in, saying this was the type of aid that only national authorities can provide.

Syria's government says humanitarian aid should go via territory under its control, although supplies to the northwest are allowed across the border from neighboring Türkiye under a U.N. Security Council agreement.

Last month's earthquake added to the misery for people suffering from the consequences of 12 years of civil war, with over 4 million people reliant on aid before it struck.

The independent commission was established to investigate violations by all parties to the conflict. Commission member Lynn Welchman also said on Monday that the body planned to follow up on an Israeli air strike that knocked Aleppo airport off service, forcing aid flights to be rerouted.","[{'uri': 'reuters@dailysabah.com', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria–Turkey_border', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria–Turkey border'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldozer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bulldozer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Civil war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Independence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Reuters'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}]",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2023/03/13/thumbs/800x531/262314.jpg,eng-8471915,-0.1215686274509804,416415540,1,dailysabah.com,news,Daily Sabah,Earthquake United Nations Syria Syria–Turkey border International community Humanitarian aid Bulldozer Airstrike United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Civil war United Nations Security Council Independence Reuters Aleppo Israel,Turkey,TR,,,,,C14,C12,Asia,AS,Muslim,95.0,147.0,152.0,128.0,137.0,68.0,65.0,50.0,71.0,59.0,63.0,74.0,86.0,66.0,37.0,45.0,85.0,46.0,49.0,,,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,59,14,2023-03-13

Parties to the Syrian conflict prevented access to areas affected by the earthquake, the UN Syria Commission of Inquiry said on Monday, Anadolu News Agency reports.

In the months leading up to the region's most devastating earthquakes in more than a century, parties to the conflict in Syria ""widely violated and abused human rights"", continuing a 10-year pattern of disregard for the safety of Syrian citizens, the Commission said in a briefing in Geneva where they launched their latest report on the country's crisis.

""In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, it took the Syrian Government a full week to consent to life-saving cross-border aid access,"" the Commission of three stressed.

The Syrian regime and opposition ""both impeded cross-line aid to affected communities, while Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS) in north-west Syria refused cross-line aid from Damascus,"" according to the Commission.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, Chair of the Commission.

""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe. Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" Pinheiro said.

Commissioner Hanny Megally, for his part, said they are currently investigating several allegations of parties to the conflict deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid to the affected communities and added: ""As aid is now finally increasing, it is more important than ever that they consent to impartial humanitarian relief being delivered unimpeded to those in need, whether through cross-border or cross-line modalities.""

Regarding the restricted rights of women and girls by the armed groups in the earthquake-affected areas, Lynn Welchman, the Commissioner of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, said they have regularly restricted the rights of women and girls.

""Today, most of those without shelter in these areas are girls and women, many of them heading households, and the scaling up of aid must consider the gendered impact of the crisis,"" Welchman added.

The Commission's report, which was written prior to the devastating earthquakes, gives a rundown of the wrongdoings against people in Syria. On 21 March, it will deliver its findings to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

The 6 February earthquakes, which were centred in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras, affected more than 13 million people across 11 provinces, including Hatay, Adana, Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Adiyaman, Malatya, Kilis, Osmaniye, Elazig and Sanliurfa.

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

It took a week for the U.N. and Syria's President Bashar Assad's government to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva. He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

""Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said. ""Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria which became the epicenter of neglect.""

A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims. Before that, the U.N. had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

""They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said, adding that ""Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who (are) supposed to protect them in their most desperate time.""

""Many voices are rightly calling ... for an investigation and accountability to understand how this failure, this disaster happened beyond the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said.

The February 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

* A month after Turkey and Syria quake, survivors need shelter, sanitation

* Turkey arrests contractors as earthquake deaths pass 33,000

* Survivors of Turkey-Syria earthquake struggle to stay warm and fed

It took a week for the UN and Syria's President Bashar Assad's government to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva.

He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria"".

""Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said. ""Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria, which became the epicentre of neglect.""

A week after the earthquake, the UN announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open, for three months, two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims.

Before that, the UN had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

""They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said, adding that ""Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who [are] supposed to protect them in their most desperate time"".

Speaking to reporters in Geneva, the commission's chairman Paulo Pinheiro called for an independent investigation into what he described as ""the wholesale failure by the [Syrian] government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct urgent life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need.""

""Many days were lost without any aid to the survivors of the earthquake"", said Mr Pinheiro.

The commission's three members did not specify which body should conduct the investigation, but said that while they did not doubt that the UN could conduct its own internal investigation, it would be best for the global body to be excluded.

""The good practice is that it should be independent of the parties involved in the failures, and in that sense of course the UN is in midst of that"", said Commissioner Hanny Megally.

The allegations add to a growing chorus of criticism of the UN for its role in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake and its aftershocks that killed about 6,000 people in Syria, mostly in the rebel-held north-west area near the Turkish border. At least 44,000 people died in Turkey.

""We were appalled, watching day by day, no aid coming into the north-west,"" said Mr Megally, who described the UN and the international community as ""paralysed"".

""People [were] saying: we need heavy equipment, we need search teams with dogs, people are still alive under the rubble, where is the UN, the international community, to help us, and they could see, not far away ... lots of international assistance being provided on the Turkish side of the border"", added Mr Megally.

""We're actually quite shocked that this happened and went on for days and days and over a week before there was an agreement reached with Damascus"", he continued. ""Shocking that Damascus would not have agreed immediately for it to come, but also shocking that the UN and the international community did not act more quickly.""

When it finally arrived, UN humanitarian aid was actually aid that was supposed to be sent to the region before the earthquake and was not intended for earthquake victims, Mr Megally said.

A UN humanitarian office (OCHA) representative told Reuters that 720 lorries loaded with aid has so far arrived in north-west Syria, using three border crossings. He confirmed that no heavy equipment was sent in, as this was the type of aid that only national authorities can provide.

Syria's government says humanitarian aid should go via territory under its control, although supplies to the north-west are allowed across the border from neighbouring Turkey under a UN Security Council agreement.

Mr Megally seemed to dismiss the need for the international community to go through the Security Council after a disaster of the magnitude of the earthquake.

""Legal scholars will argue that in exceptional circumstances, you can act, even if it means crossing boundaries or trampling on state sovereignty"", he said.

Commissioner Lynn Welchman criticised ""dysfunction"" at the UN Security Council. ""It's become impossible to avoid political brinkmanship in the Security Council on this issue at the expense of civilian lives and welfare"", she said.

The parties involved also failed to agree on a pause in hostilities following the earthquake. The commission is following up on a number of incidents, including strikes allegedly conducted by Israel last week on Aleppo airport, which is an important entry point for humanitarian aid into northern Syria.

""We were hoping that at least common sense would prevail, but sadly it did not"", said Mr Megally.

The commission's criticism overshadowed the presentation of its bi-annual report on human rights violations in Syria, which was prepared before the earthquake.

Based on 467 first-hand interviews, and documents showing satellite imagery and other information, the report found that in the past six months, the conflict has intensified across several front lines, and conditions for refugees' safe return are still not in place.

More than 15.3 million people will require humanitarian assistance this year compared to 14.6 million in 2022. This is the highest number of people in need since the beginning of the crisis.

The report found that civilians continue to be the target of arbitrary arrests, sexual violence, torture and killings at the hands of government and non-state groups across the country.

Civilians living in areas affected by the earthquake in north-west Syria were subject to indiscriminate cluster bombs launched by the Syrian government, said the report. On November 6, at least seven civilians living in a displacement camp were killed, including one woman and four children.

One of the most important Islamist groups in the area, Hayat Tahrir Al Sham, which also reportedly held up quake relief, has executed detainees -- including women -- by firing squad, the report found.

The report also called for the release or repatriation of 56,000 detainees, mostly women and children, held for the past four years for alleged ties to ISIS by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Al Hawl and Rawj camps in north-east Syria.

Asked whether one of the most high-profile detainees, Shamima Begum, who recently lost an appeal against the decision to revoke her British citizenship, should return to the UK, Ms Welchmann answered: ""Yes, I certainly think so.""

Kazakhstan, Russia and Uzbekistan were the countries that repatriated the most women and children from the camps, according to the report. A long list of countries including Austria, Iran and Romania have not repatriated any.

""Most countries have established legal systems to tackle these problems"", said Mr Megally, so ""why call on a non-state actor to take on that role?""","[{'uri': 'sunniva_rose@thenationalnews.com',

The Damascus government, other civil war factions, the international community and the United Nations itself hindered the delivery of urgent assistance to the quake-hit northwest, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said.

They failed to secure an immediate pause in hostilities, or to facilitate life-saving aid through any available route, including for rescue teams in the crucial first week following the February 6 quake, the commission said.

The panel, which investigates and records all international human rights law violations since March 2011 in the country, said they were now probing fresh attacks since the February 6 quake -- which they branded incomprehensible.

""Syrians felt abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" the independent three-member panel said in a statement, calling for a separate investigation into these failings.

President Bashar al-Assad's government took a week to consent to cross-border aid access, said the commission, with member Hanny Megally arguing that international aid should have gone in first, even if it meant skirting around state sovereignty.

- 15.3 million need aid -

Almost 6,000 people were killed in Syria by the 7.8-magnitude tremor that struck the country and neighbouring Turkey.

The UN estimates that five million people need basic shelter and non-food assistance in the quake-hit part of Syria.

Commission chair Paulo Pinheiro said Syria became an ""epicentre of neglect"", adding that the panel was probing multiple allegations of warring factions ""deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid"".

He slammed the ""wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the UN, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need"".

""Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" he added.

Megally said the shelling resumed within two or three days of the quake, and has continued since.

The Syrian conflict started in 2011 with Assad's brutal repression of peaceful protests, and escalated to pull in multiple foreign powers and global jihadists.

Nearly half a million people have been killed, and the conflict has forced around half of Syria's pre-war population from their homes.

- War crime allegations -

The commission issued its latest report Monday, covering violations committed in the second half of 2022.

""More than 13 million people are displaced or refugees at a time when 90 percent of all Syrian civilians live in poverty, and 15.3 million are estimated to require humanitarian assistance to survive -- the highest level of people in need since the start of the conflict,"" the report said.

It recorded government forces using cluster munitions on a displacement camp, an indiscriminate rocket attack on a market and Russian airstrikes destroying a civilian home -- all with multiple fatalities.

The Damascus government, other civil war factions, the international community and the United Nations itself hindered the delivery of urgent assistance to the quake-hit northwest, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said.

They failed to secure an immediate pause in hostilities, or to facilitate life-saving aid through any available route, including for rescue teams in the crucial first week following the February 6 quake, the commission said.

The panel, which investigates and records all international human rights law violations since March 2011 in the country, said they were now probing fresh attacks since the February 6 quake -- which they branded incomprehensible.

""Syrians felt abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" the independent three-member panel said in a statement, calling for a separate investigation into these failings.

President Bashar al-Assad's government took a week to consent to cross-border aid access, said the commission, with member Hanny Megally arguing that international aid should have gone in first, even if it meant skirting around state sovereignty.

- 15.3 million need aid -

Almost 6,000 people were killed in Syria by the 7.8-magnitude tremor that struck the country and neighbouring Turkey.

The UN estimates that five million people need basic shelter and non-food assistance in the quake-hit part of Syria.

Commission chair Paulo Pinheiro said Syria became an ""epicentre of neglect"", adding that the panel was probing multiple allegations of warring factions ""deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid"".

He slammed the ""wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the UN, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need"".

""Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" he added.

Megally said the shelling resumed within two or three days of the quake, and has continued since.

The Syrian conflict started in 2011 with Assad's brutal repression of peaceful protests, and escalated to pull in multiple foreign powers and global jihadists.

Nearly half a million people have been killed, and the conflict has forced around half of Syria's pre-war population from their homes.

- War crime allegations -

The commission issued its latest report Monday, covering violations committed in the second half of 2022.

""More than 13 million people are displaced or refugees at a time when 90 percent of all Syrian civilians live in poverty, and 15.3 million are estimated to require humanitarian assistance to survive -- the highest level of people in need since the start of the conflict,"" the report said.

It recorded government forces using cluster munitions on a displacement camp, an indiscriminate rocket attack on a market and Russian airstrikes destroying a civilian home -- all with multiple fatalities.

""These atrocities continue a long-established pattern of indiscriminate attacks, which may amount to war crimes,"" the commission said.

The report said that the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast were still unlawfully holding 56,000 people in camps, mainly women and children, with suspected links to the Islamic State jihadist group.

( Rasid Necati Aslim - Anadolu Agency )

Parties to the Syrian conflict prevented access to areas affected by the Feb. 5 earthquakes, the UN Syria Commission of Inquiry said on Monday.

In the months leading up to the region's devastating earthquakes, parties to the conflict in Syria ""widely violated and abused human rights,"" continuing a 10-year pattern of disregard for the safety of Syrian citizens, the commission said in a briefing in Geneva, where they launched their latest report on the country's crisis.

""In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, it took the Syrian Government a full week to consent to life-saving cross-border aid access,"" the commission of three stressed.

The Syrian regime and opposition ""both impeded cross-line aid to affected communities, while (al-Qaeda-linked) Hayat Tahrir al Sham in northwestern Syria refused cross-line aid from Damascus,"" according to the commission.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission.

""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe. Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" Pinheiro said.

Commissioner Hanny Megally, for his part, said they are currently investigating several allegations of parties to the conflict deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid to the affected communities, and added: ""As aid is now finally increasing, it is more important than ever that they consent to impartial humanitarian relief being delivered unimpeded to those in need, whether through cross-border or cross-line modalities.""

Regarding the restricted rights of women and girls by the armed groups in the earthquake-affected areas, Lynn Welchman, the commissioner of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, said they have regularly restricted the rights of women and girls.

""Today, most of those without shelter in these areas are girls and women, many of them heading households, and the scaling up of aid must consider the gendered impact of the crisis,"" Welchman added.

PKK terror group's Syria extension holds 56,000 people 'unlawfully'

According to the report, the SDF -- PKK terror group's extension in northern Syria -- ""continues to unlawfully hold 56,000 people, mainly women and children, with suspected family links to Da'esh fighters in Al-Hawl and Roj camps, where conditions continue to deteriorate.""

""The Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that the suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity, and calls for repatriations to speed up,"" it added.

The commission's report, written prior to the devastating quakes, gives a rundown of the wrongdoings against people in Syria. On March 21, it will deliver its findings to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

In its almost 40-year terror campaign against Türkiye, the PKK - listed as a terrorist organization by Türkiye, the US, and the EU - has been responsible for the deaths of over 40,000 people, including women, children, and infants.

The Feb. 6 earthquakes, centered in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras, affected more than 13 million people across 11 provinces, including Hatay, Adana, Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Adiyaman, Malatya, Kilis, Osmaniye, Elazig, and Sanliurfa.

Several countries in the region, including Syria and Lebanon, also felt the strong tremors that struck Türkiye in fewer than 10 hours.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War',

The international community and the Syrian government did not act quickly last month to help people in need in the rebel-held northwest after a deadly earthquake hit Turkiye and Syria, a U.N. commission said Monday.

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkiye and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow.

It added that war-torn Syria now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

It took a week for the U.N. and Syria's President Bashar Assad's government to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkiye as many people were still under the rubble.

Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves, commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva.

He added that we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake, Pinheiro said.

Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria which became the epicentre of neglect.

A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkiye to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims.

They failed to secure an immediate pause in hostilities, or to facilitate life-saving aid through any available route, including for rescue teams in the crucial first week following the February 6 quake, the commission said.

The panel, which investigates and records all international human rights law violations since March 2011 in the country, said they were now probing fresh attacks since the February 6 quake -- which they branded incomprehensible.

""Syrians felt abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" the independent three-member panel said in a statement, calling for a separate investigation into these failings.

President Bashar al-Assad's government took a week to consent to cross-border aid access, said the commission, with member Hanny Megally arguing that international aid should have gone in first, even if it meant skirting around state sovereignty.

Almost 6,000 people were killed in Syria by the 7.8-magnitude tremor that struck the country and neighbouring Turkey.

The UN estimates that five million people need basic shelter and non-food assistance in the quake-hit part of Syria.

Commission chair Paulo Pinheiro said Syria became an ""epicentre of neglect"", adding that the panel was probing multiple allegations of warring factions ""deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid"".

He slammed the ""wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the UN, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need"".

""Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" he added.

Megally said the shelling resumed within two or three days of the quake, and has continued since.

The Syrian conflict started in 2011 with Assad's brutal repression of peaceful protests, and escalated to pull in multiple foreign powers and global jihadists.

Nearly half a million people have been killed, and the conflict has forced around half of Syria's pre-war population from their homes.

The commission issued its latest report Monday, covering violations committed in the second half of 2022.

""More than 13 million people are displaced or refugees at a time when 90 percent of all Syrian civilians live in poverty, and 15.3 million are estimated to require humanitarian assistance to survive -- the highest level of people in need since the start of the conflict,"" the report said.

It recorded government forces using cluster munitions on a displacement camp, an indiscriminate rocket attack on a market and Russian airstrikes destroying a civilian home -- all with multiple fatalities.

""These atrocities continue a long-established pattern of indiscriminate attacks, which may amount to war crimes,"" the commission said.

The report said that the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast were still unlawfully holding 56,000 people in camps, mainly women and children, with suspected links to the Islamic State jihadist group.

""The commission has reasonable grounds to believe that the suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity, and calls for repatriations to speed up.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International human rights law'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Civil war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Independence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bashar al-Assad'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereign state'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nonviolent resistance'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_munition', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cluster munition'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Democratic_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Democratic Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Jihadism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Internally displaced person'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'War crime'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Poverty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}]",,eng-8471915,-0.3490196078431372,416421840,1,terradaily.com,news,Terra Daily,United Nations Syria International community International human rights law Civil war Independence Damascus Bashar al-Assad Aid Earthquake Sovereign state Humanitarian aid Turkey Nonviolent resistance Cluster munition Syrian Civil War Syrian Democratic Forces Airstrike Jihadism Islamic State Internally displaced person War crime Poverty Refugee Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,44,16,2023-03-13

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ''now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected'' for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

The commission also said there have been new attacks in Syria, including a reported Israeli airstrike last week on the international airport of the northern city of Aleppo putting it out of service for three days. The airport has been a main point for aid flowing into Syria and flights were diverted to two other airports when it was closed.

The commission is made up of outside, independent experts who have been working under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council since nearly the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.

It took a week for the U.N. and the government of Syria's President Bashar Assad to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.

''Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,'' commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva. He added that ''we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

''Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,'' Pinheiro said. ''Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria which became the epicenter of neglect.''

A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims. Before that, the U.N. had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

''They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,'' Pinheiro said, adding that ''Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who (are) supposed to protect them in their most desperate time.''

''Many voices are rightly calling ... for an investigation and accountability to understand how this failure, this disaster happened beyond the earthquake,'' Pinheiro said.

Commissioner Hanny Megally said ''it's a shame that all the actors really involved have not been helping in this area and it is difficult of course without proper investigation to say who's most responsible.''

The commission called on nations who have nationals held in the camps of al-Hol and Roj in northeast Syria to speed up the repatriation process. It said conditions are deteriorating at the camps that are housing some 56,000 mostly women and children linked to the Islamic State group.

''The suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity. We call again for repatriations to speed up,'' the commission's report said.

At the fenced camp of al-Hol, there are some 50,000 Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are the wives and widows of IS fighters. In a separate, heavily guarded section of al-Hol known as the annex are an additional 2,000 women from 57 other countries -- they are considered the most die-hard IS supporters -- along with their children, numbering about 8,000.

Some countries, including France, Spain, Russia and Iraq repatriated some of their citizens in recent months but many other countries still refuse.

''Health care is very limited, education is very limited and some of those children have no life apart from these awful conditions,'' said commissioner Lynn Welchman. ''These camps are horrendous places.''",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Switzerland'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bashar al-Assad'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International airport'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ceasefire'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Independent'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_(Syria)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Council of Ministers (Syria)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Syria'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Human Rights Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlib', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Repatriation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Health care'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'War crime'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Iraq'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iraq'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'France'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'France'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Spain'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Spain'}}}]",https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1678309349,eng-8471915,0.03529411764705892,416421900,1,startribune.com,news,Star Tribune,Earthquake United Nations Turkey Syria International community Geneva Bashar al-Assad International airport Airstrike Ceasefire The Independent Humanitarian aid Aleppo Israel Council of Ministers (Syria) President of Syria Syrian Civil War United Nations Human Rights Council Idlib Repatriation Islamic State Health care War crime Russia Iraq France Spain,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,45,16,2023-03-13

Parties to the Syrian conflict prevented access to areas affected by the Feb. 5 earthquakes, the UN Syria Commission of Inquiry said on Monday.

In the months leading up to the region's devastating earthquakes, parties to the conflict in Syria ""widely violated and abused human rights,"" continuing a 10-year pattern of disregard for the safety of Syrian citizens, the commission said in a briefing in Geneva, where they launched their latest report on the country's crisis.

""In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, it took the Syrian Government a full week to consent to life-saving cross-border aid access,"" the commission of three stressed.

The Syrian regime and opposition ""both impeded cross-line aid to affected communities, while (al-Qaeda-linked) Hayat Tahrir al Sham in northwestern Syria refused cross-line aid from Damascus,"" according to the commission.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission.

""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe. Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" Pinheiro said.

Commissioner Hanny Megally, for his part, said they are currently investigating several allegations of parties to the conflict deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid to the affected communities, and added: ""As aid is now finally increasing, it is more important than ever that they consent to impartial humanitarian relief being delivered unimpeded to those in need, whether through cross-border or cross-line modalities.""

Regarding the restricted rights of women and girls by the armed groups in the earthquake-affected areas, Lynn Welchman, the commissioner of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, said they have regularly restricted the rights of women and girls.

""Today, most of those without shelter in these areas are girls and women, many of them heading households, and the scaling up of aid must consider the gendered impact of the crisis,"" Welchman added.

PKK terror group's Syria extension holds 56,000 people 'unlawfully'

According to the report, the SDF -- PKK terror group's extension in northern Syria -- ""continues to unlawfully hold 56,000 people, mainly women and children, with suspected family links to Da'esh fighters in Al-Hawl and Roj camps, where conditions continue to deteriorate.""

""The Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that the suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity, and calls for repatriations to speed up,"" it added.

The commission's report, written prior to the devastating quakes, gives a rundown of the wrongdoings against people in Syria. On March 21, it will deliver its findings to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.â€¨

In its almost 40-year terror campaign against TÃ¼rkiye, the PKK â€"" listed as a terrorist organization by TÃ¼rkiye, the US, and the EU â€"" has been responsible for the deaths of over 40,000 people, including women, children, and infants.

The Feb. 6 earthquakes, centered in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras, affected more than 13 million people across 11 provinces, including Hatay, Adana, Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Adiyaman, Malatya, Kilis, Osmaniye, Elazig, and Sanliurfa.

Several countries in the region, including Syria and Lebanon, also felt the strong tremors that struck TÃ¼rkiye in fewer than 10 hours. -",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War',

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

The international community and the Syrian government did not act quickly last month to help people in need in the rebel-held northwest after a deadly earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, a U.N. commission said Monday.

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

UNITED NATIONS OFFICIAL SAYS THE SYRIAN DEATH TOLL FROM EARTHQUAKE IS LIKELY TO RISE

It took a week for the U.N. and Syria's President Bashar Assad's government to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva. He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

""Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said. ""Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria which became the epicenter of neglect.""

INITIAL EARTHQUAKE AID DELAYS BLAMED ON SYRIA'S ASSAD, WARRING FACTIONS AND BUREAUCRACY

A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims. Before that, the U.N. had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

""They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said, adding that ""Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who (are) supposed to protect them in their most desperate time.""

The United Nations, the Syrian government and other actors are responsible for delays in getting emergency aid to Syrians after last month's earthquake, a UN-appointed commission of inquiry said on Monday, describing the failures as ""shocking"" and calling for a separate investigation.

The allegations add to a growing chorus of criticism of the global body for its role in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that killed some 6,000 people in Syria, mostly in the rebel-held northwest near the Turkish border.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the Government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission.

The parties involved also failed to agree on a pause in hostilities and to allow life-saving aid through any available route, leaving Syrians feeling ""abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" it said.

""The Syrian population has a right to the truth - why they received this treatment,"" Pinheiro added at a later press conference. Of the delays in UN aid, another member of the three-person commission, Hanny Megally, told Reuters: ""You don't wait for permission to act in an emergency and that was what was shocking for us.""

Even when aid did begin flowing, days after the Feb. 6 quake, he said it was a backlog of food and other supplies and not the bulldozers and cranes needed to lift the debris or the medical equipment that could have treated the crush injuries of the rescued.

Syria's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A UN humanitarian office (OCHA) spokesperson said 720 trucks loaded with aid has so far arrived in northwest Syria using three border crossings. He confirmed that no heavy equipment was sent in, saying this was the type of aid that only national authorities can provide.

Syria's government says humanitarian aid should go via territory under its control, although supplies to the northwest are allowed across the border from neighboring Turkey under a UN Security Council agreement.

Last month's earthquake added to misery for people suffering from the consequences of 12 years of civil war, with more than 4 million people reliant on aid before it struck.

The independent commission was established to investigate violations by all parties to the conflict. Commission member Lynn Welchman also said on Monday that the body planned to follow-up on an Israeli air strike that knocked Aleppo airport off service, forcing aid flights to be rerouted.","[{'uri': 'reuters@haaretz.com', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'The Independent'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Egypt'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Egypt'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Brazil'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Brazil'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_truth', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Right to truth'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria–Turkey_border', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria–Turkey border'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldozer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bulldozer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Independent politician'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Civil war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Reuters'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Associated Press'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}]","https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/00000186-db7c-db98-a9f7-ff7f76a20000/3f/db/ac3016f741e6a4ec11127038d367/85710.jpg?precrop=2400,1395,x0,y105&height=630&width=1200",eng-8471915,-0.3490196078431372,416425020,1,haaretz.com,news,haaretz.com,The Independent United Nations Syria Earthquake United Kingdom Egypt Brazil Right to truth Syria–Turkey border International community Bulldozer Airstrike United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Independent politician Civil war United Nations Security Council Humanitarian aid Reuters Associated Press Aleppo Turkey Israel,Israel,IL,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C9,C1,Asia,AS,Jewish,33.0,124.0,49.0,22.0,83.0,15.0,17.0,33.0,19.0,12.0,6.0,26.0,96.0,13.0,54.0,47.0,81.0,38.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,37,17,2023-03-13

Parties to the conflict in Syria committed widespread human rights violations and abuses in the months leading up to the most devastating earthquakes to hit the region in more than a century, continuing a decade-long pattern of failures to protect Syrian civilians, the UN Syria Commission of Inquiry said Monday after launching their latest report on the country's crisis.

The response to the recent massive earthquakes was characterised by additional failures that hindered the delivery of urgent and life-saving aid to northwest Syria. These failures implicated the Government and other parties to the conflict as well as the international community and the United Nations. They failed to secure agreement on an immediate pause in hostilities. They failed to allow and facilitate life-saving aid through any available route, including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake. Syrians felt abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them in the most desperate of times. Many voices are rightly calling for an investigation and for accountability.

Today, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria launched its latest report just ahead of the 12th anniversary of the Syrian crisis, documenting ongoing violations of human rights and humanitarian law throughout the country in the last six months of 2022, including the particularly appalling situation for Syrians along frontlines in the north and northwest.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the Government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, Chair of the Commission. ""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe. Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" he added. These include last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid.

In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, it took the Syrian Government a full week to consent to life-saving cross-border aid access. The Government and the opposition Syrian National Army (SNA) both impeded cross-line aid to affected communities, while Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) in northwest Syria refused cross-line aid from Damascus.

""We are currently investigating several allegations of parties to the conflict deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid to the affected communities,"" said Commissioner Hanny Megally. ""As aid is now finally increasing, it is more important than ever that they consent to impartial humanitarian relief being delivered unimpeded to those in need, whether through cross-border or cross-line modalities,"" he added.

Entire communities have been destroyed, with the UN estimating that some five million people require basic shelter and non-food assistance in the Syrian part of the earthquake zone. Already before the 6 February earthquakes, over 15 million Syrians - more than at any point since the start of the conflict - needed humanitarian assistance.

The Commission will present its report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday, 21 March.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Human rights'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International humanitarian law'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_National_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian National Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_al-Sham', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Tahrir al-Sham'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International airport'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Human Rights Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ceasefire'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Switzerland'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}]",https://anfenglishmobile.com/uploads/en/articles/2023/03/20230313-20230313-809b4869a5d585a5e0aabe92c3290fbe4375c7b481b7b7d05fe3f481bcbe2d72-jpg-webp8f8fb9-image-jpg3fdedc-image.jpg,eng-8471915,-0.2705882352941177,416425320,1,anfenglishmobile.com,news,ANF News,Earthquake International community United Nations Syria Syrian Civil War Human rights International humanitarian law Humanitarian aid Syrian National Army Tahrir al-Sham International airport United Nations Human Rights Council Ceasefire Geneva Damascus Aleppo Israel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,42,17,2023-03-13

Humanitarian assessments point to more than 7,000 people killed in Syria by the natural disaster.

At a press conference in Geneva, chairperson of the inquiry, Paulo Pinheiro, backed calls for a probe into alleged delays in getting aid and rescue equipment to those affected.

The people of Syria had ""a right to the truth"", the veteran rights experts insisted, adding that it was also in the interests of ""international good practice"", so that mistakes could be identified and avoided in future.

""They have the right to know what exactly happened for not receiving (help) immediately,"" he said, adding that Syrian people in the affected areas remained ""completely appalled by this incapacity of the international organizations to come to their support and aid"" because three days after the disaster ""a lot of people could survive if there was a fast, immediate reaction of the international community and the United Nations"".

According to the Commission of Inquiry's latest report into the Syrian crisis, parties to the 12-year-old conflict continued to commit ""widespread human rights violations and abuses"" in the months leading up to the earthquake tragedy.

Hostilities even continued in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the Commissioners said, ""even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes. These include last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid.""

Highlighting the delays in securing international aid access from Türkiye to the stricken northwest, the Commission of Inquiry report noted that the Syrian Government required ""a full week to consent to life-saving cross-border aid access"".

Cross-line aid deliveries were also ""impeded"" by the Government and the opposition Syrian National Army (SNA), the independent investigators said, adding that the non-state armed group Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) in northwest Syria also ""refused cross-line aid from Damascus"".

With entire communities in Syria's northwest destroyed by last month's ""exceptional"" disaster, Commissioner Hanny Megally explained how they had pleaded for assistance.

""People were saying, 'We need heavy equipment, we need search teams with dogs, people are still alive under the rubble. Where's the UN, where's the international community to help us?' And they could see not far away the same earthquake, lots of international assistance being provided on the Turkish side of the border whereas they're all waiting for something that did not transpire.""

It's estimate that five million people require basic shelter and non-food assistance in the Syrian part of the earthquake zone.

Already before the 6 February earthquakes, more than 15 million Syrians - more than at any point since the start of the conflict - needed humanitarian assistance.

Although there were ""many acts of heroism amid the suffering"" after the earthquake, Commissioner Paulo Pinheiro insisted that the Syrian people ""in the most dire need"" had been failed by their Government, the international community and the UN.

Headline: Earthquake in Syria: the UN Commission of Inquiry denounces the obstacles to international aid

According to the three UN investigators, ""the response to the recent massive earthquakes has been characterized by additional failures which have hampered the delivery of urgent and life-saving aid to northwestern Syria"".

These failures have implicated the government and other parties to the conflict, as well as the international community and the United Nations. The Commission criticizes the various actors for having failed to secure a ceasefire which would have facilitated the delivery of aid during the first week following the disaster. According to UN investigators, Syrians felt abandoned and neglected by those who were supposed to protect them, in their most desperate moments.

""Many voices are rightly raised to demand that an investigation be carried out and that those responsible be held accountable. Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, so that civilians - including aid workers - are safe"", said Paulo Pinheiro, President of the Commission.

Entire communities have been destroyed and the United Nations estimates that some five million people need basic shelter and non-food assistance in the Syrian part of the earthquake-affected area. Even before the February 6 earthquakes, more than 15 million Syrians - more than ever since the start of the conflict - were in need of humanitarian aid.

""Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of the parties to the conflict, we are now investigating new attacks, even in areas devastated by earthquakes,"" Pinheiro added. These include the Israeli attack reported last week on Aleppo International Airport, a crossing point for humanitarian aid.

Furthermore, investigators denounced the fact that immediately after the earthquake, it took a whole week for the Syrian government to consent to cross-border access of vital aid. Both the government and the Syrian National Army (ANS) have blocked cross-border aid to affected communities, while Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) in northwestern Syria has refused cross-border aid from Damascus. .

""We are currently investigating several allegations that parties to the conflict deliberately obstructed humanitarian assistance to affected communities,"" said one of the three commissioners, Hanny Megally.

More broadly, the Commission's report, prepared before the devastating earthquakes, provides a summary of violations and abuses committed against civilians in Syria.

Generally speaking, parties to the conflict in Syria committed widespread human rights violations and abuses in the months leading up to the region's most devastating earthquakes in more than a century. century, continuing a decade-long pattern of failures to protect Syrian civilians.

In government-controlled areas, the Commission found growing insecurity in Dara'a, Suwayda' and Hama, as well as continued arbitrary imprisonment, torture, ill-treatment and enforced disappearances.

In the northwest of the country, civilians living in earthquake-affected areas have been particularly exposed to deadly attacks in previous months. In November, in a single indiscriminate attack, government forces used cluster munitions to strike densely populated displacement camps in Idlib governorate, killing 7 civilians and injuring at least 60 others.

In August, another indiscriminate attack killed 16 civilians and injured 29 in and around a busy market in Al-Bab, northeast of Aleppo. ""These atrocities are part of a well-established pattern of indiscriminate attacks, which may constitute war crimes,"" insisted the Commission of Inquiry.

In the northeast, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) continue to illegally detain 56,000 people, mostly women and children, suspected of having family ties to Daesh fighters, in the camps of Al -Hawl and Roj, where conditions continue to deteriorate. ""The Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that the suffering inflicted on these people can be assimilated to the war crime of undermining the dignity of the person, and calls for the repatriations to be accelerated"". The Commission will present its report to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday 21 March in Geneva.

The Commission of Inquiry on Syria pointed to ""failures that hindered the delivery of urgent and lifesaving aid"" to the largely opposition-held northwest region, in the days after the 6 February quakes.

Humanitarian assessments point to more than 7,000 people killed in Syria by the natural disaster.

At a press conference in Geneva, chairperson of the inquiry, Paulo Pinheiro, backed calls for a probe into alleged delays in getting aid and rescue equipment to those affected.

The people of Syria had ""a right to the truth"", the veteran rights experts insisted, adding that it was also in the interests of ""international good practice"", so that mistakes could be identified and avoided in future.

""They have the right to know what exactly happened for not receiving (help) immediately,"" he said, adding that Syrian people in the affected areas remained ""completely appalled by this incapacity of the international organizations to come to their support and aid"" because three days after the disaster ""a lot of people could survive if there was a fast, immediate reaction of the international community and the United Nations"".

According to the Commission of Inquiry's latest report into the Syrian crisis, parties to the 12-year-old conflict continued to commit ""widespread human rights violations and abuses"" in the months leading up to the earthquake tragedy.

Hostilities even continued in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the Commissioners said, ""even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes. These include last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid.""

Highlighting the delays in securing international aid access from Türkiye to the stricken northwest, the Commission of Inquiry report noted that the Syrian Government required ""a full week to consent to life-saving cross-border aid access"".

Cross-line aid deliveries were also ""impeded"" by the Government and the opposition Syrian National Army (SNA), the independent investigators said, adding that the non-state armed group Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) in northwest Syria also ""refused cross-line aid from Damascus"".

With entire communities in Syria's northwest destroyed by last month's ""exceptional"" disaster, Commissioner Hanny Megally explained how they had pleaded for assistance.

""People were saying, 'We need heavy equipment, we need search teams with dogs, people are still alive under the rubble. Where's the UN, where's the international community to help us?' And they could see not far away the same earthquake, lots of international assistance being provided on the Turkish side of the border whereas they're all waiting for something that did not transpire.""

It's estimate that five million people require basic shelter and non-food assistance in the Syrian part of the earthquake zone.

Already before the 6 February earthquakes, more than 15 million Syrians - more than at any point since the start of the conflict - needed humanitarian assistance.

Although there were ""many acts of heroism amid the suffering"" after the earthquake, Commissioner Paulo Pinheiro insisted that the Syrian people ""in the most dire need"" had been failed by their Government, the international community and the UN.

Grandi, who concluded a five-day visit to earthquake-devastated areas, said in a statement Monday, ""The needs on the ground in both countries are enormous and the response must be better resourced.""

He said the focus needs to be not just on long-term rebuilding projects, but on immediate assistance.

""While it is critical to think about and support longer term efforts, much more humanitarian aid and early recovery resources are needed so that people can begin to rebuild their lives and livelihoods,"" he said.

""The level of destruction and devastation is shocking and in many places, it is apocalyptic,"" Grandi added.

Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Monday that the death toll in Turkey had risen to 48,448.

Speaking at a news conference in the hard-hit province of Malatya, Soylu said the toll in Turkey included 6,660 foreign nationals, mostly Syrians. He also said authorities were still trying to identify 1,615 victims.

In neighboring Syria, the quake killed more than 6,000 people.

A U.N. commission Monday blamed both Syria's government and the international community for not acting fast enough to help people in need in Syria's rebel-held northwest.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic said there should be an investigation into why it took a week following the earthquake for Syria's government and the United Nations to agree on opening more border crossings for aid to flow to rebel-held areas.

Commission member Paulo Pinheiro told a news conference in Geneva that there was a ""complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe,"" he said, before adding that the Commission of Inquiry was now investigating fresh attacks ""including last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid"".",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Human Rights Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_National_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian National Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrians', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrians'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International organization'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Human rights'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_al-Sham', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Tahrir al-Sham'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International airport'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ceasefire'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Independence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}]",https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png,eng-8471915,-0.2549019607843137,416431200,1,urdupoint.com,news,UrduPoint,Earthquake United Nations Syria International community United Nations Human Rights Council Pakistan Syrian National Army Syrian Civil War Syrians Aid International organization Human rights Humanitarian aid Tahrir al-Sham International airport Ceasefire Independence Damascus Aleppo Turkey Israel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,20,19,2023-03-13

The commission also said that the response to the recent massive earthquakes that struck the country was characterized by the failures of the Syrian government and international community to secure the delivery of urgent and life-saving aid to the northwest part of the country.

The commission highlighted that parties to the Syrian conflict, including the UN, failed to reach an agreement on an immediate cessation of hostilities and the facilitation of humanitarian aid through any available route in the critical first week following the earthquake.

""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians -- including aid workers -- to be safe. Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission, said.

Pinheiro cited last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo International Airport, which serves as a conduit for humanitarian aid.

""We are currently investigating several allegations of parties to the conflict deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid to the affected communities,"" said Commissioner Hanny Megally.

""As aid is now finally increasing, it is more important than ever that they consent to impartial humanitarian relief being delivered unimpeded to those in need, whether through cross-border or cross-line modalities,"" he added.

Entire communities have been destroyed, with the UN estimating that some five million people require basic shelter and non-food assistance in the Syrian part of the earthquake zone. Already before the Feb. 6 earthquakes, over 15 million Syrians -- more than at any point since the start of the conflict -- needed humanitarian assistance.

In government-controlled areas, the report documented rising insecurity in Dara'a, Suwayda and Hama, as well as continued arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment, and enforced disappearances. Seizures, auctions, and restrictions on access to property were examples of property rights violations.

Civilians in the earthquake-affected northwest have been particularly vulnerable to deadly attacks in recent months.

Government forces used cluster munitions to strike densely populated displacement camps in Idlib governorate inside the opposition-held area in November, killing seven civilians and injuring at least 60 more.

Furthermore, the commission discovered that conditions for safe and dignified return are still lacking. During the reporting period, some Syrians were denied return outright, while others were arbitrarily arrested or barred from returning to government-controlled areas.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ceasefire'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Independent'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Human rights'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'London'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'London'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_International_Airport', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo International Airport'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_arrest_and_detention', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Arbitrary arrest and detention'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_munition', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cluster munition'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Strike action'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Torture'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-Suwayda', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'As-Suwayda'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'As-Suwayda'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daraa', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Daraa'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Daraa'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Hama'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Hama'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlib_Governorate', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib Governorate'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib Governorate'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}]",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2023/03/13/3723451-104552813.jpg?itok=y90IMqTp,eng-8471915,-0.192156862745098,416431320,1,arabnews.com,news,Arab News,Earthquake Humanitarian aid United Nations Syria Ceasefire Syrian Civil War The Independent International community Human rights London Aleppo International Airport Israel Arbitrary arrest and detention Cluster munition Strike action Torture As-Suwayda Daraa Hama Idlib Governorate,Saudi-Arabia,SA,,,Center,ChatGPT,C15,C9,Asia,AS,Muslim,79.0,98.0,163.0,82.0,105.0,56.0,43.0,54.0,55.0,75.0,56.0,64.0,138.0,72.0,48.0,43.0,64.0,27.0,14.0,,,,,Arab League,AL,Arabic-speaking,Ara,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,22,19,2023-03-13

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

The commission also said there have been new attacks in Syria, including a reported Israeli airstrike last week on the international airport of the northern city of Aleppo putting it out of service for three days. The airport has been a main point for aid flowing into Syria and flights were diverted to two other airports when it was closed.

The commission is made up of outside, independent experts who have been working under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council since nearly the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.

It took a week for the U.N. and the government of Syria's President Bashar Assad to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva. He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including the United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

""Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said. ""Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria which became the epicenter of neglect.""

A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims. Before that, the U.N. had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

""They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said, adding that ""Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who (are) supposed to protect them in their most desperate time.""

""Many voices are rightly calling ... for an investigation and accountability to understand how this failure, this disaster happened beyond the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said.

Commissioner Hanny Megally said ""it's a shame that all the actors really involved have not been helping in this area and it is difficult of course without proper investigation to say who's most responsible.""

U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the U.N. legal position is that it works under the mandate of the U.N. Security Council, which at the time of the quake only mandated aid deliveries to Syria's northwest through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing.

""The U.N. did everything in its power as quickly as possible to help all of the people in Syria,"" Dujarric told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.

The commission called on nations who have nationals held in the camps of al-Hol and Roj in northeast Syria to speed up the repatriation process. It said conditions are deteriorating at the camps that are housing some 56,000 mostly women and children linked to the Islamic State group.

""The suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity. We call again for repatriations to speed up,"" the commission's report said.

At the fenced camp of al-Hol, there are some 50,000 Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are the wives and widows of IS fighters. In a separate, heavily guarded section of al-Hol known as the annex are an additional 2,000 women from 57 other countries -- they are considered the most die-hard IS supporters -- along with their children, numbering about 8,000.

Some countries, including France, Spain, Russia and Iraq repatriated some of their citizens in recent months but many other countries still refuse.

""Health care is very limited, education is very limited and some of those children have no life apart from these awful conditions,"" said commissioner Lynn Welchman. ""These camps are horrendous places.""

The three-member independent body accuses the Syrian government and other parties to that country's conflict, the international community, and the United Nations of the abandonment of millions of Syrian civilians in dire need.

""Syrians for good reason felt abandoned and neglected by those who were supposed to protect them in the most desperate of their times,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission. ""Many days were lost without any aid to the survivors of the earthquake, which became an epicenter of neglect.""

He said the warring parties failed to agree on an immediate suspension in hostilities in northwest Syria and ""they failed to allow and facilitate life-saving aid to reach the victims through any available route.""

According to the Reuters news agency, Syria's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pinheiro said the commission was investigating fresh attacks, even in areas devastated by the earthquakes, including ""last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid.""

Before the earthquake struck, humanitarian aid was mainly delivered to Idlib in northwest Syria through one crossing point from Turkey. It took the Syrian government in Damascus a full week after the quake to allow two additional border crossings to open for the delivery of lifesaving assistance, including letting in rescue teams and equipment.

Commission member Hanny Megally has accused armed groups of deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid from crossing these lines. At the same time, he said the United Nations and the international community seemed paralyzed during the early stages of the relief effort.

He said they could have acted more quickly in getting desperately needed aid to the victims instead of waiting a week for Damascus to grant access.

""This was an earthquake. It was an exceptional circumstance,"" he said. ""Legal scholars will argue in exceptional circumstances, you can act even if it means crossing boundaries or trampling on state sovereignty, so to speak.""

His colleague, Lynn Welchman, noted that the government of Syria has a duty to allow impartial humanitarian aid to come through without waiting for a Security Council resolution mandating this.

""But because of the dysfunction of the Security Council, it has become impossible to avoid political brinksmanship in the Security Council on this issue, which comes at the expense of civilian lives and welfare,"" she said.

The commission is calling for a full, independent investigation and accountability to understand how this comprehensive failure to support millions of people in dire need could have happened.

The commission has launched its latest report on the Syrian crisis just days before the country enters its 13th year of civil conflict. The report, which was prepared before last month's earthquake, summarizes violations committed against civilians during the second half of last year.

It has documented increasing insecurity in government-controlled areas, with people subjected to arbitrary imprisonment, torture, ill-treatment and enforced disappearances. It reports civilians living in the earthquake-affected northwest were particularly exposed to deadly attacks in the preceding months.

In November, the report found Syrian government forces used cluster munitions, which are prohibited under international law. It said these weapons struck densely populated displacement camps in Idlib, the last remaining rebel stronghold in Syria, killing and injuring 67 people.

The report has documented the killing and maiming of civilians by unguided rockets and airstrikes by Russian forces in August and July in Al-Bab, northeast of Aleppo.

""These and other atrocities we investigated continue a long-established pattern of indiscriminate attacks, which may amount to war crimes,"" said Pinheiro.

The three-member panel deplores the unlawful incarceration by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces of 56,000 people, mainly women and children in Al-Hawl and Roj camps in northeast Syria.

The commission said they are being held in conditions that ""appear to constitute cruel and inhuman treatment"" and in a state of legal limbo. It reports about 10,000 wives and children suspected of being linked to Islamic State militants are kept in separate detention camps.

Pinheiro said, ""The suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity.""

The U.N. investigators are calling on states to speed up the repatriation of their citizens.

They also are calling for the establishment of an independent international body to help search for the whereabouts and fate of thousands of people who have gone missing in this civil war.

They note that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will brief the General Assembly on the issue of missing persons in Syria later this month.

""We hope this will now lead to concrete action on this without further delay,"" said Pinheiro.

The report will be submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Council next week.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri':

The Damascus government, other civil war factions, the international community and the United Nations itself hindered the delivery of urgent assistance to the quake-hit northwest, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said.

They failed to secure an immediate pause in hostilities, or to facilitate life-saving aid through any available route, including for rescue teams in the crucial first week following the February 6 quake, the commission said.

The panel, which investigates and records all international human rights law violations since March 2011 in the country, said they were now probing fresh attacks since the February 6 quake, which they branded incomprehensible.

""Syrians felt abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" the independent three-member panel said in a statement, calling for a separate investigation into these failings.

President Bashar al-Assad's government took a week to consent to cross-border aid access, said the commission, with member Hanny Megally arguing that international aid should have gone in first, even if it meant skirting around state sovereignty.

15.3 Million Need Aid

Almost 6,000 people were killed in Syria by the 7.8-magnitude tremor that struck the country and neighbouring Turkey.

The UN estimates that five million people need basic shelter and non-food assistance in the quake-hit part of Syria.

Commission chair Paulo Pinheiro said Syria became an ""epicentre of neglect"", adding that the panel was probing multiple allegations of warring factions ""deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid"".

He slammed the ""wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the UN, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need"".

""Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" he added.

Megally said the shelling resumed within two or three days of the quake, and has continued since.

The Syrian conflict started in 2011 with Assad's brutal repression of peaceful protests, and escalated to pull in multiple foreign powers and global jihadists.

Nearly half a million people have been killed, and the conflict has forced around half of Syria's pre-war population from their homes.

War Crime Allegations

The commission issued its latest report Monday, covering violations committed in the second half of 2022.

""More than 13 million people are displaced or refugees at a time when 90 percent of all Syrian civilians live in poverty, and 15.3 million are estimated to require humanitarian assistance to survive, the highest level of people in need since the start of the conflict,"" the report said.

It recorded government forces using cluster munitions on a displacement camp, an indiscriminate rocket attack on a market and Russian airstrikes destroying a civilian home, all with multiple fatalities.

""These atrocities continue a long-established pattern of indiscriminate attacks, which may amount to war crimes,"" the commission said.

The report said that the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast were still unlawfully holding 56,000 people in camps, mainly women and children, with suspected links to the Islamic State jihadist group.

""The commission has reasonable grounds to believe that the suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity, and calls for repatriations to speed up.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugees of the Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International human rights law'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Civil war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Independence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bashar al-Assad'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereign state'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_munition', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cluster munition'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Democratic_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Democratic Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Jihadism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Forced displacement'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Internally displaced person'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'War crime'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Poverty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}]",https://english.ahram.org.eg/Media/News/2023/3/13/41_2023-638143440372114070-211.jpg,eng-8471915,-0.3490196078431372,416436600,1,english.ahram.org.eg,news,جريدة الأهرام,United Nations Syria International community Turkey Refugees of the Syrian Civil War International human rights law Civil war Independence Damascus Bashar al-Assad Aid Sovereign state Humanitarian aid Cluster munition Syrian Civil War Syrian Democratic Forces Airstrike Jihadism Forced displacement Islamic State Earthquake Internally displaced person War crime Poverty Refugee Russia,Egypt,EG,Ara-Eng,ara-eng,Uncertain,https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiAl-Ahram,C19,C5,Africa,AF,Muslim,121.0,142.0,160.0,140.0,161.0,86.0,62.0,82.0,136.0,93.0,107.0,105.0,156.0,80.0,37.0,55.0,55.0,42.0,0.0,African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA),AfCFTA,,,African Union,AU,Arabic-speaking,Ara,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,50,20,2023-03-13

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

The commission also said there have been new attacks in Syria, including a reported Israeli airstrike last week on the international airport of the northern city of Aleppo putting it out of service for three days. The airport has been a main point for aid flowing into Syria and flights were diverted to two other airports when it was closed.

The commission is made up of outside, independent experts who have been working under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council since nearly the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.

It took a week for the U.N. and the government of Syria's President Bashar Assad to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva. He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including the United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

""Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said. ""Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria which became the epicenter of neglect.""

A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims. Before that, the U.N. had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

""They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said, adding that ""Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who [are] supposed to protect them in their most desperate time.""

""Many voices are rightly calling ... for an investigation and accountability to understand how this failure, this disaster happened beyond the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said.

Commissioner Hanny Megally said ""it's a shame that all the actors really involved have not been helping in this area and it is difficult of course without proper investigation to say who's most responsible.""

U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the U.N. legal position is that it works under the mandate of the U.N. Security Council, which at the time of the quake only mandated aid deliveries to Syria's northwest through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing.

""The U.N. did everything in its power as quickly as possible to help all of the people in Syria,"" Dujarric told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.

The commission called on nations who have nationals held in the camps of al-Hol and Roj in northeast Syria to speed up the repatriation process. It said conditions are deteriorating at the camps that are housing some 56,000 mostly women and children linked to the Islamic State group.

""The suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity. We call again for repatriations to speed up,"" the commission's report said.

At the fenced camp of al-Hol, there are some 50,000 Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are the wives and widows of IS fighters. In a separate, heavily guarded section of al-Hol known as the annex are an additional 2,000 women from 57 other countries -- they are considered the most die-hard IS supporters -- along with their children, numbering about 8,000.

Some countries, including France, Spain, Russia and Iraq repatriated some of their citizens in recent months but many other countries still refuse.

""Health care is very limited, education is very limited and some of those children have no life apart from these awful conditions,"" said commissioner Lynn Welchman. ""These camps are horrendous places.""

On Monday, a commission of inquiry appointed by the United Nations attributed the delays in delivering emergency aid to Syrians after February's earthquake to the international organization, the Syrian regime, and other parties.

According to Reuters, there is mounting criticism of the United Nations for its handling of the aftermath of last month's earthquake, which claimed the lives of approximately six thousand Syrians, predominantly in areas near the Syrian-Turkish border in northwestern Syria. This criticism coincides with the recent findings from the UN-appointed commission of inquiry.

In a statement, Committee Chairman Paulo Pinheiro expressed that despite some heroic efforts amidst immense suffering, there has been a significant failure on the part of the Syrian regime government and the international community, including the United Nations, to promptly provide essential aid to Syrians in critical need.

Syrians felt let down

The statement further noted that the involved parties could not come to an agreement to cease hostilities and facilitate the passage of life-saving aid through any feasible means, leaving Syrians feeling ""abandoned and neglected by those responsible for safeguarding them during their most trying moments.""

The three-member independent body accuses the Syrian government and other parties to that country's conflict, the international community, and the United Nations of the abandonment of millions of Syrian civilians in dire need.

'Syrians for good reason felt abandoned and neglected by those who were supposed to protect them in the most desperate of their times,' said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission. 'Many days were lost without any aid to the survivors of the earthquake, which became an epicenter of neglect.'

FILE - Paulo Pinheiro, chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria, attends a news conference at the United Nations office in Geneva, Switzerland, Sept. 6, 2017.

He said the warring parties failed to agree on an immediate suspension in hostilities in northwest Syria and 'they failed to allow and facilitate life-saving aid to reach the victims through any available route.'

According to the Reuters news agency, Syria's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pinheiro said the commission was investigating fresh attacks, even in areas devastated by the earthquakes, including 'last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid.'

Before the earthquake struck, humanitarian aid was mainly delivered to Idlib in northwest Syria through one crossing point from Turkey. It took the Syrian government in Damascus a full week after the quake to allow two additional border crossings to open for the delivery of lifesaving assistance, including letting in rescue teams and equipment.

Commission member Hanny Megally has accused armed groups of deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid from crossing these lines. At the same time, he said the United Nations and the international community seemed paralyzed during the early stages of the relief effort.

He said they could have acted more quickly in getting desperately needed aid to the victims instead of waiting a week for Damascus to grant access.

FILE - A United Nations aid convoy enters rebel-held northwestern Syria from Turkey through the Bab el-Hawa crossing on Feb. 9, 2023, the first since a devastating earthquake February 6 that killed thousands.

'This was an earthquake. It was an exceptional circumstance,' he said. 'Legal scholars will argue in exceptional circumstances, you can act even if it means crossing boundaries or trampling on state sovereignty, so to speak.'

His colleague, Lynn Welchman, noted that the government of Syria has a duty to allow impartial humanitarian aid to come through without waiting for a Security Council resolution mandating this.

'But because of the dysfunction of the Security Council, it has become impossible to avoid political brinksmanship in the Security Council on this issue, which comes at the expense of civilian lives and welfare,' she said.

The commission is calling for a full, independent investigation and accountability to understand how this comprehensive failure to support millions of people in dire need could have happened.

The commission has launched its latest report on the Syrian crisis just days before the country enters its 13th year of civil conflict. The report, which was prepared before last month's earthquake, summarizes violations committed against civilians during the second half of last year.

It has documented increasing insecurity in government-controlled areas, with people subjected to arbitrary imprisonment, torture, ill-treatment and enforced disappearances. It reports civilians living in the earthquake-affected northwest were particularly exposed to deadly attacks in the preceding months.

In November, the report found Syrian government forces used cluster munitions, which are prohibited under international law. It said these weapons struck densely populated displacement camps in Idlib, the last remaining rebel stronghold in Syria, killing and injuring 67 people.

The report has documented the killing and maiming of civilians by unguided rockets and airstrikes by Russian forces in August and July in Al-Bab, northeast of Aleppo.

'These and other atrocities we investigated continue a long-established pattern of indiscriminate attacks, which may amount to war crimes,' said Pinheiro.

The three-member panel deplores the unlawful incarceration by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces of 56,000 people, mainly women and children in Al-Hawl and Roj camps in northeast Syria.

The commission said they are being held in conditions that 'appear to constitute cruel and inhuman treatment' and in a state of legal limbo. It reports about 10,000 wives and children suspected of being linked to Islamic State militants are kept in separate detention camps.

Pinheiro said, 'The suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity.'

The U.N. investigators are calling on states to speed up the repatriation of their citizens.

They also are calling for the establishment of an independent international body to help search for the whereabouts and fate of thousands of people who have gone missing in this civil war.

They note that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will brief the General Assembly on the issue of missing persons in Syria later this month.

'We hope this will now lead to concrete action on this without further delay,' said Pinheiro.

The report will be submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Council next week.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri':

The report, issued on 13 March, comes days ahead of the 12 anniversary of the Syrian war that began with protests and a Salafist-led insurgency.

In a press release announcing the report, the UNCIS also criticized the parties to the conflict for their response to the devastating earthquake which struck Turkiye and Syria in February, killing some 50,000 across both countries.

The press release stated that ""The response to the recent massive earthquakes was characterized by additional failures that hindered the delivery of urgent and life-saving aid to northwest Syria. These failures implicated the Government and other parties to the conflict as well as the international community and the United Nations. They failed to secure an agreement on an immediate pause in hostilities. They failed to allow and facilitate life-saving aid through any available route, including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake ... Many voices are rightly calling for an investigation and for accountability.""

The other parties to the conflict mentioned in the press release include Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), formerly known as the Nusra Front, an offshoot of Al-Qaeda. HTS is led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a former deputy of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi.

On 12 February, a UN spokesman told the media that HTS was preventing a SARC humanitarian aid convoy at the Saraqib border crossing from entering Idlib. The Saraqib crossing is the link between HTS-held Idlib and the territories held by Damascus.

That day, an HTS source was quoted as saying that the group ""won't allow the regime to take advantage of the situation to show they are helping,"" despite Damascus having openly announced its intention to provide aid to all areas of Syria. The following day, HTS leader Julani claimed, ""There is no need to dispatch our technical teams to bring aid in from regime territory ... The Bab al-Hawa crossing [from Turkiye] is there.""

The roads leading to the Bab al-Hawa crossing from Turkiye were badly damaged in the earthquake, however, making use of the crossing was difficult.

Paulo Pinheiro, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry, stated in the press release today that ""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe. Incomprehensibly, due to the cruelty and cynicism of parties to the conflict, we are now investigating fresh attacks even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes,"" he added. The statement noted that this included ""last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid.""

Israeli jets bombed Aleppo airport in the early hours of 7 March, killing three, damaging the runway, and forcing aid deliveries to be redirected to Latakia and Damascus airports. Previous to the Israeli airstrikes, over 80 humanitarian flights had landed at Aleppo airport, according to a transport ministry official who spoke with AFP.

In the days following the earthquake, Israeli officials warned that Tel Aviv would ""not hesitate"" to bomb Iranian aid deliveries for disaster-struck Syria under claims that Tehran seeks to ""take advantage of the tragic situation ... to send weapons and equipment to Hezbollah.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_al-Sham', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Tahrir

(AP)

The international community and the Syrian government did not act quickly last month to help people in need in the opposition-held northwest after a deadly earthquake hit Türkiye and Syria, a UN commission said Monday.

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Türkiye and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

It took a week for the UN and Syria's President Bashar Assad's government to agree on opening two more border crossings into the opposition-held region bordering Türkiye as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva.

He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

""Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said. ""Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria which became the epicenter of neglect.""

A week after the earthquake, the UN announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Türkiye to the country's opposition-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims.

Before that, the UN had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

""They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said, adding that ""Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who (are) supposed to protect them in their most desperate time.""

""Many voices are rightly calling ... for an investigation and accountability to understand how this failure, this disaster happened beyond the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said.","[{'uri': 'asharq_al_awsat@english.aawsat.com', 'name': 'Asharq Al Awsat', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson_of_the_African_Union_Commission', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chairperson of the African Union Commission'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Headquarters of the United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Human Rights Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Human rights'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Switzerland'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Brazil'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Brazil'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bashar al-Assad'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ceasefire'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'The Independent'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Syria'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Associated Press'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlib_Governorate', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib Governorate'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib Governorate'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}]",https://english.aawsat.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2023/03/13/_switzerland_un_syria_84979-7d247-1678721444.jpg?itok=-4-zt8sh,eng-8471915,0.223529411764706,416450700,1,english.aawsat.com,news,Asharq Al-Awsat English,United Nations Syria Earthquake Chairperson of the African Union Commission Headquarters of the United Nations United Nations Human Rights Council International community Human rights Geneva Brazil Bashar al-Assad Ceasefire The Independent Humanitarian aid President of Syria Associated Press Idlib Governorate Russia,United-Kingdom,UK,,,,,C4,C2,Europe,EU,Christian,12.0,21.0,17.0,15.0,15.0,10.0,10.0,12.0,15.0,9.0,34.0,14.0,22.0,35.0,89.0,66.0,35.0,51.0,69.0,,,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,45,0,2023-03-14

The UN Commission of Inquiry highlighted on Monday NGOs and foreign governments' slow response to the crisis, as well as the UN's own failings.

More than 45,000 people were killed in Turkey and about 6,000 in Syria after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Turkey last month. Roads between the two countries were buckled and many were impassable.

Survivors at the Bab Al Hawa border crossing posted images on social media of families passing through the area by car, and an absence of aid deliveries.

The UN commission highlighted how Damascus waited a week before allowing further border crossings to open, delaying vital aid and recovery efforts.

The independent three-member commission also said Syria had conducted air and artillery attacks in northern Syria after the disaster, and said armed rebel groups had also obstructed aid.

""Syrians felt abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" the commission said in a statement.

Bab Al Hawa was agreed on as the only border crossing that can be used to send aid to rebel-held northern Syria, after Russia vetoed the opening of more crossing points, until eventually opening four border entry points.

Moscow said that deliveries of aid across the border to rebel-held areas, including Idlib which is controlled by militants formerly linked to Al Qaeda, would be a violation of Syria's sovereignty.

The commission's Hanny Megally said aid organisations should have moved more quickly, regardless of Syria's sovereignty considerations.

The UN estimates that five million people need basic shelter and non-food assistance in the quake-hit parts of Syria.

Commission chair Paulo Pinheiro said Syria became an ""epicentre of neglect"" and the panel was probing multiple allegations of warring factions ""deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid"".

He slammed the ""wholesale failure by the government and the international community, including the UN, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need"".",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Moment magnitude scale'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Non-governmental organization'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Independence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Artillery'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Social media'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereignty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Moscow'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Moscow'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlib', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}]",https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/i7_itwc_CYQV-cOfdQq40F4fjZA=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thenational/P6OFASI6E4BFK5QO2ZAFOIUV3I.jpg,eng-8471915,-0.2705882352941177,416464380,1,thenationalnews.com,news,The National,Earthquake United Nations Syria Turkey Moment magnitude scale Non-governmental organization International community Humanitarian aid Independence Artillery Social media Damascus Al-Qaeda Sovereignty Moscow Idlib Russia,United-Arab-Emirates,AE,English,eng,Pro-government,https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiThe_National_(Abu_Dhabi),C19,C9,Asia,AS,Muslim,44.0,50.0,146.0,38.0,78.0,32.0,22.0,22.0,26.0,47.0,33.0,42.0,119.0,74.0,36.0,52.0,66.0,22.0,22.0,?,?,?,?,Arab League,AL,Arabic-speaking,Ara,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,33,4,2023-03-14

The international community and the Syrian government did not act quickly enough last month to help people in need in the rebel-held northwest after a deadly earthquake hit Turkey and conflict-ravaged Syria, a UN-backed commission said Monday.

The February 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

The commission also said there have been new attacks in Syria, including a reported Israeli airstrike last week on the international airport of the northern city of Aleppo putting it out of service for three days. The airport has been a main point for aid flowing into Syria and flights were diverted to two other airports when it was closed.

The commission is made up of outside, independent experts who have been working under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council since nearly the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.

It took a week for the UN and the government of Syria's President Bashar Assad to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva. He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

""Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said. ""Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria which became the epicenter of neglect.""

A week after the earthquake, the UN announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims. Before that, the UN had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

""They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said, adding that ""Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who (are) supposed to protect them in their most desperate time.""

""Many voices are rightly calling ... for an investigation and accountability to understand how this failure, this disaster happened beyond the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said.

Commissioner Hanny Megally said ""it's a shame that all the actors really involved have not been helping in this area and it is difficult of course without proper investigation to say who's most responsible.""

The commission called on nations who have nationals held in the camps of al-Hol and Roj in northeast Syria to speed up the repatriation process. It said conditions are deteriorating at the camps that are housing some 56,000 mostly women and children linked to the Islamic State group.

""The suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity. We call again for repatriations to speed up,"" the commission's report said.

At the fenced camp of al-Hol, there are some 50,000 Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are the wives and widows of IS fighters. In a separate, heavily guarded section of al-Hol known as the annex are an additional 2,000 women from 57 other countries - they are considered the most die-hard IS supporters - along with their children, numbering about 8,000.

Some countries, including France, Spain, Russia and Iraq repatriated some of their citizens in recent months but many other countries still refuse.

""Health care is very limited, education is very limited and some of those children have no life apart from these awful conditions,"" said commissioner Lynn Welchman. ""These camps are horrendous places.""","[{'uri': 'associated_press@english.elpais.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bashar al-Assad'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International airport'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ceasefire'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Independent'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_(Syria)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Council of Ministers (Syria)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Syria'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Human Rights Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Switzerland'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Repatriation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Health care'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'War crime'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlib', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Iraq'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iraq'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'France'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'France'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Spain'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Spain'}}}]",https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/kT1nsfMa8mb8kEfya1ntNLd8Rm0=/1200x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/WMDTL4IHWC2M3CZY5ZJIWIUMXQ.jpg,eng-8471915,0.06666666666666665,416477760,1,english.elpais.com,news,EL PAÍS English Edition,Earthquake United Nations Turkey Syria International community Bashar al-Assad International airport Airstrike Ceasefire The Independent Humanitarian aid Aleppo Israel Council of Ministers (Syria) President of Syria Syrian Civil War United Nations Human Rights Council Geneva Repatriation Islamic State Health care War crime Idlib Russia Iraq France Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,16,8,2023-03-14

The allegations add to a growing chorus of criticism of the global body for its role in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that killed some 6,000 people in Syria, mostly in the opposition-held northwest near the Turkish border.

""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the Government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Pinheir.

The parties involved have also failed to agree on an immediate suspension in hostilities in northwest Syria and to allow life-saving aid through any available route.

""Syrians for good reason felt abandoned and neglected by those who were supposed to protect them in the most desperate of their times"" he added.

""The Syrian population has a right to the truth - why they received this treatment,"" Pinheiro added at a later press conference.

Of the delays in UN aid, another member of the three-person commission, Hanny Megally, told Reuters: ""You don't wait for permission to act in an emergency and that was what was shocking for us.""

Even when aid did begin flowing, days after the 6 February quakes, he said it was a backlog of food and other supplies and not the bulldozers and cranes needed to lift the debris or the medical equipment that could have treated the crush injuries of the rescued.

Syria's Ministry of Information did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A UN humanitarian office (OCHA) spokesperson said 720 trucks loaded with aid have so far arrived in northwest Syria using three border crossings. He confirmed that no heavy equipment was sent in, saying this was the type of aid that only national authorities can provide.

Syria's government says humanitarian aid should go via territory under its control, although supplies to the northwest are allowed across the border from neighbouring Turkeiye under a UN Security Council agreement.

The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

The commission also said there have been new attacks in Syria, including a reported Israeli airstrike last week on the international airport of the northern city of Aleppo that put it out of service for three days. The airport has been a main point for aid flowing into Syria, and flights were diverted to two other airports when it was closed.

The commission is made up of outside, independent experts who have been working under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council since nearly the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.

It took a week for the U.N. and the government of Syria's President Bashar Assad to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva. He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""

""Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said. ""Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria, which became the epicenter of neglect.""

A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims. Before that, the U.N. had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

""They failed to deliver international emergency support, including rescue teams and equipment, in the vital first week after the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said.

Commissioner Hanny Megally said ""it's a shame that all the actors really involved have not been helping in this area and it is difficult of course without proper investigation to say who's most responsible.""

U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the U.N. legal position is that it works under the mandate of the U.N. Security Council, which at the time of the quake only mandated aid deliveries to Syria's northwest through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing.

The commission called on nations who have nationals held in the camps of al-Hol and Roj in northeast Syria to speed up the repatriation process. It said conditions are deteriorating at the camps that are housing some 56,000 mostly women and children linked to the Islamic State group.

""The suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity. We call again for repatriations to speed up,"" the commission's report said.

The three-member independent body accuses the Syrian government and other parties to that country's conflict, the international community, and the United Nations of the abandonment of millions of Syrian civilians in dire need.

""Syrians for good reason felt abandoned and neglected by those who were supposed to protect them in the most desperate of their times,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission. ""Many days were lost without any aid to the survivors of the earthquake, which became an epicenter of neglect.""

He said the warring parties failed to agree on an immediate suspension in hostilities in northwest Syria and ""they failed to allow and facilitate life-saving aid to reach the victims through any available route.""

According to the Reuters news agency, Syria's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pinheiro said the commission was investigating fresh attacks, even in areas devastated by the earthquakes, including ""last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid.""

Before the earthquake struck, humanitarian aid was mainly delivered to Idlib in northwest Syria through one crossing point from Turkey. It took the Syrian government in Damascus a full week after the quake to allow two additional border crossings to open for the delivery of lifesaving assistance, including letting in rescue teams and equipment.

Commission member Hanny Megally has accused armed groups of deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid from crossing these lines. At the same time, he said the United Nations and the international community seemed paralyzed during the early stages of the relief effort.

He said they could have acted more quickly in getting desperately needed aid to the victims instead of waiting a week for Damascus to grant access.

""This was an earthquake. It was an exceptional circumstance,"" he said. ""Legal scholars will argue in exceptional circumstances, you can act even if it means crossing boundaries or trampling on state sovereignty, so to speak.""

His colleague, Lynn Welchman, noted that the government of Syria has a duty to allow impartial humanitarian aid to come through without waiting for a Security Council resolution mandating this.

""But because of the dysfunction of the Security Council, it has become impossible to avoid political brinksmanship in the Security Council on this issue, which comes at the expense of civilian lives and welfare,"" she said.

The commission is calling for a full, independent investigation and accountability to understand how this comprehensive failure to support millions of people in dire need could have happened.

The commission has launched its latest report on the Syrian crisis just days before the country enters its 13th year of civil conflict. The report, which was prepared before last month's earthquake, summarizes violations committed against civilians during the second half of last year.

It has documented increasing insecurity in government-controlled areas, with people subjected to arbitrary imprisonment, torture, ill-treatment and enforced disappearances. It reports civilians living in the earthquake-affected northwest were particularly exposed to deadly attacks in the preceding months.

In November, the report found Syrian government forces used cluster munitions, which are prohibited under international law. It said these weapons struck densely populated displacement camps in Idlib, the last remaining rebel stronghold in Syria, killing and injuring 67 people.

The report has documented the killing and maiming of civilians by unguided rockets and airstrikes by Russian forces in August and July in Al-Bab, northeast of Aleppo.

""These and other atrocities we investigated continue a long-established pattern of indiscriminate attacks, which may amount to war crimes,"" said Pinheiro.

The three-member panel deplores the unlawful incarceration by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces of 56,000 people, mainly women and children in Al-Hawl and Roj camps in northeast Syria.

The commission said they are being held in conditions that ""appear to constitute cruel and inhuman treatment"" and in a state of legal limbo. It reports about 10,000 wives and children suspected of being linked to Islamic State militants are kept in separate detention camps.

Pinheiro said, ""The suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity.""

The U.N. investigators are calling on states to speed up the repatriation of their citizens.

They also are calling for the establishment of an independent international body to help search for the whereabouts and fate of thousands of people who have gone missing in this civil war.

They note that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will brief the General Assembly on the issue of missing persons in Syria later this month.

""We hope this will now lead to concrete action on this without further delay,"" said Pinheiro.

Conflict has brought with it economic destitution, the destruction of basic services and infrastructure, and more recently the first cholera outbreak in Syria in thirteen years.

Over a month since a massive earthquake struck Türkiye and Syria, the devastating scale of crisis upon crisis inside Syria has come into sharp relief. In the northwest of Syria, over 4,500 have lost their lives, thousands have become homeless, and further damage has been wreaked on services, infrastructure, homes, and livelihoods already decimated by a decade of violence.

Even before this latest tragedy, some 15.3 million people -- 70 per cent of the country's population -- needed humanitarian assistance. Despite this, 2022 saw the largest funding gap for the Syria Humanitarian Response Plan since the conflict began, with only 49% of needs funded last year and more than $2.2 billion funding needs unmet.

As well as a lack of funding, humanitarian access to the northwest of the country, the area worst affected by the earthquake and where more than 4 million people were already reliant on cross-border assistance, remains a concern. A week after the initial earthquake the UN Emergency Relief Chief secured an agreement to open two new crossings to the UN for a period of 3 months. These were in addition to the one crossing at Bab al Hawa already authorized for UN use by the UN Security Council. Since the two additional crossings were opened more than 600 UN trucks have crossed Turkiye-Syria border. However, with the scale of needs still astronomical and both modalities set to expire by July unless renewed, the need to ensure both secure and predictable assistance for at least another 12 months remains imperative.

As Syria marks yet another year of conflict and worsening crisis, the IRC is calling on the international community to:

● Ensure that the UN Flash Appeals for Syria and Turkiye, set up after the earthquake and calling for $397 million and $1 billion respectively, are fully funded when donor's meet at the International Donors' Conference for the people in Türkiye and Syria in Brussels on 20th March.

● Sufficiently fund the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan, recognising both the increasingly severe immediate needs that must be addressed, as well as the supporting early recovery and sustainable medium-term interventions.

● Ensure that the UN Security Council reauthorizes the provisions of the cross-border Resolution 2672 for a minimum of 12 months in July 2023 to avoid a major worsening of the humanitarian situation, while also expanding all other viable routes to those in need of humanitarian assistance.

● Prioritise the protection of civilians, humanitarian actors and civilian infrastructure by reaffirming the importance of adherence to international humanitarian law and strengthening efforts to hold perpetrators of IHL violations in Syria to account.

Tanya Evans, the IRC's Country Director in Syria, said:

""Another year and we are once again confronted with a record number of people in need inside Syria. Yet despite both needs and vulnerabilities continuing to grow, funding is again failing to keep pace. This year's Syria Humanitarian Response Plan (2023 HRP) is the largest humanitarian appeal worldwide, requiring $4.8 billion to address just the needs that already existed before last month's devastating earthquakes. While the vast sums reflect both the scale and gravity of the situation for ordinary families across Syria, today the 2023 HRP is only 5% funded.""

""Our teams and partners in the northwest, some of the first to respond to the earthquake, continue to respond to the devastating situation lived daily by families who have now endured more than 12 years of conflict. Among the many lessons that the ongoing earthquake response continues to highlight is the imperative for the international community to show genuine solidarity with humanitarian actors by ensuring their access to additional, appropriate, and flexible funding.""

David Miliband, President and CEO of the IRC said:

""Syrians in the country and refugees beyond its border have paid a heavy price for the loss of attention by the international community. The earthquake in February was a reminder that a forgotten crisis is not a resolved crisis. It exposed the graphic truth about life for those left stranded by the war: they are at the mercy of events, trapped by circumstance and vulnerable to shocks.

""The difficulties getting life-saving aid into northwest Syria at speed and scale following last month's massive earthquake once again demonstrates the need for sustained, predictable and unfettered humanitarian access to millions of Syrians who have now lived through 12 years of conflict, as well as a once-in-a-century natural disaster. A recent agreement to open to the UN two additional border crossing points in the northwest has significantly helped aid efforts at a time of immense need. But with this agreement set to expire in May, and the UN Security Council's Cross-Border Mechanism also due to expire shortly after in July, the threat to cross-border operations once again looms large. If anything, the last month has been proof positive that cross-border aid remains the only viable means to ensure those in need in the northwest are not left behind.

""The humanitarian track needs energy and funding. Limbo is no lifestyle for millions in the Northwest. Survival is success in the wake of the earthquake, but it represents no vision for the future. For that we need recovery that deals with the realities on the ground. Bombing raids have not re-established rule from Damascus, and families need to rebuild their lives and to break free from the cycle of poverty and suffering. That takes recovery of infrastructure and services, helping sustainably improve the lives of millions of ordinary Syrians in the months ahead.""

The EU Arabic Spokesperson for the Middle East and North Africa stated that the European Union, which shows its commitment to the Syrian people by providing emergency relief, will not accept the marginalization of the political process in Syria.

Luis Miguel Bueno told Enab Baladi in an email about the mechanism for distributing European aid in Syria that the EU's political position is that there is no possibility of normalization before the Syrian regime engages in a political transition process and fully implements Security Council Resolution No. 2254.

The EU sanctions imposed on Syria target the ""Assad regime"" and its supporters, as well as sectors of the economy from which the regime profits, Bueno said.

It also does not prohibit the export of food, medicine, or medical equipment by the European Union to Syria and does not target the healthcare system, and the sanctions regime includes a broad humanitarian exemption to ensure the continued provision of humanitarian assistance to any affected area in Syria, he added.

The spokesman stressed that the European Union has mobilized emergency and humanitarian tools to help the Syrians wherever they are, whether in areas controlled by the regime or in northwestern Syria and that European aid is based on needs, not on political considerations or considerations of any kind.

The spokesman also indicated that the European Union is cooperating with its partners in the humanitarian field to assess the level of damage and needs in all affected areas, calling on the ""partners"" to quickly adjust their grants to respond to the earthquake.

The European Union was involved in the humanitarian response process in Syria for those affected by the earthquake that struck the Turkish state of Kahramanmaraş and also affected four Syrian governorates on February 6, leaving tens of thousands of victims.

Since the earthquake rocked the northwestern region, aid planes have been flowing into Syria from ""friendly"" countries that have diplomatic relations with the Syrian regime and others that provided relief support within the framework of the humanitarian response, and the EU aid falls within this framework.

Six steps with two axes

The European Union activated six steps to deliver aid to Syria days after the earthquake.

It included the establishment of two axes, available by air and sea, to provide aid to the Syrians, one in Beirut, to reach areas controlled by the regime and the other in Gaziantep, Turkey.

According to the spokesman, tons of aid (tents, generators, heaters, and food) were delivered to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which delivered the aid to the northwest, where it is distributed to the needy.

This aid is received by EU staff, who coordinate the arrival before the aid continues to Syria.

After aid reaches Syria, the EU's humanitarian partners distribute the materials received directly to people, and identify the most vulnerable people to provide them with aid, says the spokesperson.

Under the six steps, the European Union's civil protection mechanism was activated, and 15 European countries provided aid, including tents, beds, blankets, heaters, hygiene supplies, generators, food, medical supplies, and more.

The aid was delivered to the most needy people in the areas controlled by the regime and in the northwest, according to the European spokesperson, who at the same time questioned the validity of the perceptions that the bulk of the aid goes to the regime-controlled areas.

Needs, not political or religious considerations

On the aid distribution mechanism, the spokesman said that the European Union is doing everything it can to take sufficient guarantees for the arrival of aid provided through the civil protection mechanism.

He referred to the experience of partner organizations and their possession of systems in place to ensure that aid reaches those in need.

The European Commission also monitors EU-funded humanitarian projects through audits and evaluations and also participates in the regional dialogue mechanism, during which procurement is constantly reviewed.

The European Union had to find a solution for how to deliver aid to the regime-controlled areas and northwestern Syria, and in addition to the offers of European countries, it activated the stock of European capacity for humanitarian response in Dubai and Brindisi.

Luis Miguel Bueno - The EU Spokesperson

Two planes carrying emergency aid landed in Damascus on February 26, and they are part of a series of planes transporting aid from European Union stocks to the Syrian people in various Syrian regions.

The European Union cooperates with a group of partners in the humanitarian field in Syria, including the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Aid is always based on needs, not on political, religious, or any other considerations, the EU spokesperson emphasized.

In addition to its humanitarian aid, the European Union constantly renews its call for a political solution to the conflict in Syria under the auspices of the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, which the Union fully supports, according to Bueno.

Temporary exemptions

On February 23, the European Union issued a six-month amendment, including exemptions to the sanctions it imposes on the regime.

According to the amendment, the need for humanitarian organizations to obtain prior permission from the competent national authorities in member states to transfer or provide goods and services intended for humanitarian purposes to Syrian persons and entities on the EU sanctions lists was waived.

The EU justified this step at the time, by facilitating the rapid delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria, given the seriousness of the humanitarian crisis, which was exacerbated by the earthquake, according to the press release published on the European Union's official website at the time.

The Syrian regime also demanded the activation of the civil protection mechanism in the European Union, which is what actually happened, as the Union activated this mechanism as one of the six steps it took to deliver aid to Syria after the earthquake, which included supporting humanitarian partners on the ground, activating the protection mechanism and the European humanitarian response capacity, establishing two axes to provide aid, coordinating with partners in the humanitarian field to reach the Syrians, and distributing aid to the people who deserve it.

Since the Feb.6 earthquake, the Syrian regime has tended to exploit the catastrophe politically by linking the aid file to its demand to lift the sanctions imposed by the EU and the US as a result of cracking down peaceful protests and its security repression since the revolution erupted in 2011.

The devastating earthquake resulted in the death of 1,414 people in regime-controlled areas and 2,274 people in the northwestern region that hosts more than 3.5 million people, between residents and internally displaced persons, who mainly suffer from a lack of aid and harsh living conditions.","[{'uri': 'enab12_m_h@english.enabbaladi.net', 'name': 'Enab12 M.H', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency':

The protesters likely never dreamed that their peaceful demonstrations could descend into a civil war that would rage for more than a decade.

A U.K.-based monitoring group says it has documented more than 503,000 lives claimed in the conflict, including more than 162,000 civilians. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes, and an estimated 15 million are now relying on humanitarian assistance.

The Syrians who survived the rise and fall of ISIS, ground battles, shelling, air raids and explosions of the complex war -- in which Russia backs their government and the U.S. and its allies have supported rebel forces -- then had to contend with the coronavirus pandemic.

The unending disasters kept many families moving from place to place in search of safety, especially in the war-torn north, where some cities have been reduced to rubble by their own government forces and Russia's.

Then, on February 6, survivors already exhausted and vulnerable from the war were dealt another blow when huge earthquakes rocked the region.

In the space of a single day, without any warning, thousands of Syrians once again found themselves homeless. Civilian aid groups say 250,000 people were newly displaced by the earthquakes, and they are still stuck in more than 1,800 makeshift camps and shelters in the northern provinces of Idlib and Aleppo.

Northern Syria was already crippled from the war, and with much of the ground still held by rebel forces, search and rescue operations after the quakes fell solely on the White Helmets, a volunteer civil defense organization that operates across northern Syria.

""More than 40,000 families have lost their homes and need us to heal their wounds and give them support,"" White Helmets Director Raed Al-Saleh told CBS News.

Unequipped to deal with a disaster of this magnitude, the group quickly turned to the international community for help, but its leaders say they were neglected by the world.

The United Nations has come under significant criticism over the response, and Al-Saleh said the global body should accept some of the blame ""from rescue workers who lost their nails while trying to save those trapped under the rubble and from families of victims grieving for their children.""

The U.N. has accepted that it took too long to get help into northern Syria. Those delays were due in large part to the ongoing war. It took U.N. officials and others a week to convince the Assad regime to open two additional border crossings into the rebel-held north. Only one had been in operation when the quakes struck. Opposition factions have also been accused of hindering the flow of aid, including by stealing it and then selling it on the black market.

In a report published Monday, an independent U.N.-backed commission acknowledged ""a complete failure by the government and the international community including the United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria"" after the earthquakes, with one of the commissioners, Paul Pinheiro, noting that ""many days were lost without any aid to survivors.""

Pinheiro said northwest Syria had become an ""epicenter of neglect.""

The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria called for a formal investigation into why it took so long to get the additional border crossings open -- and for a ""comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" to allow aid work to continue and civilians to live in safety.

Far from a cease-fire, however, the earthquakes may have prolonged the Syrian peoples' suffering on account of the war. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a U.K.-based monitoring organization that's relied on a network of contacts inside the country to report on the war for years, claimed Tuesday that Iran's military had taken advantage of the post-quake chaos to smuggle advanced weapons into Syria.

The detailed SOHR report could not be independently verified by CBS News, but Iran backs some of the militias operating in northern Syria, close to the Turkish border, which have battled government forces and other rebel groups in recent years.

The earthquakes claimed some 50,000 lives in Turkey and at least 6,000 more in Syria. But in Syria the temblors compounded what was already a miserable existence for hundreds of thousands of people, many of them now stuck in the frigid displacement camps.

""Syria was not in ruins only because it was struck by a massive earthquake. Syria has been under the rubble for 12 years, since the world turned a blind eye to the Assad regime and Russia dropping barrel bombs, carrying out air strikes and dropping chemical weapons on residential neighborhoods,"" the White Helmets' Al-Saleh told CBS News.

After the slow start, aid has flowed into northern Syria, with the U.N. saying last week that more than 600 trucks carrying emergency humanitarian goods from eight of the global body's agencies had entered since the earthquakes struck.

The director of the White Helmets acknowledged ""a noticeable improvement"" in support from the U.N., but he stressed that humanitarian needs were still mounting fast due to quake-damaged infrastructure and the persistent lack of necessities in the makeshift camps.

Aid workers warned recently that the lack of basic hygiene and fresh water in the camps had allowed a cholera outbreak to spread, with at least 22 people confirmed dead from the disease since late last year.

Vaccination efforts have also ramped up, with health officials in Idlib province claiming to have administered more than half a million doses as of this week.

""This earthquake was the largest natural disaster that Syria has seen in decades,"" Al-Saleh told CBS News. ""In the early days the focus was on those trapped under the rubble. But now, a month later, we have to deal with those who are still stuck -- but on top of the rubble.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label':

The protesters likely never dreamed that their peaceful demonstrations could descend into a civil war that would rage for more than a decade.

A U.K.-based monitoring group says it has documented more than 503,000 lives claimed in the conflict, including more than 162,000 civilians. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes, and an estimated 15 million are now relying on humanitarian assistance.

The Syrians who survived the rise and fall of ISIS, ground battles, shelling, air raids and explosions of the complex war -- in which Russia backs their government and the U.S. and its allies have supported rebel forces -- then had to contend with the coronavirus pandemic.

The unending disasters kept many families moving from place to place in search of safety, especially in the war-torn north, where some cities have been reduced to rubble by their own government forces and Russia's.

Then, on February 6, survivors already exhausted and vulnerable from the war were dealt another blow when huge earthquakes rocked the region.

In the space of a single day, without any warning, thousands of Syrians once again found themselves homeless. Civilian aid groups say 250,000 people were newly displaced by the earthquakes, and they are still stuck in more than 1,800 makeshift camps and shelters in the northern provinces of Idlib and Aleppo.

Northern Syria was already crippled from the war, and with much of the ground still held by rebel forces, search and rescue operations after the quakes fell solely on the White Helmets, a volunteer civil defense organization that operates across northern Syria.

""More than 40,000 families have lost their homes and need us to heal their wounds and give them support,"" White Helmets Director Raed Al-Saleh told CBS News.

Unequipped to deal with a disaster of this magnitude, the group quickly turned to the international community for help, but its leaders say they were neglected by the world.

The United Nations has come under significant criticism over the response, and Al-Saleh said the global body should accept some of the blame ""from rescue workers who lost their nails while trying to save those trapped under the rubble and from families of victims grieving for their children.""

The U.N. has accepted that it took too long to get help into northern Syria. Those delays were due in large part to the ongoing war. It took U.N. officials and others a week to convince the Assad regime to open two additional border crossings into the rebel-held north. Only one had been in operation when the quakes struck. Opposition factions have also been accused of hindering the flow of aid, including by stealing it and then selling it on the black market.

In a report published Monday, an independent U.N.-backed commission acknowledged ""a complete failure by the government and the international community including the United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria"" after the earthquakes, with one of the commissioners, Paul Pinheiro, noting that ""many days were lost without any aid to survivors.""

Pinheiro said northwest Syria had become an ""epicenter of neglect.""

The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria called for a formal investigation into why it took so long to get the additional border crossings open -- and for a ""comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" to allow aid work to continue and civilians to live in safety.

Far from a cease-fire, however, the earthquakes may have prolonged the Syrian peoples' suffering on account of the war. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a U.K.-based monitoring organization that's relied on a network of contacts inside the country to report on the war for years, claimed Tuesday that Iran's military had taken advantage of the post-quake chaos to smuggle advanced weapons into Syria.

The detailed SOHR report could not be independently verified by CBS News, but Iran backs some of the militias operating in northern Syria, close to the Turkish border, which have battled government forces and other rebel groups in recent years.

The earthquakes claimed some 50,000 lives in Turkey and at least 6,000 more in Syria. But in Syria the temblors compounded what was already a miserable existence for hundreds of thousands of people, many of them now stuck in the frigid displacement camps.

""Syria was not in ruins only because it was struck by a massive earthquake. Syria has been under the rubble for 12 years, since the world turned a blind eye to the Assad regime and Russia dropping barrel bombs, carrying out air strikes and dropping chemical weapons on residential neighborhoods,"" the White Helmets' Al-Saleh told CBS News.

After the slow start, aid has flowed into northern Syria, with the U.N. saying last week that more than 600 trucks carrying emergency humanitarian goods from eight of the global body's agencies had entered since the earthquakes struck.

The director of the White Helmets acknowledged ""a noticeable improvement"" in support from the U.N., but he stressed that humanitarian needs were still mounting fast due to quake-damaged infrastructure and the persistent lack of necessities in the makeshift camps.

Aid workers warned recently that the lack of basic hygiene and fresh water in the camps had allowed a cholera outbreak to spread, with at least 22 people confirmed dead from the disease since late last year.

Vaccination efforts have also ramped up, with health officials in Idlib province claiming to have administered more than half a million doses as of this week.

""This earthquake was the largest natural disaster that Syria has seen in decades,"" Al-Saleh told CBS News. ""In the early days the focus was on those trapped under the rubble. But now, a month later, we have to deal with those who are still stuck -- but on top of the rubble.""

According to State Department Spokesperson Ned Price, within two days the United States had sent Turkey ""[e]mergency responders, hazardous material technicians, engineers, logisticians, paramedics, and planners, along with 170,000 pounds of specialized tools and equipment."" This immediate aid to Turkey was followed by ""concrete breakers, generators, medical supplies, tents, water, and water purification systems.""

Just across the border in Syria, members of the White Helmets dug out the wounded with shovels and their hands. They did not have enough emergency workers and heavy machinery to pull thousands of people trapped in their collapsed homes.

Syrian president Bashar al-Assad blamed the lack of humanitarian response in Syria on sanctions against his government, particularly U.S. sanctions. The real barriers are more nuanced. Physical access itself proved to be a major obstacle in the first week following the quake, causing the UN to pause its regular aid deliveries because of road damage and logistical challenges. Competing authorities that control various portions of northwest Syria denied each other access to areas under differing control. U.S. sanctions do generally prohibit transactions involving Syria, but broad pre-existing authorizations allow humanitarian assistance-related transactions. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued an additional earthquake relief-related authorization on February 9, 2023.

U.S. export controls implemented by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) pose a more significant barrier to the delivery of rapid emergency assistance beyond the provision of food and basic medicine. As a result, although USAID had provided $50 million in new funding to meet urgent humanitarian needs in northern Syria, those implementing USAID-funded (and other) assistance have encountered delays in bringing equipment to Syria necessary to carry out their work.

Addressing the challenges to Syria earthquake relief requires, first, understanding the physical and political barriers to getting foreign aid into Syria immediately after the earthquake and the efforts made so far to overcome those barriers. From there, we turn to the scope of U.S. sanctions and relevant exceptions. Finally, and most substantially, we describe U.S. restrictions on export or reexport to Syria of any item subject to U.S. export controls, aside from food and certain medicine. We propose a path forward to remove export control obstacles, while still ensuring appropriate monitoring and oversight.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 9 million people in Syria live in earthquake-affected areas. Although primarily under Assad government control, the region of northwest Syria impacted by the earthquake hosts areas under the authority of multiple groups, from Kurdish forces, to Turkish-backed rebel groups, to Islamists.

Areas under Assad government control represent the green area in the CFR map below. Kurdish forces (in dark yellow on the map), under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), control a large swath of northern Syria, primarily to the east of earthquake-affected areas. Turkey, meanwhile, sponsored several groups' push into Kurdish-controlled territory, and Turkish-backed groups now control two separate areas of the northwest region, colored purple in the map, including some of the areas most heavily impacted by earthquake destruction. Finally, an Islamist descendant of al-Qaeda groups fighting in Syria's civil war, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), controls a portion of the far northwest of the country that includes Idlib.

Over the past several years, aid and trade arrived in Syrian opposition-controlled areas through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing between northwest Syria and Turkey, which has represented the only humanitarian aid corridor authorized under UN Security Council Resolution 2165, as most recently extended in January 2023 under UNSCR 2672. Russia and China have previously vetoed the use of any other border crossings for this purpose.

For two days after the earthquake, Bab al-Hawa was closed, because of earthquake damage. And for a week following the earthquake, Assad demanded that all aid go through his government in Damascus, rather than through northern checkpoints with Turkey. HTS, meanwhile, refused Syrian regime offers of aid into its territory, indicating that it would only accept aid via Turkey. Turkey, which had stymied aid from Kurdish-controlled regions of Deir al-Zour, Raqqa, and Manbij into Turkish-controlled regions eventually allowed the assistance a week after the earthquake after delivery trucks removed signs indicating that the aid had originated from the Kurdish-controlled areas. Around the same time, on Feb. 14, the UN announced that Assad had agreed to the opening of two more northern border crossings between Turkey and Syria in opposition controlled-areas: Bab al-Salam and Bab al-Rae'e.

Thus, while some physical barriers and political bottlenecks to the delivery assistance remain, they have eased in the weeks since the earthquake.

Sanctions add additional challenges on top of the physical barriers and geo-political issues. The United States has imposed territory-wide sanctions against Syria and has specifically sanctioned the Syrian regime, terrorist-controlled opposition groups, and various Syrian individuals and companies. Such sanctions can result in compliance challenges for those on the front lines of delivering humanitarian assistance. They also make it harder to transmit funding for aid projects because financial institution de-risking decisions make traditional banking unavailable in-country. This section describes these U.S. sanctions and the broad exemptions for earthquake relief.

In addition to U.S. primary sanctions, memorialized at 31 CFR part 542, which generally prohibit transactions involving Syria, its government, and Syrian petroleum products, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 (""Caesar Act"") provides for the imposition of so-called ""secondary sanctions"" on foreign persons that facilitate activities of the Syrian regime or profit from the Syrian conflict. Under the Caesar Act, even non-Syrian entities are at risk of sanctions designation if they meet its criteria. Additionally, opposition groups in northern Syria like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham are designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists and Foreign Terrorist Organizations, imposing additional sanctions applicable to transactions in areas under their control.

Despite the broad scope of U.S. sanctions, OFAC has issued numerous, expansive general licenses (authorizations on which anyone can rely, so long as they meet all criteria) such that U.S. sanctions should not create a meaningful barrier to humanitarian assistance activities in Syria. In particular, three days after the earthquake, OFAC issued Syria General License 23, which authorizes ""all transactions [with the Government of Syria] related to earthquake relief efforts in Syria that would otherwise be prohibited"" under the Syria Sanctions Regulations. As OFAC clarified in a subsequent Compliance Communiqué, the 180-day license permits, among other things, all fundraising for earthquake relief in Syria. In particular, the license explicitly states that it encompasses ""the processing or transfer of funds on behalf of third-country persons to or from Syria in support of the transactions"" for earthquake relief and authorizes banks to rely on the representations of the funds transfer originator that the transfer meets the terms of GL 23 absent knowledge to the contrary. These provisions should reassure banks that they can and should permit financial transfers for earthquake relief.

Prior to the earthquake relief general license, OFAC had also issued a number of other licenses that served to authorize a range of humanitarian and other foreign assistance activities under the patchwork of sanctions applicable to Syria. For example, as part of a systematic effort to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2664, which carved out humanitarian assistance and other activities that support basic human needs from UN sanctions programs, OFAC issued general licenses across the range of OFAC sanctions programs authorizing otherwise prohibited activities for: (1) the official business of the U.S. government (including by grantees implementing U.S. awards) and (2) international organizations and entities, (3) transactions in support of certain NGO activities, including humanitarian projects to meet basic human needs in Syria, and (4) the provision of agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, and associated parts and software. Additionally, Syria General License 22 broadly authorized transactions in non-regime held areas of northeast and northwest Syria in a variety of economic sectors, including agriculture, power grid infrastructure, construction, water and waste management, and health services.

As a result of these broad and varied sanctions authorizations, while sanctions compliance remains an important element of any Syria assistance program, U.S. sanctions do not create a significant barrier to the implementation of earthquake response efforts.

OFAC's Compliance Communiqué states that General License 23 allows for ""removing rubble from collapsed buildings; stabilizing damaged buildings; stabilizing or repairing roads and other critical infrastructure damaged in the earthquake; remediation of pollution or environmental damage; repairing or rebuilding damaged hospitals and schools in earthquake-affected areas."" But without a license from the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, organizations may be unable to supply the necessary equipment to carry out these activities. BIS controls exports to Syria via the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which describe controls on the export, reexport, or transfer of commercial items that are within the scope of U.S. export jurisdiction.

Although some level of export control applies to every country, the United States imposes the most expansive export controls on Syria, Iran, Cuba, and North Korea. For these countries, U.S. export controls apply to both U.S.-origin items, as well as items exported from other countries that contain just 10 percent U.S.-origin content (generally calculated based on the value of the item and its constituent parts). As a result of this 10 percent content threshold, it is frequently difficult for organizations to avoid U.S. export control jurisdiction, even for items procured from overseas. BIS therefore serves as a gatekeeper for the myriad products, software, and technology necessary to provide disaster response.

A. History: The Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003

Many of the broad controls on U.S. exports to Syria date to the 2003 Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act (Syria Accountability Act). The Syria Accountability Act aimed to compel Syria to comply with various foreign policy goals, from ceasing the provision of support to international terrorist groups, to withdrawing from Lebanon (which it did in 2005), to ceasing missiles and weapons development-related activities, to ending Syrian support for terrorist activities in Iraq. It did so by imposing a range of restrictions on Syria, which apply, unless waived, until a presidential determination that certain criteria are met.

President George W. Bush implemented the Syria Accountability Act through Executive Order 13338 of May 13, 2004, delegating the Section 5(b) waiver authority to the Secretary of State.

B. Syria Export Controls in Practice

The Commerce Department implemented the broad Syria Accountability Act export control prohibitions via the EAR, including a Syria embargo-specific section at 15 CFR § 746.9. As these regulations specify, with limited exception, U.S. export controls prohibit the export of virtually everything other than food and basic medicine - both specifically defined terms - to Syria. (Informational materials such as books and other media, publicly available software and technology, and technology related to patent applications are also allowed because they are not subject to the EAR or its controls.) Export licenses to Syria are ""subject to a general policy of denial"" under § 746.9(c)(1) unless waived under the Syrian Accountability Act waiver authority.

BIS authorizations take the form of specific licenses or license exceptions, which carve out specified activities from licensing requirements. There are only five license exceptions applicable to Syria exports, none of which are particularly helpful for humanitarian disaster relief efforts. They encompass exceptions for news media, U.S. government personnel, limited software exports, personal baggage, and civil aircraft while in transit.

Given the limited nature of applicable license exceptions, assistance organizations must generally apply to BIS for export licenses on a case-by-case basis. BIS only authorizes such specific license for the range of activities authorized under the Section 5(b) waivers. These include the waivers that the president issued in EO 13338 and a June 12, 2013 waiver issued by the Secretary of State. Licensable exports that are most relevant for earthquake relief include:

Thus, the types of equipment that organizations need for aid after the earthquake may conceivably be brought into Syria. However, they require an individual license to do so.

In order to apply for a license, at a high level, an organization must (1) identify each of the products, software, or technology it intends to export, reexport, or transfer to Syria; (2) assess whether they are subject to US export controls; (3) identify the export control classification numbers (ECCNs) for the items subject to US export controls; and (4) prepare and submit a license application to BIS describing the controlled items to be exported, reexported, or transferred, and their use. Absent clear information from a product manufacturer, assessing whether an item is subject to U.S. export controls and then determining that item's ECCN is a time and labor-intensive and technical process. It often involves enlisting the expertise of a third-party consultant or attorney. The application process is time and resource intensive, serving as a barrier to aid organizations' ability to rapidly deliver disaster assistance.

C. Better export licensing

On Feb. 17, 11 days after the earthquake first hit, BIS announced that it would expedite license applications for both Turkey and Syria. It did not provide a time frame or say how long such license applications would take to process. In practice, it appears to be taking a matter of weeks for the U.S. government to review and process each application. While this timeframe is faster than the standard BIS license review process, it is still too slow for a humanitarian crisis. This section outlines options to address these barriers to the provision of lifesaving humanitarian assistance in a timely manner.

More License Exceptions: With response times of critical importance, license exceptions are the best mechanism to allow for the quick delivery of assistance since they allow for the export of items without the need to apply or wait for BIS review. License exceptions have historically been limited in the Syria context due to concerns about diversion to unintended actors and the unpredictable nature of the environment. We therefore do not propose that BIS implement a broad range of license exceptions but rather recommend targeted expansions of the temporary export exception (i.e., license exception TMP) to allow for the time-limited export of disaster relief-related equipment for the earthquake response, as well as future humanitarian response efforts. Such a limited exception lowers risk of diversion but would make a material impact to the ability of aid organizations to carry out their work.

For countries other than Syria, Iran, North Korea, and Cuba the ""tools of the trade"" temporary export exception at 15 CFR 740.9(a)(1) allows for the export of commodities and software for exporters or their employees to use for their work while abroad. This license exception requires that the items remain under ""effective control"" of the exporter or the exporter's employees while in use. If not consumed or destroyed in the normal course of use, items must be returned to the country of origin as soon as possible, and no later than a year after export, or the exporter should apply for a longer-term specific license. This license exception is not currently available in Syria.

Such a license exception for humanitarian aid in Syria would increase aid worker safety and would enable them to carry out their work within the critical window for a humanitarian response. Specifically, it would allow for the immediate export of communication devices and critical earthquake relief tools, such as construction equipment, water pumps, and power supplies at the time of crisis, rather than weeks later. Such items would remain under aid organization control while in-country and be returned following their use, thereby minimizing the risks of unauthorized diversion. In the event an exporter required the use of an item for a longer period, they would have ample time in which to apply for a license, while still retaining the use of the equipment in the meantime.

If a tools of the trade exemption for Syrian humanitarian assistance had been in place at the time of the earthquake, aid organizations could have brought the necessary assistance tools into Syria as soon as the physical access restrictions were resolved. Instead, they must now wait the weeks or months necessary to prepare and then receive a response to a specific export license application.

To the extent the requirements of the ""tools of the trade"" exception are insufficient to account for diversion concerns, the additional parameters of the ""news media"" exception (which does currently apply to Syria) in paragraph (a)(9) of the temporary export exception, provide BIS with potential additional mechanisms of control, without impeding the immediate export of necessary items during a humanitarian crisis. This exception (1) requires those relying on it to email a list of the commodities for export to BIS, specifying the destination and estimated dates of departure and return; (2) allows BIS to check that items are, in fact, returned; and (3) requires that news media organizations retain ""effective control"" of the news-gathering tools in the country of destination. This does not preclude a sub-contractor from using such equipment, as long as the news gathering organization designates an organization employee to be responsible for the equipment. The same processes applied to aid organizations relying on the temporary license exemption would provide BIS with a mechanism to ensure oversight of equipment exported or reexported for disaster response, while allowing for aid organizations and their local implementing partners to export and use disaster relief equipment in Syria without delay.

If U.S. policymakers believe that even further controls are necessary, they might limit the use of a Syria ""tools of the trade"" exception to those implementing U.S. government foreign assistance programs, since such U.S. government implementing partners are not only bound by U.S. export control requirements, but also by the elevated obligations tied to their contract and grant agreements. The U.S. government has already vetted these implementing partners, who have presumably demonstrated their abilities to implement assistance programs consistent with U.S. laws and regulations. The fact that many such U.S. government awardees must now wait to start providing disaster relief in Syria because of the time it takes to apply for and receive U.S. export licenses undermines U.S. government emergency relief activities overall. An alternative approach to achieving this goal would be to authorize an expansion to Syria of the license exception applicable to U.S. government foreign assistance, perhaps in conjunction with written authorization, provided as part of the contract or grant, from the head of the U.S. government department or agency responsible for the assistance program in question. This would allow the U.S. government to decide when to apply the exception on an award-by-award basis. Such parameters, however, would significantly limit the utility of the exception.

The ""support for the Cuban people"" license exception (license exception SCP) provides an additional potential model for the contours of a Syria assistance-related license exception. This license exception generally applies to the export or reexport of items subject to the lowest levels of export control (i.e., those controlled only for anti-terrorism reasons or those designated as EAR99, that is, items that are not controlled in an ECCN described in the Commerce Control List) for specified purposes that are consistent with U.S. foreign policy objectives towards Cuba. The U.S. government could craft a similar license exception to support the Syrian people. Such a license exception might pre-authorize, for example, the export of the categories of items that currently receive a favorable specific license review policy for Syria, as described in the previous section.

Implementation: The foregoing Syria export authorization expansions would be implemented in the same manner as prior changes in Syria export licensing. Namely, the Secretary of State would issue a waiver under section 5(b) of the Syria Accountability Act and report to Congress explaining that these export authorizations are in the national security interest of the United States. Subsequently, BIS would implement the authorizations via changes to the EAR. While too late to address the immediate post-earthquake emergency, such authorizations would still enable the ongoing earthquake response effort, allow for a faster response in the next crisis, and facilitate the longer-term provision of humanitarian assistance.

Additional Steps: Beyond license exceptions, there are several simple steps that BIS could take to facilitate the ability of aid organizations to comply with U.S. export controls. These include: (1) issuing guidance for humanitarian assistance organizations to explain Syria-related (and other) U.S. export controls requirements and exceptions most applicable to humanitarian relief efforts, à la OFAC's Compliance Communiqué; (2) providing public information about and points of contact for emergency export license review timelines and processes; and (3) issuing a list of export control classification numbers for common disaster relief equipment. BIS might build such a list from the export licenses it is currently reviewing for Syria and in consultation with the international NGO community.

***

It is not in the U.S. national security interest for export controls to increase loss of life in Syria by preventing the supply of disaster relief equipment at a time of crisis. When, as here, the news media has authorization to take their equipment to report about the Syrian earthquake, while aid organizations must wait for the review and approval of their case-by-case specific license applications, it is time to change the policy. Done in a considered, thoughtful way, such a policy shift will allow for the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance in response to the Syrian earthquake and future humanitarian crises, without increasing the risks against which U.S. export controls seek to guard.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_Accountability_Act', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng':

For one, the bogus international response reinforced the feeling of Syrians, both in opposition-controlled and government-controlled territory, of not being relevant to this world. The failure to rescue survivors in the north-west, condemning them to certain death, painfully symbolises the inability to bring an end to impunity. In addition, the Assad regime seized this disaster to strengthen its control and further weaponise aid efforts. Meanwhile, donors are attempting to organise a comprehensive response for victims of the quake, with the EU donor conference on 20 March as a landmark event.

In recent years, the lived experiences of Syrians have been largely eclipsed by hegemonic narratives of the conflict prevailing in the Global North. While the 2011 uprising and the regime's ferocious repression initially caught international attention, this interest soon waned and largely disappeared with Daesh's ascendance in 2014. Ever since, the mainstream reading is that of a conflict between the Assad regime and jihadi groups, increasingly making Syrian victims invisible, their experiences and perspectives. The earthquake, the pinnacle of 12 years of disasters, further entrenches the invisiblisation of Syrian experiences of harm.

While the earthquake knows no borders, as Syrians underline, the international response was marked by a clear border. This was prompted by political considerations and dictated by the Assad regime that obstructs relief to north-west Syria. Whereas international teams immediately arrived in Turkiye, the UN failed to mobilise teams to rescue survivors in Idlib province, the area that was struck the hardest, sending the signal that their lives were not worth saving. Additionally, humanitarian aid was barred from entering the first week, as the UN caved in to the regime's dictate to use all but one border crossing, Bab Al-Hawa, to deliver cross-border assistance from Turkiye. The only trucks that entered Syria the first week were those of the corpses of Syrian victims who lived in Turkiye. Syrian novelist, Khaled Khalifa, posits that ""the meagre aid that the world promised did not arrive, and people had nothing but their nails to dig up their loved ones under the rubble."" A week after the quake, the regime cynically agreed to open two additional border crossings for a period of three months.

The regime seizes the quake as an opportunity to entrench its control and further enrich itself. Evidently, it also thwarts relief efforts in areas under its control. Human rights researcher, Sema Nassar, underlines that civilians in Aleppo and Latakia, hit by the quake, organised rescue efforts themselves and faced extortion by militias. Although the international community quickly tried to mobilise rescue teams and stepped up aid to Damascus via UN bodies and the Syrian Red Crescent Organisation, beneficiaries have hardly benefited from these efforts. Aid efforts in Damascus are led by the so-called Higher Relief Committee, which arranges UN requests for humanitarian access with government ministries, controlled by the intelligence forces. This system is kept in place to the benefit of the regime's warehouses. Moreover, international aid has been sold and confiscated by regime-affiliated groups. The quake provides the regime with another opportunity to rob its civilians and to step up the erasure of its crimes. Yasmeen Almashan, member of the Caesar Families Association, stresses that this disaster compounds the crisis of the over 100,000 forcibly disappeared and the missing, as there is a lack of clarity about the casualties and the situation in the prisons, giving the regime the chance to further erase evidence of its crimes there. In addition, it takes advantage of the confusion over the impact of sanctions to plead for them to be lifted. Yet, sanctions do not lie at the origin of the humanitarian crisis: the regime's war against its citizens does.

Faced with the manipulations of the regime and other spoilers, governments in the Global North and the UN will continue navigating this quagmire. The question is whether they have sufficiently fought back to counter those manipulations. The UN recognises it has failed Syrians. To justify this failure, officials allude to a catch-22: the UN wants to live up to the humanitarian imperative, and this involves making compromises. Yet, these compromises have meant that UN bodies have conceded to regime demands resulting in dubitative deals over operational matters, problematic procurement contracts and the recruitment of regime loyalists' relatives. Hence, the UN has given precedence to political over human rights considerations, invoking among others the need for caution. This caution reached an all-time low when the UN waited for eight days for Assad to approve use of the border crossings of Al-Rai and Bab Al-Salama. However, it could have gotten aid in earlier as Turkiye opened these crossings on the third day.

It is undeniable that the UN finds itself between a rock and a hard place in Syria. But what if the catch-22 is not the main cause of the failure to live up to the humanitarian imperative? A group of legal experts argues that UN organisations do not need regime permission, or a mandate from the Security Council to deliver cross-border aid. International humanitarian law requires states to implement, or at least facilitate, the delivery of life-saving aid to those affected. Yet, Syrians were left alone in the face of one of the biggest disasters in decades, while the UN waited for Assad's permission, allowing him to step up the fight against his people.

While the international response utterly failed, Syrian civil society organisations came to the rescue of civilians. Had it not been for their efficiency and determination to rescue survivors, the situation would have been even more disastrous, Yasmeen Almashan stresses. Groups such as The White Helmets epitomised the bravery of Syrian individuals, who had no choice but to become humanitarian workers. Nascent Syrian civil society organisations (CSOs) face extreme challenges as they lack resources and operate in egregious conditions. Maria Al-Abdeh, Director of Women Now for Development highlights that NGO-workers witness extreme harm and have to deal with cynical games between political factions who equally try to make a gain out of the suffering.

READ: 12 years since the start of the Syrian revolution

Despite the extreme conditions, the lack of resources, financial difficulties and being overstretched, Syrian CSOs have been more efficient and ingenious in their rescue and relief efforts than states and UN institutions. This phenomenon is not new. Pursuing justice for Syrians, CSOs have spearheaded initiatives at a time when the international institutional justice mobilisation has declined. In doing so, civil society has generated new initiatives in the fields of documentation, criminal accountability and truth-seeking. While justice efforts might seem far removed from the ongoing relief operations, both are intricately linked as they reveal weaknesses in the international political and humanitarian system and the problematic relations with the Assad regime.

In the run-up to increased international efforts, states and multilateral institutions need to consider how to reinforce their efforts to assist Syrian civilians. In order to remedy some of their blunders, governmental actors need to consider how their policies do no further harm. Firstly, they need to find better ways to protect civilians in the north-west, an area that has been subjected for years to the regime's annihilation policies and that became the football of power games between the regime, jihadi groups and Turkiye. A key aspect to highlight here is the efficiency of Syrian civil society that has proven to be a light in the darkness. Secondly, states need to curb Assad's enthusiasm about turning this disaster into a chance to escalate the war against his people.

For one, the bogus international response reinforced the feeling of Syrians, both in opposition-controlled and government-controlled territory, of not being relevant to this world. The failure to rescue survivors in the north-west, condemning them to certain death, painfully symbolises the inability to bring an end to impunity. In addition, the Assad regime seized this disaster to strengthen its control and further weaponise aid efforts. Meanwhile, donors are attempting to organise a comprehensive response for victims of the quake, with the EU donor conference on 20 March as a landmark event.

Syrians' worldlessness

In recent years, the lived experiences of Syrians have been largely eclipsed by hegemonic narratives of the conflict prevailing in the Global North. While the 2011 uprising and the regime's ferocious repression initially caught international attention, this interest soon waned and largely disappeared with Daesh's ascendance in 2014. Ever since, the mainstream reading is that of a conflict between the Assad regime and jihadi groups, increasingly making Syrian victims invisible, their experiences and perspectives. The earthquake, the pinnacle of 12 years of disasters, further entrenches the invisiblisation of Syrian experiences of harm.

While the earthquake knows no borders, as Syrians underline, the international response was marked by a clear border. This was prompted by political considerations and dictated by the Assad regime that obstructs relief to north-west Syria. Whereas international teams immediately arrived in Turkiye, the UN failed to mobilise teams to rescue survivors in Idlib province, the area that was struck the hardest, sending the signal that their lives were not worth saving. Additionally, humanitarian aid was barred from entering the first week, as the UN caved in to the regime's dictate to use all but one border crossing, Bab Al-Hawa, to deliver cross-border assistance from Turkiye. The only trucks that entered Syria the first week were those of the corpses of Syrian victims who lived in Turkiye. Syrian novelist, Khaled Khalifa, posits that ""the meagre aid that the world promised did not arrive, and people had nothing but their nails to dig up their loved ones under the rubble."" A week after the quake, the regime cynically agreed to open two additional border crossings for a period of three months.

The regime seizes the quake as an opportunity to entrench its control and further enrich itself. Evidently, it also thwarts relief efforts in areas under its control. Human rights researcher, Sema Nassar, underlines that civilians in Aleppo and Latakia, hit by the quake, organised rescue efforts themselves and faced extortion by militias. Although the international community quickly tried to mobilise rescue teams and stepped up aid to Damascus via UN bodies and the Syrian Red Crescent Organisation, beneficiaries have hardly benefited from these efforts. Aid efforts in Damascus are led by the so-called Higher Relief Committee, which arranges UN requests for humanitarian access with government ministries, controlled by the intelligence forces. This system is kept in place to the benefit of the regime's warehouses. Moreover, international aid has been sold and confiscated by regime-affiliated groups. The quake provides the regime with another opportunity to rob its civilians and to step up the erasure of its crimes. Yasmeen Almashan, member of the Caesar Families Association, stresses that this disaster compounds the crisis of the over 100,000 forcibly disappeared and the missing, as there is a lack of clarity about the casualties and the situation in the prisons, giving the regime the chance to further erase evidence of its crimes there. In addition, it takes advantage of the confusion over the impact of sanctions to plead for them to be lifted. Yet, sanctions do not lie at the origin of the humanitarian crisis: the regime's war against its citizens does.

A delusional UN Catch-22?

Faced with the manipulations of the regime and other spoilers, governments in the Global North and the UN will continue navigating this quagmire. The question is whether they have sufficiently fought back to counter those manipulations. The UN recognises it has failed Syrians. To justify this failure, officials allude to a catch-22: the UN wants to live up to the humanitarian imperative, and this involves making compromises. Yet, these compromises have meant that UN bodies have conceded to regime demands resulting in dubitative deals over operational matters, problematic procurement contracts and the recruitment of regime loyalists' relatives. Hence, the UN has given precedence to political over human rights considerations, invoking among others the need for caution. This caution reached an all-time low when the UN waited for eight days for Assad to approve use of the border crossings of Al-Rai and Bab Al-Salama. However, it could have gotten aid in earlier as Turkiye opened these crossings on the third day.

It is undeniable that the UN finds itself between a rock and a hard place in Syria. But what if the catch-22 is not the main cause of the failure to live up to the humanitarian imperative? A group of legal experts argues that UN organisations do not need regime permission, or a mandate from the Security Council to deliver cross-border aid. International humanitarian law requires states to implement, or at least facilitate, the delivery of life-saving aid to those affected. Yet, Syrians were left alone in the face of one of the biggest disasters in decades, while the UN waited for Assad's permission, allowing him to step up the fight against his people.

Syrian CSOs as a Main Rescue Force

While the international response utterly failed, Syrian civil society organisations came to the rescue of civilians. Had it not been for their efficiency and determination to rescue survivors, the situation would have been even more disastrous, Yasmeen Almashan stresses. Groups such as The White Helmets epitomised the bravery of Syrian individuals, who had no choice but to become humanitarian workers. Nascent Syrian civil society organisations (CSOs) face extreme challenges as they lack resources and operate in egregious conditions. Maria Al-Abdeh, Director of Women Now for Development highlights that NGO-workers witness extreme harm and have to deal with cynical games between political factions who equally try to make a gain out of the suffering.

Despite the extreme conditions, the lack of resources, financial difficulties and being overstretched, Syrian CSOs have been more efficient and ingenious in their rescue and relief efforts than states and UN institutions. This phenomenon is not new. Pursuing justice for Syrians, CSOs have spearheaded initiatives at a time when the international institutional justice mobilisation has declined. In doing so, civil society has generated new initiatives in the fields of documentation, criminal accountability and truth-seeking. While justice efforts might seem far removed from the ongoing relief operations, both are intricately linked as they reveal weaknesses in the international political and humanitarian system and the problematic relations with the Assad regime.

In the run-up to increased international efforts, states and multilateral institutions need to consider how to reinforce their efforts to assist Syrian civilians. In order to remedy some of their blunders, governmental actors need to consider how their policies do no further harm. Firstly, they need to find better ways to protect civilians in the north-west, an area that has been subjected for years to the regime's annihilation policies and that became the football of power games between the regime, jihadi groups and Turkiye. A key aspect to highlight here is the efficiency of Syrian civil society that has proven to be a light in the darkness. Secondly, states need to curb Assad's enthusiasm about turning this disaster into a chance to escalate the war against his people.
