The companies making the pact include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI, among others. Thorn, a nonprofit group that builds technology to protect children from sexual abuse, and All Tech Is Human, an organization focused on promoting responsible tech development, organized the initiative, which was announced Tuesday.

""We're at a crossroads with generative AI, which holds both promise and risk in our work to defend children from sexual abuse,"" Rebecca Portnoff, vice president of data science at Thorn, said in a statement. "" ... That this diverse group of leading AI companies has committed to child safety principles should be a rallying cry for the rest of the tech community to prioritize child safety.""

The announcement comes a day after Stanford University's Internet Observatory released a report saying a flood of AI-generated sexual abuse material threatens to overwhelm the tip line at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit group that works with federal law enforcement.

Generative artificial intelligence allows users to easily create realistic video, pictures, audio and text. Bad actors may also use AI to manipulate authentic, benign images of children into sexualized content.

Child safety advocates warn the volume of realistic, AI-generated child abuse images makes the already challenging job of identifying and rescuing real victims even harder.

The alliance of AI companies has agreed to develop, deploy and maintain generative AI technologies following principles aimed at making their products less likely to create abuse material, making such content more reliably detected and limiting the distribution of the content. Each company has committed to release progress updates.

Some of the guidelines call for safeguarding datasets used to train AI systems from child sexual abuse material, continuosly testing models to better understand their capabilities of producing abusing content and investing in continued research to stay up to date about evolving threats.

The principles are outlined in a paper titled ""Safety by Design for Generative AI: Preventing Child Sexual Abuse.""

""It is imperative to prioritize child safety when building new technologies, including generative AI,"" Laurie Richardson, Google's vice president of trust and safety, said in a statement. "" ... We commend Thorn and All Tech Is Human for bringing key players in the industry together to standardize how we combat this material across the ecosystem.""

Some of the companies said they already had teams working on the issue but welcomed taking additional steps.

""Today's commitment marks a significant step forward in preventing the misuse of AI technologies to create or spread child sexual abuse material (AIG-CSAM) and other forms of sexual harm against children,"" Microsoft Chief Digital Safety Officer Courtney Gregoire wrote in a blog post. ""This collective action underscores the tech industry's approach to child safety, demonstrating a shared commitment to ethical innovation and the well-being of the most vulnerable members of society.""

Chelsea Carlson, who oversees child safety at OpenAI, said the firm is ""committed to working alongside Thorn, All Tech is Human and the broader tech community to uphold the Safety by Design principles and continue our work in mitigating potential harms to children.""

Other companies making commitments are Anthropic, Civitai, Metaphysic, Mistral AI and Stability AI.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Generative artificial intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Sexual abuse'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Artificial intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Child pornography'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Nonprofit organization'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protection', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Child protection'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Microsoft'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'OpenAI'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Amazon (company)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Meta Platforms'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Vice President of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Data science'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Google'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Missing_and_Exploited_Children', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'National Center for Missing and Exploited Children'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal law'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Child abuse'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Stanford University'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Internet'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Stable Diffusion'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Well-being'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Technology company'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ethics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Blog'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ecosystem'}}]",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/google_AP_24053715207332_NAT_0423,eng-9505382,-0.011764706,451589525,1,baynews9.com,news,Spectrum News Bay News 9,Generative artificial intelligence Sexual abuse Artificial intelligence Child pornography Nonprofit organization Child protection Microsoft OpenAI Amazon (company) Meta Platforms Vice President of the United States Data science Google National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Federal law Child abuse Stanford University Internet Stable Diffusion Well-being Technology company Ethics Blog Ecosystem,baynews9.com,543,Generative AI,2024,4,23,32,17,2024-04-23

Hamas says it has accepted cease-fire proposal; Israel reviewing deal

Hamas says it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to halt the monthslong war with Israel.

The militant group issued a statement Monday saying its supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, had delivered the news in a phone call with Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence minister.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that the proposal did not go far enough, but that it would nonetheless send negotiators to continue talks on a cease-fire agreement.

""Although the Hamas proposal is far from Israel's necessary requirements, Israel will send a delegation of working-class mediators to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel,"" Netanyahu's office said.

But Israeli officials also said the country would continue military operations in Gaza, approving strikes in Rafah shortly after.

Details of the proposal have not yet been released. In recent days, Egyptian and Hamas officials have said the cease-fire would take place in a series of stages, during which Hamas would release hostages it is holding in exchange for Israeli troop pullbacks from Gaza.

It is not clear whether the deal will meet Hamas' key demand of bringing about an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal.

President Joe Biden spoke to Netanyahu on Monday to keep him informed about the status of cease-fire talks, which were ongoing in Doha, Qatar, earlier in the day, according to the White House.

Biden has been briefed on Hamas' response, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that the U.S. and its partners were still reviewing that response.

In recent days, Egyptian and Hamas officials have said the cease-fire would take place in a series of stages in which Hamas would release hostages it is holding in exchange for Israeli troop pullbacks from Gaza. It is not clear whether the deal will meet Hamas' key demand of bringing about an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal.

The announcement came hours after the Israeli military ordered Palestinians in Rafah to leave the southern Gaza city ahead of a possible ground invasion. Israel has said that Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza, but the country's closest allies, including the United States, have sought to avert an invasion. News of Hamas' announcement sent people in Rafah cheering in the streets.

Israel's closest allies, including the United States, have repeatedly said that Israel shouldn't attack Rafah. The looming operation has raised global alarm over the fate of around 1.4 million Palestinians sheltering there.

Aid agencies have warned that an offensive will worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe and bring a surge of more civilian deaths in an Israeli campaign that in nearly seven months has killed 34,000 people and devastated the territory.

Hamas and key mediator Qatar said that invading Rafah will derail efforts by international mediators to broker a cease-fire

Israel will keep carrying out operations in Gaza as officials deliberate over a cease-fire proposal approved by Hamas, an Israeli military spokesperson says.

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari spoke after the Hamas militant group said it accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to halt the seven-month war with Israel. Israeli officials were studying the proposal late Monday and did not immediately comment.

""We examine every answer and reply very seriously,"" said Hagari. ""At the same time, we continue our operations in the Gaza Strip and will continue to do so.""

During the same address, Hagari said that Israel would reopen a major crossing for humanitarian aid to pass into Gaza as soon as possible, without specifying exactly when.

Israel closed the Kerem Shalom crossing Sunday after a Hamas mortar attack in the area killed four Israeli soldiers. The White House said earlier Monday that Netanyahu had agreed to reopen the crossing on a phone call with President Biden.

Trump's VP hopefuls attend Palm Beach event

Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Byron Donalds are rumored to be on former President Donald Trump's list of possible running mates.

But either of those choices could come with hurdles.

""The Constitution actually requires that the president and vice president be residents of different states, and Donald Trump has changed his residence down to Florida, so that might be problematic for him,"" George Washington University Professor Todd Belt said. ""Somebody might have to move in order to be able to be on the ballot.""

Rubio and Donalds were among potential running mates who attended a Trump retreat over the weekend as Trump looks to drum up enthusiasm for donors.

Rubio, a 52-year-old Cuban-American and the top ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, won his 2022 re-election campaign by double digits.

Donalds is a 45-year-old congressional representative from Southwest Florida. Though both are from Trump's new home state, analysts say their age could bring an advantage.

""We know that the voters are really frustrated with the ages of both of the major party candidates. So probably trying to select somebody younger might inject some of that enthusiasm,"" Belt said.

Another potential running mate, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, attended the retreat and poked fun at the laundry list of potential VP candidates who also appeared.

""If he had any more on there, they'd have been falling off the stage,"" he said. ""And prior to that, he said he there was 50. So I think the shortlist needs to be modified. Maybe there's a list of 50. If I'm on it, who would know?""

Experts say it's still very early in the race for a running mate to be announced.

""Usually, you have an unknown vice presidential selection made right before the convention at the end of summer, and that helps to boost more enthusiasm for the convention and people want to tune in and hear from the new vice presidential running mate,"" Belt said.

The Republican National Convention begins July 15 in Milwaukee.

Palestine campus protests hit UCF

Despite a possible cease-fire agreement between Isreal and Hamas, a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters have set up an encampment at the University of Central Florida's campus.

The protesters have set up several tents at the corner of University and Alafaya Trail roads.

This comes after a number of protesters gathered during graduations at UCF over the weekend.

The pro-Palestinian demonstrators are denouncing President Joe Biden and demanding the university divest from Israel.

These are similar chants that have been heard at major universities across the country.

""We are here to bring attention to the ground invasion to Gaza,"" said UCF student Nova Patterson.

Patterson, who says she is in her third year at the college, wants companies such as Lockheed Martin to divest their funds from certain countries, like Israel.

""So, when we say divest, we demand that they disclose and divest from all defense companies affecting Palestine, Congo, Sedan, Haiti, and other oppressed people from around the world,"" said Patterson.

Members of the group say they want the school to be more transparent and show what investments and money they have given to Israel.

""Ending internships and partnerships, disclosing all information that is not publicly available to the student body or anyone,"" Patterson said.

Among the group of demonstrators, none but Patterson would reveal their identity, and only one was willing to chant with his face uncovered.

A police presence was set up right across the street from the protesters.

The UCF administration did not return a request for comment.

When asked about a possible cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, Patterson says her group is not going anywhere.

""As long as UCF continues to not divest and not disclose and meet our demands, we will be out here,"" she said.

The protesters told Spectrum News that about 75% of their group currently attends the university.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng':
