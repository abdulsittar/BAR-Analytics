However, a second warning will come into force at 3pm on Thursday until 6pm on Friday when up to 10cm of snow could fall on lower ground.

Hilly areas could see as much as 20cm fall.

Met Office forecaster Dan Stroud a cold front sinking south across the UK will see temperatures drop dramatically this week.

""That t cold air will meet a weather front on Thursday evening turning rain to sleet and snow,"" he explained.

""But skies will clear overnight with temperatures falling below zero resulting in widespread frost so there is a real risk of very icy stretches on Tuesday morning.

""Most places will see temperatures of minus two or three but rural areas could get even lower.""

The meteorologist said Tuesday should be a bright and crisp day for most, however a number of rain showers are likely to turn to snow in the cold air.

""Inland areas are most likely to see sleet and snow,"" Mr Stroud added.

Daytime temperatures will struggle to climb above 4C with cold conditions expected to last throughout the week.

""It will become increasingly unsettled as the week goes on with potential for significant snowfall across Northern Ireland on Thursday into Friday,"" Mr Stroud added.

""There is a lot of uncertainty at this point though, but 5-10cm is possible on lower ground with 15-20cm on higher ground.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Snow'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Northern Ireland'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Northern Ireland'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Met Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hail'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'County'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_pellets', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ice pellets'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_(precipitation)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shower (precipitation)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_front', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cold front'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_front', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Weather front'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Meteorologist'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Frost'}}]",https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif,eng-8452523,-0.1529411764705882,415811580,1,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,news,Belfast Telegraph,Snow Northern Ireland Met Office Hail County Ice pellets Shower (precipitation) Cold front Weather front United Kingdom Meteorologist Frost,Ireland,IE,,,,,C4,C2,Europe,EU,Christian,11.0,11.0,8.0,13.0,16.0,14.0,16.0,24.0,4.0,19.0,23.0,12.0,17.0,28.0,70.0,68.0,35.0,24.0,65.0,European Union (EU),EU,,,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,6,13,15,2023-03-06

A yellow weather warning for cold conditions was in place on Monday evening, with snowfall expected in some parts - with higher ground most likely affected - and icy stretches on untreated surfaces.

The warning will remain in place for most of the week, with Tuesday also expected to bring hail amid snow showers in the north. Wednesday will see temperatures ease during the day, with no warning in place for Northern Ireland, but the cold will return overnight.

For Thursday and Friday, the yellow warning is for snow, with the Met Office suggesting parts of Northern Ireland, along with northern England and north Wales, are ""expected to see the worst of the conditions on Thursday"".

Affected locations could see snow of up to 20cm in the worst hit areas, meteorologists have said, while further warnings are ""very likely"" in the days ahead.

The yellow warning means that on Thursday, ""there is a slight chance that roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers"".

It has also been suggested that the cold weather could lead to travel delays and cancellations, while in the worst-hit areas there is a risk of interruptions to services including power supplies.

Meanwhile, the icy weather is occurring as ongoing industrial action by Department for Infrastructure roads service staff continues.

The department said strikes over pay by union members could see the gritting of roads disrupted.

The Met Office has said the spring cold snap was the result of an ""Arctic maritime airmass"" passing over the UK and Ireland that could see temperatures in NI drop to as low as -6 degrees.

Its deputy chief meteorologist Steven Keates said: ""Through Thursday and Friday the snow risk spreads to central and northern areas of the UK, though it's not possible to pick out precise locations regarding who will see the heaviest snowfall. With a developing situation, it's important to stay up to date with the latest forecast and further warnings are very likely.""

Meanwhile, Met Éireann has issued a yellow warning for the whole of Ireland for Tuesday, after the cold snap began on Monday evening.

It has warned that ""snow showers and icy patches are likely to cause some travel disruption"".","[{'uri': 'paul_ainsworth@irishnews.com', 'name': 'Paul Ainsworth', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Met Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Snow'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Northern Ireland'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Northern Ireland'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hail'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'North Wales'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Northern England'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Meteorologist'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Éireann', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Met Éireann'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Arctic'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ireland'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Ireland'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}]",https://binaries.irishnews.com/2023/03/06/182906520-caa4a92c-a8c6-47ca-b88e-47f9f64b6978.jpg,eng-8452523,-0.4588235294117647,415832880,1,irishnews.com,news,The Irish News,Met Office Snow Northern Ireland Hail North Wales Northern England Meteorologist Met Éireann Arctic Ireland United Kingdom,Ireland,IE,English-Irish,eng-gle,Center-left,https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiThe_Irish_News,C4,C2,Europe,EU,Christian,11.0,11.0,8.0,13.0,16.0,14.0,16.0,24.0,4.0,19.0,23.0,12.0,17.0,28.0,70.0,68.0,35.0,24.0,65.0,European Union (EU),EU,,,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,6,8,21,2023-03-06

""Disruptive snow and continuous snow will give us very significant issues because of the reduced capacity in our gritting service, winter fleet, because of the ongoing industrial action by some of the industrial unions.""
