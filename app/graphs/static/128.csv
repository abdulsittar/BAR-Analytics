Trump announced on Monday the U.S. would not commit to any timetable to end its military presence in Afghanistan where it has been bogged down for the better part of two decades.

The U.S. has about 8,400 troops in the country, and Trump's comments made it clear there would be no indications about future modifications to the American forces.

The American president further called out Pakistan, saying it provides ""safe havens for terrorist organizations"" that have contributed to the ongoing tumult in Afghanistan.

However, in a statement from Pakistan's foreign ministry which followed a cabinet meeting chaired by interim Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, the government said:

""No country in the world has done more than Pakistan to counter the menace of terrorism. No country in the world has suffered more than Pakistan from the scourge of terrorism, often perpetrated from outside our borders.

""It is, therefore disappointing that the U.S. policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation in this effort.""

Counterterrosim

""Pakistan has been and will continue to be part of global counterterrorism efforts. Pakistan and the United States have been close allies in the fight against terrorism, which is a common threat for all nations of the world,"" it went on to say.

As a matter of policy, it maintained, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country.

Instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens, the U.S. needs to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism, it added.

""The threat to peace and security cannot be isolated from the complex interplay of geopolitics, [the] continued existence of festering disputes and pursuit of hegemonic policies,"" it said, adding:

""Non-resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains the primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region.""

Pakistan also said 17 years of military action had failed to bring peace to Afghanistan, and was not likely to do so in the future. Only an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned politically negotiated solution can lead to sustainable peace in Afghanistan, it added.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cabinet (government)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Geopolitics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Hegemony'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Jammu and Kashmir'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Jammu and Kashmir'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",http://aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2017/08/22/thumbs_m_c_78ee9f2e9edd7542057dcd19466b8056.jpg?v=224721,eng-3382459,-0.3647058823529412,241122300,1,aa.com.tr,news,Anadolu Ajansı,Donald Trump Terrorism Pakistan Afghanistan Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Cabinet (government) South Asia Geopolitics Counter-terrorism Hegemony Jammu and Kashmir,Turkey,TR,,,,,C14,C12,Asia,AS,Muslim,95.0,147.0,152.0,128.0,137.0,68.0,65.0,50.0,71.0,59.0,63.0,74.0,86.0,66.0,37.0,45.0,85.0,46.0,49.0,,,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,22,25,18,2017-08-22

This notion is narrow, deeply flawed, and creates internal contradictions -- and failures -- in US policy in the region.

Speaking at Fort Myer on Monday about his Afghanistan policy, US President Donald Trump has put Pakistan on notice. While acknowledging that Pakistan has been a valued partner in the past, he has, like his predecessor, Barack Obama, accused Pakistan of harbouring 'criminals and terrorists' and said ""our new strategy [will] change the approach and how to deal with Pakistan.""

In 2009, President Barack Obama said much the same. So, what's new?

Trump. Trump is the new feature in this policy, not because he has found an Open Sesame to the problem of Afghanistan and, by extension, the region, but because he will make a wicked problem wickeder through an internally incoherent policy.

Consider.

For a long time the thinking in some circles in Washington has been to accuse Pakistan for US failures in Afghanistan. This line of argument is also trotted out by Indian and Afghan analysts. If Pakistan reins in the Taliban and the Haqqanis, Afghanistan's political and security landscape will become salubrious for the kind of peace and prosperity that the US and Kabul envisages.

That's a sham. Pakistan is just one regional player. There are others: the US itself, Iran, Russia, China and India. At least three, Iran, Russia and China, consider the Taliban political actors. Iran and Russia also fund and arm certain Taliban groups, a fact known to and stated by US officials.

But let's keep that aside and see the options the US can use to coerce Pakistan.

US leverage over Pakistan is on the wane

Two are upfront: aid and coalition support fund. Both are down to a trickle. In fact, Islamabad as well as the General Headquarters (Pakistan Army) have told multiple US civil and military delegations that Pakistan is not interested in US aid or military support. There are no big-ticket items involved since the US Congress scuttled the financing for the sale of Block C&D F-16s. The US has already exhausted any leverage there.

The other possibility is withdrawing the major non-NATO ally status. In real terms, given the state of relations since 2011, this does not mean anything, not even in a symbolic sense.

What else? This is where the coercive possibilities come in. There's been much debate in a months-long review of how to deal with Pakistan.

There are two schools of thought: one, which is the driver of the current policy, rejects Pakistan's strategic concerns and advocates arm-twisting Pakistan to force Islamabad to fall in step; the other believes that putting Pakistan in the doghouse will make matters worse and the US must be sympathetic to Pakistan's perceptions while impressing upon Islamabad its concerns and find a balance grounded in quid pro quos.

The coercion, therefore, is likely to be graduated. In his speech, Trump said that he is lifting restrictions on how field commanders must operate in terms of the challenges they face. This means giving US commanders a free hand in determining how to identify and neutralise threats. Read in conjunction with Trump's statement that Pakistan harbours 'terrorists and criminals' on its soil, the US could begin drone attacks outside of the air bands in which Pakistani governments have secretly been allowing US drones to operate. This could mean attacks in settled areas and cities: Peshawar, Bannu, Kohat, Quetta, Kuchlak, or even Karachi.

If this does not have the desired result, the US could begin taking measures for what Dr Moeed Yusuf has called 'soft diplomatic isolation'. Such measures could include sanctioning individuals and entities, especially military and intelligence officials (that would mean restricted travel, freezing of assets and even arrests on foreign soils), putting the squeeze by withdrawing support from international financial institutions, pushing a resolution through the United Nations Security Council, among other things.

Given the upcoming bleak economic picture painted by independent economists, most pointing to a looming balance of payment crisis, Pakistan, according to them, will need to go back to the International Monetary Fund. That's another area where Pakistan could be squeezed.

The final and most extreme measure, as advocated by some in the US, could be to declare Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism. That would be a clear break in a long-troubled relationship. What happens next will draw the battle lines.

Trump might make things worse

Whether any or all of this will give the US the 'win' Trump thinks he can still pocket is of course an illusion. It won't because it can't.

What's deeply ironic is that coercing and trying to isolate Pakistan will only worsen the problem. Pakistan, in conjunction with its regional allies, could either take a tougher position by aligning its interests with theirs or, worst-case scenario, get destabilised. Neither development is savoury for policymakers in Washington, or for the region. China already knows that the US is propping India up as a countervailing force. That doesn't go down well with Beijing.

Hopefully, it will not come to that. While Pakistan's official response will be formulated after the National Security Committee meeting, chaired by the prime minister, the initial reaction, in seeking to work with the US has, nonetheless, rejected the allegations trotted out by Trump. The statement also references Jammu and Kashmir as the core dispute thereby pointing to tense Pakistan-India relations as a major source of instability in the region.

The expectation seems to be that Trump's speech was not the policy but its salient features. The policy will have its nuances and multiple tools. Rex Tillerson wants to engage Pakistan to discuss the play. That's where the two sides could figure out what's possible and what's not. But there's the wild card, Trump, who is now being played by McMaster and the hardliners in the White House. If they prevail, the region gets a problem that will make the current situation look like a teddy bear's picnic.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score':

Trump on Tuesday had ruled out the possibility of American troops withdrawing from Afghanistan anytime soon, and blamed Pakistan for harboring terrorist safe havens.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in an address to the nation sought friendly ties with its neighboring countries including Pakistan.

""An unstable Afghanistan is in no one's interest, and Pakistan has also witnessed many losses [because of it],"" he said.

""Today, there is consensus that Pakistan should revise its previous approach. This is an opportunity,"" he added.

Afghanistan has long blamed Pakistan for attacks in the country, including the Kabul suicide bombing this June which left 90 dead.

Ghani said that Afghanistan has never tried to destabilize Pakistan.

He called upon the Taliban and their supporters to forget thinking about prolonging the war and dividing Afghanistan.

""Once again, I call on you to take the path of peace and negotiation,"" Ghani said.

Meanwhile, an irate Pakistan said it was not looking for any kind of assistance from the U.S. but acknowledgement of its contributions in the war against terrorism.

During a meeting with David Hale, the U.S. ambassador in Islamabad, Pakistan's powerful Army Cheif Gen.

Qamar Javed Bajwa said: ""We are not looking for any material or financial assistance from the U.S but trust, understanding and acknowledgement of our contributions,"" according to the military's media wing Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR).

The meeting is seen as an attempt to quell differences and find ways to continue cooperation between the two longtime allies on Afghanistan in future.

Gen. Bajwa, according to the statement, told the U.S envoy that peace in Afghanistan was as important for Pakistan as for any other country.

""We have done a lot towards that end and shall keep on doing our best, not to appease anyone but in line with our national interest and national policy,"" he said.

The U.S. invaded Afghanistan in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, ousting the Taliban after it gave sanctuary to now deceased al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden.

Recent years have seen the Taliban and other armed groups grow in strength as the U.S.-backed central government in Kabul struggles to assert its authority across the country it nominally controls.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Suicide attack'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Javed_Bajwa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Qamar Javed Bajwa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hale_(diplomat)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'David Hale (diplomat)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Inter-Services Public Relations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Osama bin Laden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}]",http://aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2017/08/23/thumbs_m_c_63e8703e40a7db9f4a74084ecf020785.jpg?v=184907,eng-3382459,-0.09019607843137256,241242000,1,aa.com.tr,news,Anadolu Ajansı,Ashraf Ghani Pakistan Afghanistan Donald Trump President of Afghanistan Suicide attack Terrorism Qamar Javed Bajwa David Hale (diplomat) Inter-Services Public Relations War on Terror Taliban Islamabad Kabul Osama bin Laden Al-Qaeda,Turkey,TR,,,,,C14,C12,Asia,AS,Muslim,95.0,147.0,152.0,128.0,137.0,68.0,65.0,50.0,71.0,59.0,63.0,74.0,86.0,66.0,37.0,45.0,85.0,46.0,49.0,,,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,40,3,2017-08-24

Nicholson, başkent Kabil'de düzenlediği basın toplantısında, NATO ve ABD'nin Afganistan'da terörle mücadele konusunda Afgan güvenlik güçlerinin yanında yer alacağını belirtti.

ABD'nin yeni Afganistan stratejisinin Afganistan halkının geleceği için çok önemli olduğunu ifade eden Nicholson, yeni stratejinin yürürlüğe girmesiyle Afgan güvenlik güçlerine desteğin artacağını bildirdi.

Nicholson ayrıca Afganistan'da artık terör örgütlerinin yer bulamayacağını vurguladı.

Taliban'a barış çağrısı

Taliban örgütüne de çağrıda bulunan Nicholson, ''Silahlarınızı bırakarak barışa katılın.'' dedi.

Afganistan halkının barış istediğinin altını çizen Nicholson, ülkede barışın sağlanması için hep birlikte çalışacaklarını aktardı.

NATO'nun Afgan güvenlik güçlerine danışmanlık ve destek vermeye devam edeceğini dile getiren Nicholson, bu konuda Afgan özel ve hava kuvvetlerine eğitim verileceğini kaydetti.

NATO'nun Kararlı Destek Misyonu, Afganistan'da yerel birlikleri eğitmek, danışmanlık yapmak ve yardım etmek için yaklaşık 13 bin 500 asker bulundururken bu sayının 8 bin 400'ünü ABD askerleri oluşturuyor.","[{'uri': 'hasan_hız@yenisafak.com', 'name': 'Hasan Hız', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}]",http://yenisafak.feo.doracdn.com/resize/47uQufiZbmsgHk3H/600/0/resim/reuters/TurkeyPictureService/image/2017/08/24/2017-08-24t065208z_123592899_rc1d0bb9c460_rtrmadp_3_usa-trump-afghanistan.jpg,eng-3382459,,241284600,1,yenisafak.com,news,Yeni Şafak,NATO Afghanistan Kabul Taliban Terrorism,Turkey,TR,,,,,C14,C12,Asia,AS,Muslim,95.0,147.0,152.0,128.0,137.0,68.0,65.0,50.0,71.0,59.0,63.0,74.0,86.0,66.0,37.0,45.0,85.0,46.0,49.0,,,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,30,15,2017-08-24

Pakistan Ulusal Güvenlik Kurulu, Başbakan Şahid Hakan Abbasi'nin başkanlığında toplandı.

Yaklaşık 5 saat süren toplantının ardından yapılan açıklamada, ABD'nin Pakistan'ı ""günah keçisi"" yaptığı fakat bunun Afganistan'ın istikrarına fayda sağlamayacağı vurgulandı.

Afganistan savaşının Pakistan'dan yürütülemeyeceği ifade edilen açıklamada, ABD'nin, Pakistan'da terörün artmasından sorumlu olanlar dahil Afganistan'da teröristlerin barındığı sığınakları yok etmesi gerektiği belirtildi.

Pakistan Dışişleri Bakanlığından dün yapılan açıklamada, ""Dünyada hiçbir ülke, terörizm tehdidiyle Pakistan kadar uğraşmamıştır. Dünyada hiçbir ülke, sıklıkla sınırları dışından gelen terörizm belasından Pakistan kadar çok çekmemiştir."" ifadesi kullanılmıştı. Açıklamada, ""ABD'nin yeni Afganistan stratejisinin"", Pakistan'ın küresel terörizmle mücadelede yaptığı büyük fedakarlıkları göz ardı etmesinin hayal kırıklığı yarattığı belirtilmişti.

Açıklamada, Trump'ın Pakistan'ın ""terörist örgütlere sığınacak liman"" sağladığına dair değerlendirmesine atfen de ABD'nin gerçeği yansıtmayan bu anlatımdan vazgeçmesi istenmişti.

- ABD'nin yeni Afganistan stratejisi

ABD Başkanı Donald Trump, Virginia'da Fort Myer askeri üssünde yaptığı konuşmada, ABD'nin Afganistan'dan hızlı bir şekilde çekilmesinin ""öngörülebilir ve kabul edilemez"" sonuçlarını önlemek için mücadeleyi sürdürmeleri gerektiğini açıklamıştı.

ABD'nin Afganistan'da sahadaki duruma göre hareket edeceğini söyleyen Trump, ""Afganlar kendi ulusunu inşa edecek ve kendi geleceğini belirleyecek. Onların başarılı olmasını istiyoruz."" demişti.","[{'uri': 'hasan_hız@yenisafak.com', 'name': 'Hasan Hız', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerika_Birleşik_Devletleri_başkanı', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Amerika Birleşik Devletleri başkanı'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Prime minister'}}]",http://yenisafak.feo.doracdn.com/resize/47uQufiZbmsgHk3H/600/0/resim/upload/2017/08/24/10/59/74aef29922.jpg,eng-3382459,,241301220,1,yenisafak.com,news,Yeni Şafak,Donald Trump Terrorism Pakistan Afghanistan Amerika Birleşik Devletleri başkanı Prime minister,Turkey,TR,,,,,C14,C12,Asia,AS,Muslim,95.0,147.0,152.0,128.0,137.0,68.0,65.0,50.0,71.0,59.0,63.0,74.0,86.0,66.0,37.0,45.0,85.0,46.0,49.0,,,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,7,20,2017-08-24

The country's National Security Committee, which advises the government on security and foreign affairs, met Prime Minister Shahid Khan Abbasi in capital Islamabad.

In the five-hour-long meeting, attended by three chiefs of the armed forces and senior ministers, it was said that the U.S. was scapegoating Pakistan, something that will not help stabilize Afghanistan.

Trump announced on Monday that the U.S. would not commit to a timetable to end its military presence in Afghanistan and blamed Pakistan for harboring terrorists on its soil.

In a tersely-worded statement the committee asked Washington to eliminate terrorist sanctuaries in Aghanistan, including those responsible for spreading terror in Pakistan.

""The Afghan war cannot be fought in Pakistan,"" said the statement.

The committee called U.S. claims of giving billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan misleading.

""The reimbursements to Pakistan since 2001 only account for part of the cost of ground facilities and air corridors used by the U.S. for its operations in Afghanistan, rather than any financial aid or assistance,"" the statement added.

The committee said that the U.S. should recognize the sacrifices of thousands of Pakistanis and $120 billion of economic losses the country incurred during its part in the war.

Over the years, it added, Pakistan had worked with both the U.S and Afghanistan to promote peace through dialogue, which in Pakistan's view, remained the best option to bring stability to this war-torn country.

""A prolonged military campaign in Afghanistan has resulted in destruction and killing of hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians,"" it said.

The committee maintained that Pakistan had taken indiscriminate actions against terrorist networks, proof of which is the improvement in the security situation within Pakistan.

The U.S. invaded Afghanistan in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, ousting the Taliban after it gave sanctuary to Osama bin Laden. It currently has 8,400 troops in Afghanistan.

However, recent years have seen the Taliban and other armed groups grow in strength as the U.S.-backed government in Kabul struggles to assert its authority across the country.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Osama bin Laden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}]",http://aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2017/08/24/thumbs_m_c_3534fe57a76ffcc88499aa890d1bff7d.jpg?v=194801,eng-3382459,-0.3568627450980392,241327380,1,aa.com.tr,news,Anadolu Ajansı,Terrorism United States Pakistan Afghanistan United States Armed Forces Islamabad Taliban Osama bin Laden Kabul,Turkey,TR,,,,,C14,C12,Asia,AS,Muslim,95.0,147.0,152.0,128.0,137.0,68.0,65.0,50.0,71.0,59.0,63.0,74.0,86.0,66.0,37.0,45.0,85.0,46.0,49.0,,,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,23,3,2017-08-25

Taliban ise Afgan komandoları karşısında hiçbir savaşı kazanmadı ve kazanamayacak"" dedi.

Kararlı Destek Misyonu Komutanı General John Nicholson, Afganistan'a temasları sırasında Afgan Ulusal Ordusu Özel Harekat Komutanlığı'nı (ANASOC) ziyaret ederek, faaliyete geçirilen özel operasyon birliği için düzenlenen törende konuştu. Nicholson yaptığı konuşmada, ""Bugün dünyada en önemli şey terörle mücadele ve başarısızlığın faturası ise düşünülemeyecek kadar yüksek. Sadece Afganistan ve Afgan halkının geleceği için değil tüm dünya için terörle olan savaşı kazanmalıyız. Afganistan'da başarısız olursak dünya çapında gerçekleştirilebilecek terör saldırılarını kendimiz davet etmiş oluruz. Eğer başarısız olsaydık, milyonlara ulaşan bir göç dalgası ortaya çıkardı. Eğer başarısız olsaydık, zaten ülkelere yayılmış olan cihatçıları küresel çapta cesaretlendirmiş olurduk"" dedi.

Terör saldırılarının son zamanlarda Avrupa çevresinde gerçekleştiğini ve dualarının Barselona saldırısının kurbanlarıyla birlikte olduğunu söyleyen Nicholson, Afganistan'ın sadece kendi geleceği için savaşmadığını, insanlığın geleceği için savaştıklarını ve Kararlı Destek Misyonu'nun bu savaşta onların yanında bulunduğunu söyledi. Nicholson, ""Afganistan Özel Güvenlik Birlikleri Ktah Khas ve Afgan komandoları hiç savaş kaybetmediler. Taliban ise Afgan komandoları karşısında hiçbir savaşı kazanmadı ve kazanamayacak. Bu yüzden kolordu, Ktah Khas ve Afgan komandoları bölgedeki en saygın ve en korkulan güç"" diye konuştu.

""Bu tören Taliban için sonun başlangıcıdır""

Geçtiğimiz yıl Afgan komandolarının Kunduz, Lashkar Gah, Tarin Kowt ve Farah'ı başarılı bir şekilde savunduğunu ve DEAŞ'ı yıkıma uğrattıklarını söyleyen Nicholson, ""Şu an biz burada otururken Afgan komandoları Taliban'ı bozguna uğratıyor. Bu komandolar savaş alanına geldiğinde düşmanın kaçmaktan veya ölmekten başka çaresi yoktur. Afgan komandoları ABD ve NATO desteğinden bağımsız olarak beş operasyonun dördüne bağımsız olarak katılıyor ve bugün itibariyle daha ölümcül olacaklar"" dedi. Bu yüzden Afgan ordusundaki komandoların sayısını iki katına çıkardıklarını söyleyen Nicholson, ""Hem kendi ülkeniz hem de bizim için kazanacaksınız. Bu yüzden bu tören Taliban için sonun başlangıcıdır"" şeklinde konuştu.Nicholson, ""Afgan Ulusal Ordusu Özel Harekat Komutanlığı (ANASOC) tarafından desteklenen Afgan Ordusu'nun saldırı kabiliyeti ve önümüzde duran komandolar Afgan hükümeti ve uluslararası topluluk tarafından sonuna kadar desteklenecek ve bu Afganistan için yeni bir çağ açacak. Sizler bu bölgenin önde gelen savaş gücüsünüz. Bugün özel operasyon birliğini faaliyete geçirilmesiyle Afganistan'nın düşmanlarına son verildiğini kutluyoruz.
