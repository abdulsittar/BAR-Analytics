The California National Guard helped with at least 56 rescues in the early hours of Saturday morning after a levee breach inundated the small community of Pajaro in Monterey County. On Saturday morning, the governor's office said that it was working to help the largely Latino community, which has a population of just under 3,000.

""My heart hurts tonight for the residents of Pajaro,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, said in a tweet. ""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight.""

As the sun rose over the state, more than 9,000 residents were still under evacuation orders as California continued to be pummeled by what meteorologists call an atmospheric river, extremely moist storms common to the West Coast. It is the 10th such event to hit the state this season.

By early Friday afternoon, the scale of the flooding was already immense. In the Bay Area, commuters had to navigate around the flooding, which closed several roads, including a major freeway in Oakland. Tens of thousands remained without power on Saturday, after about 55,000 customers were affected on Friday. According to officials, at least two had died.

The situation only continued to worsen along the state's Central Coast and Salinas Valley - often called the nation's ""Salad Bowl"" because of the leafy greens and other vegetables grown there. In parts of the region, key evacuation routes were impassable as raging floodwaters poured across roads. There was a separate levee break nearly 150 miles away from Pajaro in the community of Cutler in Tulare County.

Forecasters project that the unrelenting rainfall will last through the coming week.

Although the main slug of moisture associated with the atmospheric river had moved through on Friday, additional moderate to heavy downpours were expected to fan through central and northern California late Saturday and into Sunday. Then, yet another atmospheric river originating from near Hawaii is projected to come ashore.

By Tuesday, 3 to 6 more inches of rain is likely along the coast, with double-digit perception totals in the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada. That is projected to come down as another 4 to 8 feet of snow in the highest elevations, leading to more flooding, rapid snowmelt and avalanches.

Flood watches remain in effect for locations below 4,000 feet elevation in central and northern California. The National Weather Service office in Hanford, Calif., said that many of the creeks and rivers that have been in flood stage since Friday will continue to rise through the weekend.

The Weather Service started issuing flash flood warnings on Friday as heavy rain combined with swift snowmelt to turn creeks and streams into roaring rapids.

The community of Springville in central California's Tulare County, home to about 1,000 residents along Highway 190, was placed under a dire ""flash flood emergency"" during the morning hours.

""This is a particularly dangerous situation. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!,"" warned the Weather Service in Hanford.

Drone footage revealed dozens of homes treading water, at least one structural collapse and a number of others on the brink of destruction.

In an online warning to residents, the Tulare County Resource Management Agency described the flooding as ""unprecedented,"" writing ""Roads crews cannot sign every flooded roadway at this time.""

Up to 4.3 inches of rain was reported in Tulare County - which is southeast of Fresno and northeast of Bakersfield - within 24 hours ending Saturday morning. Three to eight feet of water is contained in the Sierra snowpack - likely much more in spots - meaning the warmth of an atmospheric river can quickly melt enough water to effectively double what pours into creeks and streams during a snowstorm.

Meanwhile, mountain communities in the Sierra are working to sort out where to put their ever-accumulating snow. While mostly snow has fallen above 8,000 feet, rain has fallen into the spongy snowpack beneath that.

The Central Sierra Snow Lab off Interstate 80 near Donner Pass, near 7,000 feet, measured a ""rain-soaked"" 9.3 inches of snow Friday and has tallied 617 inches of snow since October.

That's converted the snow into a cement-like sludge, which in some instances has caused structural collapses. In other cases, high avalanche danger remains a concern.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri':

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide. Crews went door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by waist-high water.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter. He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

Officials worked along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached about midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains.

""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. National Weather Service meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday. The 1892 historical landmark was left severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Newsom declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, melted lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible. Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit areas of high elevation mid-week, it said.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide. Crews went door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by waist-high water.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter. He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

Officials worked along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached about midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains.

""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. National Weather Service meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday. The 1892 historical landmark was left severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Newsom declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, melted lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible. Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit areas of high elevation mid-week, it said.

The levee -- 3 miles upstream from the town of Pajaro -- breached late Friday night, said Nicholas Pasculli, a Monterey County spokesperson. Patrols noticed ""bubbling up in the adjacent farmland"" at 11 p.m., the first sign there was a problem.

Thirty minutes later, the levee failed, Pasculli said. As of Saturday morning, he said, ""the failure is approximately 100 feet wide."" The town of Pajaro -- with a population of 1,700, mostly farmworkers -- is under water, he said.

Authorities conducted 60 rescues that included the use of high-water vehicles, the sheriff's diving team and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's swift-water team, officials said. National Guard personnel were dispatched to assist. At least 96 people were placed in county shelters.

Pajaro weathered recent storms because a flood wall in the lower part of the levee held up, said Monterey County Supervisor Luis Alejo.

""We had avoided just barely, by the grace of God, the flooding of the community,"" Alejo said.

Residents were ordered to evacuate Friday afternoon, but some didn't, Alejo said, because they ""were hoping that the worst would not happen because the levee did not breech during the last set of storms.""

Monterey County sheriff's officials, Watsonville police and the California Highway Patrol conducted a second round of evacuation notices Friday around 11:30 p.m.

Alejo said he has asked President Joe Biden and Gov. Gavin Newsom to visit Pajaro. He said it will take months to repair homes, and the town will need significant help to recover.

""This is a disadvantaged community that often doesn't get the attention it deserves,"" Alejo said. ""These are our friends, our neighbors, these are people that we really care about, and we know that they're going to go through some tremendous hardship over the next several months.""

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide. Crews went door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by waist-high water.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter. He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

Officials worked along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached about midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains.

""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen yearslong drought conditions. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. National Weather Service meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday. The 1892 historical landmark was severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- in the afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning for the Sierra Nevada foothills as thunderstorms and hail blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Newsom declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible. Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit areas of high elevation mid-week, it said.

It's rising',"Crowds of onlookers stood on the Watsonville side of the Pajaro River Bridge looking at the swollen muddy river rushing below and the closed-off, submerged town of Pajaro on the other side.

Emergency responders -- sheriff's deputies, police, county divers and boat rescue crews -- were parked along the bridge behind yellow tape.

Police and county sheriff deputies stopped both the curious from crossing, as well as a few people who said they had family members or businesses on the other side.

One man, who declined to provide his name, said his grandmother was stuck on the other side in a flooded home. The police would not let him cross but took down her address and promised to check.

Connie and Victor Alvarez, owner of Alvarez Collison and Paint, said they were trying to get in to check on their business. They said they'd been notified by Monterey County that their business was probably flooded and there was concern that toxic chemicals and solvents could be getting into the water.

As the most recent storm moved out of the region Saturday, this Central Coast community was among the hardest hit. A levee failure on the Pajaro River in Monterey County triggered massive flooding and prompted hundreds of evacuations and dozens of water rescues.

""So, we're here to check,"" said Connie Alvarez as she waited for a sheriff's deputy to check to see if she had permission to cross.

Javier Gomez, legislative analyst for Monterey County Supervisor Luis Alejo, pointed to rushing water pouring south and west along the flooded streets of Porter, San Juan and Brooklyn.

""The water is still coming in,"" he said. ""It's rising.""

Three blocks upstream, on the other side of a flooded area, three people were walking east, along the river, carrying large black plastic bags. Gomez said those were probably some of the ""hundreds"" of people who didn't heed the evacuation warnings.

""I don't know how many stayed,"" he said. ""But we've been doing back-to-back rescues all day. Feels like there were at least 100.""

Monterey County Sheriff Deputy Mike Hampson said many of the same people had been evacuated in January when the river got high.

""At that time, they were displaced for about a week,"" he said, noting that this time it's probably going to be longer -- as crews will have to clean flooded and contaminated streets and homes and restore electricity to the area.

He said many people who evacuated last night are also now trying to come back to get their pets and belongings. He can't let them in. He said the Fire Department is taking down addresses and checking on animals.

""It's hard,"" he said. ""You can hear dogs barking in some of the houses.""

At the Santa Cruz County fairgrounds, about 150 evacuees from Pajaro were talking, drawing, going through donated items -- such as clothing and blankets -- and getting ready for what they guessed would be a stay of at least a few weeks.

Andres Garcia, 39, said this was the third time he'd been evacuated from Pajaro by the flooding river. He was here in January, and also in 1995 -- when the town was flooded, ""even worse"" than it is now, he said. He added that he's unable to work right now -- the mountain bike shop that employs him is also underwater.

He'll probably have to claim unemployment, he said, shaking his head. He, his wife and their 8-year-old daughter left the inundated city early Saturday after they got a knock on the door from a sheriff's deputy urging them to leave.

Garcia said they left before the water got too high, but he has no idea what state his house is in now. His neighbor, Laura Garcia, left after dawn.

She showed a video of water sloshing through her house -- lapping against a crib, chairs, dining room set and shelves.

Andres Garcia said many people will be out of work as long as the water stays high -- especially people who toil in the now submerged fields around the area.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sheriff'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Toxicity'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Town'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bridge'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chemical substance'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriffs_in_the_United_States', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sheriffs in the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'County (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watsonville,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Watsonville, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Watsonville, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Alejo', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Luis Alejo'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_(California)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Central Coast (California)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Plastic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Brooklyn'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Brooklyn'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'San Juan, Puerto Rico'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'San Juan, Puerto Rico'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Puerto Rico'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_bike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mountain bike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Fair'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Unemployment'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Electricity'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Dog'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Santa Cruz County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Santa Cruz County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}]",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e9acb1a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+105/resize/1200x675!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb7%2Ff48d8697471d97528835123482f1%2Fap23069851462683.jpg,eng-8468865,0.05098039215686279,416280900,1,latimes.com,news,Los Angeles Times,"Pajaro River Monterey County, California Sheriff Toxicity Town Bridge Chemical substance Sheriffs in the United States County (United States) Watsonville, California Luis Alejo Central Coast (California) Levee Flood Plastic Brooklyn San Juan, Puerto Rico Mountain bike Fair Unemployment Electricity Dog Santa Cruz County, California",United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,35,1,2023-03-12

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Lew Bauman with the Monterey County Water Resources Agency said the levee breached at about midnight Friday. Bowman said the breach was about 120 feet long.

""It continues to flow, it will flow uncontrolled until we are able to secure that with interim protective measures,"" Bowman said.

Personnel from the California Department of Water Resources were en route to ""formulate a mitigation plan"" to ""close that breach,"" Bowman added.

Bauman said that as the water flow continues in the coming days, more evacuation warnings and orders will be issued as necessary.

Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto, meanwhile, said that crews conducted 90 rescues Friday night and Saturday.

Crews had gone door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" wrote Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on Twitter.

Alejo called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday.

It breached ""following a heroic effort by our staff to fight that flood event, unfortunately they were overwhelmed by the flows coming down that watershed,"" Bauman said.

Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued around 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove out to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro.

""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands like Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains.

""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels in the atmospheric river's aftermath. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth.

California appeared to be ""well on its way to a fourth year of drought"" before the early winter series of storms, Anderson said Friday. ""We're in a very different condition now,"" he added.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecasted an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible along the state's central coast, San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys and the southern Sierra Nevada foothills into midweek.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said. Officials reported about 32 inches of snow had fallen by Saturday morning at the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno, Nevada.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type':

The next atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture drawn from the tropics -- is forecast for Monday, and could be more powerful than the last.

California has been inundated by the latest front. In Oroville, north of Sacramento, a swift water rescue team helped two people stranded on an island in the Feather River get to safety. In the Central Coast, river flooding in Atascadero and Paso Robles was widely feared.

Residents of parts of Monterey County woke up to urgent flood warnings and orders to move out after a levee was breached around midnight by the rain-swollen waters of the Pajaro River, county officials said.

California National Guard troops and Monterey County sheriff's and fire first responders helped residents in flooded neighborhoods evacuate to higher ground Saturday.

An area firefighter was injured by a falling tree, they said. Details were not provided about the person's condition and where the injury occurred.

More than 90 rescues were completed since Friday, with as many as 20 by boat, Monterey County officials said at an afternoon news conference.

County Board of Supervisors Chair Luis Alejo said the river-adjacent town of Pajaro, with a population of 1,700, was left in 1 to 3 feet of standing water and estimated that recovery and repairs for area homes could take months.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_river', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Atmospheric river'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_storm', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Winter storm'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oroville,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Oroville, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Oroville, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_National_Guard', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'California National Guard'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather_River', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Feather River'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_(California)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Central Coast (California)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'County (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sacramento, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Sacramento, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paso_Robles,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Paso Robles, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Paso Robles, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atascadero,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Atascadero, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Atascadero, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Alejo', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Luis Alejo'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_supervisors', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Board of supervisors'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Firefighter'}}]","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-03/230311-ca-flooding-1-cc-0647p-d4122c.jpg",eng-8468865,-0.07450980392156858,416283180,1,nbcnews.com,news,NBC News,"Atmospheric river California Levee Winter storm Oroville, California Monterey County, California California National Guard Feather River Pajaro River Central Coast (California) County (United States) Flood Sacramento, California Paso Robles, California Atascadero, California Luis Alejo Board of supervisors Firefighter",United-States,USA,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,13,2,2023-03-12

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide.

Crews went door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by waist-deep water.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter. He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. Construction was scheduled to start in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains. ""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen yearslong drought conditions. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 historical landmark was severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- in the afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. Construction was scheduled to start in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains. ""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen yearslong drought conditions. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 historical landmark was severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- in the afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said.

WATSONVILLE -- A Northern California agricultural community famous for its strawberry crop was forced to evacuate early Saturday after the Pajaro River's levee was breached by flooding from a new atmospheric river that pummeled the state.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide. Crews had gone door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came, but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" wrote Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on Twitter.

Alejo called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued around 5 a.m. Saturday in Pajaro. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents, but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove out to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro.

""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels in the atmospheric river's aftermath. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning for the Sierra Nevada foothills as thunderstorms and hail blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were issued in Fresno Count y, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth.

California appeared to be ""well on its way to a fourth year of drought"" before the early winter series of storms, Anderson said Friday. ""We're in a very different condition now,"" he added.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecasted an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible along the state's Central Coast, San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys and the southern Sierra Nevada foothills into midweek.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said. Officials reported about 32 inches of snow had fallen by Saturday morning at the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno, Nevada.

Dazio reported from Los Angeles.

By NIC COURY and STEFANIE DAZIO - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- A Northern California agricultural community famous for its strawberry crop was forced to evacuate early Saturday after the Pajaro River's levee was breached by flooding from a new atmospheric river that pummeled the state.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet (30.48 meters) wide. Crews had gone door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" wrote Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on Twitter.

Alejo called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued around 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove out to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro.

""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands like Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres (1,011 hectares) of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains.

""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels in the atmospheric river's aftermath. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot (25.91 meter) eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno Count y, nearly 100 miles (160.93 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth.

California appeared to be ""well on its way to a fourth year of drought"" before the early winter series of storms, Anderson said Friday. ""We're in a very different condition now,"" he added.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecasted an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible along the state's central coast, San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys and the southern Sierra Nevada foothills into midweek.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said. Officials reported about 32 inches (81 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning at the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno, Nevada.

It's rising',"WATSONVILLE, Calif. -- Crowds of onlookers stood on the Watsonville side of the Pajaro River Bridge looking at the swollen muddy river rushing below and the closed-off, submerged town of Pajaro on the other side.

Emergency responders -- sheriff's deputies, police, county divers and boat rescue crews -- were parked along the bridge behind yellow tape.

Police and county sheriff deputies stopped both the curious from crossing, as well as a few people who said they had family members or businesses on the other side.

One man, who declined to provide his name, said his grandmother was stuck on the other side in a flooded home. The police would not let him cross but took down her address and promised to check.

Connie and Victor Alvarez, owner of Alvarez Collison and Paint, said they were trying to get in to check on their business. They said they'd been notified by Monterey County that their business was probably flooded and there was concern that toxic chemicals and solvents could be getting into the water.

As the most recent storm moved out of the region Saturday, this Central Coast community was among the hardest hit. A levee failure on the Pajaro River in Monterey County triggered massive flooding and prompted hundreds of evacuations and dozens of water rescues.

""So, we're here to check,"" said Connie Alvarez as she waited for a sheriff's deputy to check to see if she had permission to cross.

Javier Gomez, legislative analyst for Monterey County Supervisor Luis Alejo, pointed to rushing water pouring south and west along the flooded streets of Porter, San Juan and Brooklyn.

""The water is still coming in,"" he said. ""It's rising.""

Three blocks upstream, on the other side of a flooded area, three people were walking east, along the river, carrying large black plastic bags. Gomez said those were probably some of the ""hundreds"" of people who didn't heed the evacuation warnings.

Drone footage showed the extent of the flooding in the community of Pajaro, near the city of Watsonville.

Streets, cars, homes, businesses and schools were submerged.

The levee was breached about three miles east of Pajaro.

Monterey County first responders started evacuating people late Friday night. Firefighters also announced the evacuation order in Spanish since many of the roughly 1,700 residents are Spanish-speaking farm workers. Bilingual workers went door-to-door to get people out.

""(My younger brother) started to cry a little bit. My other little siblings started to cry, too. They didn't know what was going on,"" said 18-year-old evacuee Christian Garcia.

Garcia and his family were sleeping when the fire trucks woke them up.

""It didn't feel real, the sirens. Everything was in a rush,"" Garcia said.

Garcia's family and his uncle's family live in one house. They packed up quickly and left.

""At least my family is safe now. We're safe and my neighbors,"" said Isaac Martinez, who is Garcia's uncle.

Monterey County officials said the Pajaro River levee broke around midnight.

They said that, as of Saturday morning, the breach was around 100 feet wide but, by early evening, that breach had widened to 120 feet, authorities said.

Some residents could not get out in time.

California National Guard soldiers rescued dozens of people trapped in cars and homes.

""It was shocking 'cause I've never seen that,"" Martinez said.

Garcia and Martinez went back to check on their cat and their home Saturday morning. They recorded cellphone video showing their home and street, Brooklyn Street, under water. They salvaged a few items from the home and food from their fridge.

""Everything is destroyed, plants, the floor, everything is destroyed,"" Garcia said.

Garcia's former school, Pajaro Middle School, was also submerged.

""The community is just sad right now watching everything just go like that,"" Garcia said.

Garcia and Martinez's families are staying at a local shelter. They said that, given the extend of the damage, it could take months to rebuild.

""Tuesday, we're expecting a lot of rain and it's going to get worse,"" Martinez said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Spanish language'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'First responder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Firefighter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Unmanned aerial vehicle'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Agriculture'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watsonville,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Watsonville, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Watsonville, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_engine', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fire engine'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_evacuation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Emergency evacuation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Christianity'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_National_Guard', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'California National Guard'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mobile phone'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Brooklyn'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Brooklyn'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}]",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/03/12/402d0057-cea9-4c2b-8c65-388b1ff3428f/thumbnail/1200x630/b4ea7a58df4cd0e713853f9712481910/pajaro-flooded.jpg,eng-8468865,-0.06666666666666665,416290680,1,cbsnews.com,news,CBS News,"Pajaro River Levee Monterey County, California Spanish language First responder Firefighter Unmanned aerial vehicle Flood Agriculture Watsonville, California Fire engine Emergency evacuation Christianity California National Guard Mobile phone Brooklyn",United-States,USA,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,18,4,2023-03-12

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents - many of them Latino farmworkers - from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet (30.48 meters) wide. Crews had gone door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" wrote Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County board of supervisors, on Twitter.

Alejo called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.","[{'uri': 'jim_flynn@rep-am.com', 'name': 'Jim Flynn', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_(California)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Central Coast (California)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Northern California'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_river', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Atmospheric river'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Agriculture'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watsonville,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Watsonville, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Watsonville, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_National_Guard', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'California National Guard'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unincorporated_area', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Unincorporated area'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Hispanic and Latino Americans'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Alejo', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Luis Alejo'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_supervisors', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Board of supervisors'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'County (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Santa Cruz County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Santa Cruz County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}]",https://cdn.rep-am.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230311-225729-pic-41010601.jpg,eng-8468865,-0.1450980392156863,416290740,1,rep-am.com,news,Republican American,"Pajaro River Levee Central Coast (California) Northern California Flood Atmospheric river Agriculture Watsonville, California Monterey County, California California National Guard Unincorporated area Hispanic and Latino Americans Luis Alejo Board of supervisors County (United States) Twitter Santa Cruz County, California Monterey, California",United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,19,4,2023-03-12

He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. Construction was scheduled to start in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains. ""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen yearslong drought conditions. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 historical landmark was severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- in the afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide.

Crews went door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by waist-deep water.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter. He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. Construction was scheduled to start in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains. ""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen yearslong drought conditions. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 historical landmark was severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- in the afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels in the atmospheric river's aftermath. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth.

California appeared to be ""well on its way to a fourth year of drought"" before the early winter series of storms, Anderson said Friday. ""We're in a very different condition now,"" he added.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecasted an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible along the state's central coast, San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys and the southern Sierra Nevada foothills into midweek.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said.

Snow levels in the Sierra Nevada, which provides about a third of the state's water supply, are already more than 180% of the April 1 average, when it is historically at its peak. Officials reported 32 inches (81 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning at the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno, Nevada.

The snowpack at high elevations is so massive it was expected to be able to absorb the rain, but snow below 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) could start to melt, potentially contributing to flooding, forecasters said.

State water managers were also grappling with the best way to use the storms to help emerge from a severe drought. On Friday, Newsom signed an executive order making it easier for farmers and water agencies to use floodwater to refill underground aquifers. Groundwater provides on average about 41% of the state's supply each year. But many of these underground basins have been overdrawn in recent years.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide.

Crews went door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by waist-deep water.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter. He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. Construction was scheduled to start in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains. ""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen yearslong drought conditions. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 historical landmark was severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- in the afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide.

Crews went door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by waist-deep water.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter. He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. Construction was scheduled to start in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains. ""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen yearslong drought conditions. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 historical landmark was severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- in the afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said.

By NIC COURY and STEFANIE DAZIO - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- A Northern California agricultural community famous for its strawberry crop was forced to evacuate early Saturday after the Pajaro River's levee was breached by flooding from a new atmospheric river that pummeled the state.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet (30.48 meters) wide. Crews had gone door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" wrote Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on Twitter.

Alejo called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued around 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove out to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro.

""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands like Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres (1,011 hectares) of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains.

""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels in the atmospheric river's aftermath. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot (25.91 meter) eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno Count y, nearly 100 miles (160.93 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth.

California appeared to be ""well on its way to a fourth year of drought"" before the early winter series of storms, Anderson said Friday. ""We're in a very different condition now,"" he added.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecasted an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible along the state's central coast, San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys and the southern Sierra Nevada foothills into midweek.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said. Officials reported about 32 inches (81 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning at the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno, Nevada.

By NIC COURY and STEFANIE DAZIO - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- A Northern California agricultural community famous for its strawberry crop was forced to evacuate early Saturday after the Pajaro River's levee was breached by flooding from a new atmospheric river that pummeled the state.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet (30.48 meters) wide. Crews had gone door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" wrote Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on Twitter.

Alejo called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued around 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove out to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro.

""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands like Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres (1,011 hectares) of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains.

""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels in the atmospheric river's aftermath. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot (25.91 meter) eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno Count y, nearly 100 miles (160.93 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth.

California appeared to be ""well on its way to a fourth year of drought"" before the early winter series of storms, Anderson said Friday. ""We're in a very different condition now,"" he added.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecasted an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible along the state's central coast, San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys and the southern Sierra Nevada foothills into midweek.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said. Officials reported about 32 inches (81 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning at the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno, Nevada.

Dazio reported from Los Angeles.

By NIC COURY and STEFANIE DAZIO - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- A Northern California agricultural community famous for its strawberry crop was forced to evacuate early Saturday after the Pajaro River's levee was breached by flooding from a new atmospheric river that pummeled the state.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet (30.48 meters) wide. Crews had gone door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" wrote Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on Twitter.

Alejo called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued around 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove out to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro.

""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands like Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres (1,011 hectares) of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains.

""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels in the atmospheric river's aftermath. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot (25.91 meter) eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno Count y, nearly 100 miles (160.93 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth.

California appeared to be ""well on its way to a fourth year of drought"" before the early winter series of storms, Anderson said Friday. ""We're in a very different condition now,"" he added.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecasted an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible along the state's central coast, San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys and the southern Sierra Nevada foothills into midweek.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said. Officials reported about 32 inches (81 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning at the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno, Nevada.

Another atmospheric river is making its way toward storm-battered California, where residents are still contending with flooded roadways, collapsed bridges, overflowing rivers, inundated neighborhoods and a levee breach that forced hundreds to evacuate.

The new storm is expected to hit the state Monday, bringing heavy rain, mountain snow and threatening even more flooding to northern and central California just as the first atmospheric river is winding down, according to the National Weather Service. Atmospheric rivers consist of long, narrow bands of moisture that carry warm air and water vapor from the tropics.

About 15 million people remain under flood watches in California and Nevada as the storm approached early Sunday.

More flooding could make for a dire situation in some neighborhoods, where torrential walls of rain in recent days turned streets into rivers and damaged roadways, stranding people and prompting numerous rescues. At least two people have died as a result of the storms, officials said.

Among the hardest hit areas is Monterey County, where the swollen Pajaro River breached a levee at around midnight Friday, sending water gushing uncontrollably into the nearby community of Pajaro and forcing residents to flee - the ""worst case scenario"" for the community, said Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County board of supervisors.

Some people weren't able to evacuate before the floodwater arrived and crews were still out performing high-water rescues Saturday, Cal Fire Capt. Curtis Rhodes told CNN.

Many Pajaro residents are farm workers who may not only lose property, but also not be able to make a living for some time if the continued flooding impacts the agriculture, Alejo told CNN.

""These are the folks who can least afford this type of hardship,"" Alejo said.

As residents crowd emergency shelters, efforts to stop the flooding from the breach are complicated by the approach of the second atmospheric river.

""This weekend is a very brief respite,"" said David King with the National Weather Service. ""The weather will turn, expected Monday night.""

While eyes were on the Pajaro River, the Salinas River to the south was also overflowing, prompting more evacuation orders in Monterey County. The rising river water had already flooded homes and businesses around the community of San Ardo.

Emergency crews have rescued more than 90 people in Monterey County, according to Sheriff Tina Nieto. ""We even rescued a man floating down one of the areas in a tube with his pet on top of him,"" she added.

To the north, as Friday's heavy rains pummeled Santa Cruz County, about 700 residents in Soquel got trapped after a pipe failure led to severe flooding and the collapse of the one road linking the community to the rest of the region, according to Steve Wiesner, the county's assistant public works director. Residents will remain isolated until a new crossing can be created - which could take days, Wiesner said.

""We are now an island,"" resident Molly Watson told CNN.

Another hard hit area was Tulare County, where evacuation orders were expanded to include the community of Teviston as well as parts of Cutler and Exeter when river flow increased, the county sheriff's office announced Friday night. Officials urged residents to stay clear of waterways and avoid all unnecessary travel.

Video from Springville in Tulare County showed devastating damage after Friday's severe flooding.

""It's quite heartbreaking,"" Hatti Shepard told CNN. ""Many hard-working people displaced with losses of home and possessions.""

The recent atmospheric rivers - which can carry moisture thousands of miles like a fire hose - are the latest to bedevil the state after an onslaught of similar storms in December and January also resulted in deadly flooding.

Compounding the impacts of the current storms, however, is the fact that the severe rainfall is now pummeling areas already buried by heavy snowfall from the past two weeks. Melting snowpack will play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days, forecasters have said.

President Joe Biden has approved a state of emergency declaration requested by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The move frees funds for the millions of residents who have been hit with severe weather since the beginning of the year.

Meanwhile, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo expanded a state of emergency to include additional counties due to flooding associated with the same storm.

""As this severe weather continues to impact more residents across northern Nevada I again urge all Nevadans to stay safe, travel cautiously, and to follow all local guidance. State and federal partners will continue to monitor local damage and will work quickly to assess needed repairs across northern Nevada,"" Lombardo said in a statement.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide.

Crews went door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by waist-deep water.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter. He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. Construction was scheduled to start in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains. ""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen yearslong drought conditions. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 historical landmark was severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- in the afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said.

The Pajaro River's levee, which is about 100 feet wide, was breached by flooding after another atmospheric river pounded the state. Officials had warned residents to leave their homes, but some who stayed had to be rescued from flood waters.

Officials in Monterey County, where the evacuation orders were issued, said that more than 90 rescues had been completed since Friday with the help of the California National Guard. No deaths were reported.

As of Sunday morning, there were still over 6,700 customers in the county without electricity, according to the grid tracker poweroutage.us.

Authorities in San Luis Obispo County and Kern County, south of Monterey County, also ordered evacuations. President Biden declared a federal emergency late last week to help with relief efforts.

The rescue efforts in central California come as the state braces for another atmospheric river at the beginning of this week, with forecasters warning it could be worse than the one over the weekend. The Bay Area and the Central Coast are in line to receive the brunt of the next weather event.

""This event will be more widespread,"" Meteorologist Kristan Lund of the National Weather Service's Oxnard office said.

A notice on the weather service's website said that the coastal areas could expect one and a half to three inches of rain. Wind gusts could range from 20 miles per hour in most places to up to 60 miles per hour in others. The service also said travel delays are possible thanks to flooding and rockslides.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_California', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Central California'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_river', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Atmospheric river'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rain'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_National_Guard', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'California National Guard'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'County (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Joe Biden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'San Luis Obispo County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'San Luis Obispo County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kern_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kern County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kern County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_(California)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Central Coast (California)'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson's_Bay_Company"", 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': ""Hudson's Bay Company""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Meteorologist'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'National Weather Service'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Oxnard, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Oxnard, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}]",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/californiaevacuations_031223ap.jpg?strip=1&w=640,eng-8468865,0.0980392156862746,416320080,1,thehill.com,news,The Hill,"Levee Central California Pajaro River Atmospheric river Rain Monterey County, California California National Guard County (United States) Flood Joe Biden San Luis Obispo County, California Kern County, California Central Coast (California) Hudson's Bay Company Meteorologist National Weather Service Oxnard, California",United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,28,12,2023-03-12

Nearly 2,000 Pajaro residents are now under mandatory evacuation orders. With rain still falling intermittently -- and forecast to do so until at least Tuesday -- it's unclear when those evacuation orders will be lifted. A flood warning for the area is in effect until further notice.

As the sun rose in Pajaro Saturday morning, photographers captured the depth of the floodwaters. Cars and trucks are inundated up to their rooftops, homes are resting in a newly formed lake, and debris is flowing downstream. Monterey County officials have warned people in Pajaro not to drink tap water; floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said.

Aerial footage posted by California's Office of Emergency Services showed the breach in the Pajaro River levee early Saturday; overflowing river water can be seen pouring from it into the valley. Officials said the breach is about 100 feet wide.

The Pajaro Valley is known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands like Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region. Many of its residents are Latino farmworkers.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains. ""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

""The worst case scenario has sadly arrived for Pajaro. My heart hurts tonight for the families of this community,"" Monterey County Supervisor Luis Alejo told KSBW. Alejo wrote on Twitter that 1,700 residents were impacted by the incident and called on Gov. Gavin Newson and President Joe Biden for their assistance in relief efforts. ""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote.

The greater Santa Cruz and Monterey area was already reeling from heavy rains that started Thursday. Pajaro is less than 15 miles from the small town of Soquel, where rains washed away a vital road -- cutting off up to 300 residents. Over 8,000 people in the region remain under evacuation orders or warnings.

Evacuation centers are available at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds (2061 E. Lake Ave., Watsonville) and Compass Church (10325 S. Main St., Salinas).","[{'uri': 'katie_dowd@sfgate.com', 'name': 'Katie Dowd', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5,

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro, per the AP. Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide. Crews had gone door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came, but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli, and artichokes. National brands like Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region. In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. Construction was scheduled to start in 2024.

Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, called the flooding ""massive"" and said the damage will take months to repair. The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday, including the city of Watsonville. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.

He covers breaking news.

Thousands of residents were forced to evacuate in a Northern California community after a levee broke on Saturday amid yet another round of heavy rainfall to impact the Golden State, officials said.

A levee on the Pajaro River broke about three miles east of Pajaro, near the city of Watsonville, officials told local media, adding that the river's levee failed at around midnight. Photos and aerial video footage showed homes, businesses, schools, and cars submerged under several feet of water.

""My heart hurts tonight for the residents of Pajaro. We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote in a Twitter post. A flood warning for the area is still in effect, according to the National Weather Service, noting that Pajaro River flooding is impacting Monterey, San Benito, Santa Cruz, and Santa Clara counties.

More than 50 people needed to be rescued as another ""atmospheric river"" hit California, delivering more rain to the already-waterlogged state, according to the California National Guard. Some 2,000 Pajaro residents were under mandatory evacuation this weekend, a map posted by Monterey County shows.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli, and artichokes. National brands like Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

As of Sunday, there were about 6,700 customers in the county without electricity, according to data from Poweroutage.us.

In other parts of the state, officials in San Luis Obispo County and Kern County ordered evacuations due to flooding. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, declared a federal emergency due to the storms.

The atmospheric river -- known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii -- was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains. Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week.

State weather official Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth and that California appeared to be ""well on its way to a fourth year of drought"" before the early winter series of storms. ""We're in a very different condition now,"" he added, noting the heavy rain and snow in recent months.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecasted an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible along the state's central coast, San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys, and the southern Sierra Nevada foothills into midweek.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}},

The National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for the San Francisco Bay Area ""[f]rom Monday evening through late Tuesday night"" as yet another such ""river"" is on the way, with little break in between the storms.

The flooding, as captured in images and drone footage by the San Francisco Chronicle, highlights the unique vulnerability of the Santa Cruz mountains to this year's flooding, which came after predictions of a dry winter.

The Chronicle notes:

The Santa Cruz Mountains, which have certainly lived up to their reputation for rain, have taken the hit this winter because of both the distinct weather and the area's enduring geography.

The orientation of the mountains, facing west to southwest, means they're struck head-on by storm cells off the Pacific Ocean, which generally move from southwest to northeast. The relatively steep and lofty terrain also boosts the orographic lift, or the movement of air up the slopes, resulting in greater cloud formation and precipitation.","[{'uri': 'joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com', 'name': 'Joel B.

(AP) -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward and makes way for another onslaught of rain and snow that could yet again pummel the beleaguered region as soon as Monday night.

The National Weather Service said the next torrent could exacerbate the severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in the past few days, including a levee failure that prompted widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's Central Coast.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

The next weather system does not appear to be as powerful as the last one, but weather officials nevertheless cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur in lower elevations from additional rain and snowmelt that could swell creeks and streams.

The rain and snow is expected to extend from Central California to Oregon, as well as northern Nevada.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, the chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot (25.91 meter) eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

(AP) -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward and makes way for another onslaught of rain and snow that could yet again pummel the beleaguered region as soon as Monday night.

The National Weather Service said the next torrent could exacerbate the severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in the past few days, including a levee failure that prompted widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's Central Coast.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

The next weather system does not appear to be as powerful as the last one, but weather officials nevertheless cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur in lower elevations from additional rain and snowmelt that could swell creeks and streams.

While there are scattered showers expected throughout the day Sunday, the weather service said the next storm system will arrive Monday night into early Tuesday morning. It will bring gusty south/southeast winds and more moderate to heavy rain. The region could see more wind gusts toppling vulnerable trees and power lines with the soils already extremely saturated.

There will be another break in the weather Wednesday evening into Friday when another system looks to move in Friday morning, the weather service said.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, the chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type':

Yet another atomopheric river will bring new flood concerns to Northern California beginning Monday and continuing through Tuesday night.

Southern California will see rain Tuesday and Wednesday, with flooding possible in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, according to the National Weather Service.

""This next atmospheric river event is not looking like it's going to be as strong, but when you have a flood on top of a flood, it just makes a bigger flood,"" said Cindy Kobold, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. ""That means this next one could be more impactful, because the ground is way overly saturated, and we're going to have additional rainfall, with gusty winds.""

A levee failure on the Pajaro River - three miles upstream from the town of Pajaro - triggered massive flooding in and around the town and prompted hundreds of evacuations.

The levee breached late Friday night, said Nicholas Pasculli, a Monterey County spokesperson. Patrols noticed ""bubbling up in the adjacent farmland"" at 11 p.m., the first sign of trouble.

Thirty minutes later, the levee failed, Pasculli said. As of Saturday morning, he said, ""the failure is approximately 100 feet wide."" Pajaro -- with a population of 1,700, mostly farmworkers -- is underwater.

Andres Garcia, 39, said this was his third evacuation from Pajaro because of the flooding river; in addition to January, there was one in 1995, when the town was flooded ""even worse"" than it is now.

He and his wife and 8-year-old daughter left the city early Saturday, after they got a knock on the door from a sheriff's deputy who urged them to evacuate. Garcia said they left before the water got too high, and he had no idea about the condition of his house.

His neighbor Laura Garcia left after dawn. She showed a video of water sloshing through her house -- lapping against a crib, dining room set and shelves.

Andres Garcia said many farmworkers will be out of a job for as long as the water stays high and fields are submerged.

""They can't do anything while it's like this,"" he said.

Elsewhere in Monterey County, the Salinas River flooded around the community of San Ardo, prompting evacuation orders Friday night.

Major flooding was reported in Tulare County's Springville area -- where officials conducted dozens of water rescues Friday morning -- and in Kernville, where the roaring Kern River surrounded houses and mobile homes, spurring evacuations.

Valeriana López, a 55-year-old resident of Tooleville in Tulare County, said the floodwater didn't come inside her home but turned her yard into soft mud. She set down boards to get across the yard and was searching for sandbags to create a walkway.

Sheriff's deputies went door to door Friday night urging residents to be ready to leave, López said. But she chose to stay.

""I'm going to trust in God, because we can't do anything,"" she said. ""We don't have anywhere to go.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri':

An atmospheric river, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration compares to a ""river in the sky,"" has poured down on California, forcing thousands to evacuate.

The extreme weather caused the Pajaro River's levee to breach, leading to 8,500 evacuation orders in Monterey County on the Pacific coast.

The California Governor's Office for Emergency Services states that an evacuation order is ""mandatory"" and an ""official order to leave,"" as the conditions are considered a threat to life.

According to AP, evacuation officials had called on homes on Friday to encourage residents to evacuate. They had to pull some of those who refused from floodwaters on Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard had to save over 50 people overnight from the water overnight, AP reports.

At least two people died on Friday as a result of the harsh weather conditions, with one person being killed after a portion of the roof collapsed at an Oakland warehouse, according to the LA Times.

But the worst isn't yet over. Approximately 15 million people are under flood watches in California and Nevada as a second ""river in the sky"" approaches, CNN reports.

The National Weather Service has said that the worst of the storm is predicted to come late on Monday through to early Tuesday, although heavy rainfall has already seen thousands be given evacuation orders.

Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet wide.

Crews went door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.

First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by waist-deep water.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter. He called the flooding ""massive,"" saying the damage will take months to repair.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday.

Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued about 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.

""I'm kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom's car was left in the water.""

Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents -- along with their dog, Mila -- arrived at the shelter about an hour later.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro. ""Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,"" the governor's office wrote on Twitter.

The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands including Driscoll's Strawberries and Martinelli's are headquartered in the region.

In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. Construction was scheduled to start in 2024.

State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains. ""It's tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,"" he said.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen yearslong drought conditions. State reservoirs are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 historical landmark was severely damaged and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- in the afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles south of Gold Country. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Yet another atmospheric river is in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third and possibly a fourth appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific.

The National Weather Service on Saturday forecast an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible.

Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said.

By NIC COURY and STEFANIE DAZIO - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward and makes way for another onslaught of rain and snow -- accompanied by strong gusts -- that could yet again pummel the beleaguered region as soon as Monday night.

The National Weather Service said the next torrent could exacerbate the severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in the past few days, including a levee failure that prompted widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's Central Coast.

The next weather system is not expected to bring as much rain, but weather officials nevertheless cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur in lower elevations from additional rain and snowmelt that could swell creeks and streams.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts even today,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said Sunday.

The rain and snow is expected to extend from Central California to Oregon, as well as northern Nevada.

Of particular concern are the strong winds that are expected to accompany the approaching weather system. NWS is predicting wind gusts of up to 50 mph (81 kph) in some places -- which could potentially snap tree branches and damage power lines.

Fortunately, the new storm is a fast-moving one which means it won't have time to dump as much rain.

As much as a foot of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, according to weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, the chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot (25.91 meter) eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region.

Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts even today,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said Sunday.

The rain and snow is expected to extend from Central California to Oregon, as well as northern Nevada.

Of particular concern are the strong winds that are expected to accompany the approaching weather system. NWS is predicting wind gusts of up to 50 mph (81 kph) in some places -- which could potentially snap tree branches and damage power lines.

Fortunately, the new storm is a fast-moving one which means it won't have time to dump as much rain.

As much as a foot of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, according to weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, the chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot (25.91 meter) eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region.

Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

(AP) -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward and makes way for another onslaught of rain and snow -- accompanied by strong gusts -- that could yet again pummel the beleaguered region as soon as Monday night.

The National Weather Service said the next torrent could exacerbate the severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in the past few days, including a levee failure that prompted widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's Central Coast.

WATCH: Atmospheric river hits portions of California, compounding weather woes

The next weather system is not expected to bring as much rain, but weather officials nevertheless cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur in lower elevations from additional rain and snowmelt that could swell creeks and streams.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts even today,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said Sunday.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, the chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region's wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water.

Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

In San Francisco, an 85-foot (25.91 meter) eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.

Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area -- the heart of California's Gold Rush -- on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning -- later canceled -- for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region.

Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno County, nearly 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.

The levee breach on Friday, which has flooded farmland surrounding the town of Pajaro, comes as another atmospheric river is forecast to hit California on Monday following days of rain. The National Weather Service has put the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast under a flood watch from Monday night through Wednesday morning, warning of widespread flooding and rapidly rising creeks, streams and rivers.

The forecast calls for three to six inches of rain to fall in the region's hills with valley areas receiving one to three inches of precipitation. Some mountain area could be hit with as much as eight inches of rain.

Residents were forced to evacuate in the middle of the night after an atmospheric river surge broke the Pajaro Levee and sent flood waters flowing into the community.

California has been inundated with intense rainfall since Friday, causing widespread flooding and mudslides. Though the rain dwindled Sunday, the state is bracing for another atmospheric river expected to make landfall as soon as Monday night.

That is forecast to bring more rain and snow -- and more flooding -- through Wednesday.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has proclaimed a state of emergency in 21 counties, and President Biden has also approved his request for federal assistance.

Officials said at least two people died in recent severe weather in the state. A spokesperson for the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services said Sunday that the agency hasn't received any notification of fatalities from local officials for the current round of storms so far.

The rain from the atmospheric river that made landfall Thursday flooded roads and rivers, and thousands of residents were under evacuation orders. A river levee in central California breached just before midnight Friday, forcing hundreds of evacuations and dozens of rescues as the small Monterey County town of Pajaro found itself completely underwater.

""There are about 1,700 people displaced from their homes in Pajaro, and the town is inundated with water throughout,"" Monterey County Communications Director Nick Pasculli told NPR.

Atmospheric rivers form when a long channel of wind transports water vapor from the tropics, and they produce heavy rain or snow when they make landfall.

As of Sunday afternoon, about 13,000 California customers were without power, according to the outage tracking site PowerOutage.us -- down from 37,000 Saturday afternoon.

The outages are concentrated in hard-hit Monterey County, which saw about 13 inches of rain and the devastating Pajaro levee breach. The Bay Area in northern California was hit with about 10 inches of rain.

Starting late Monday through early Wednesday, the next atmospheric river ""is likely to produce additional very heavy rainfall,"" especially in northern and central California, and ""very heavy mountain snowfall and periods of strong winds,"" said David Lawrence, a National Weather Service meteorologist.

That could worsen the already severe flooding. In addition to flash flooding, the extra rain and snowmelt could cause streams and rivers to overflow in lower elevations throughout central and northern California.

The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services urged residents to clear their drains and gutters, check roads online before traveling and be ready to evacuate if notified to do so.

In anticipation of the storms headed for the state into this week, the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services has prepositioned flood fighting personnel.

The state is currently under a Flash Flood Watch as another atmospheric river is expected to hit the area.

On Friday, a State of Emergency was declared in at least 34 counties in California as the towns of Springville and Porterville were hit by a dire Flash Flood Emergency. Spotters reported up to 3 inches of rain due to the rapid snow melt.

In Monterey County, a Flash Flood Warning was issued for Pajaro on Saturday morning along the Pajaro River, after heavy rainfall caused a levee to fail and heavily flood the community which quickly led to evacuations. The National Guard and first responders are assisting with evacuations, with some individuals having to go through floodwaters in order to reach safety.

A drone video recorded the flooding of several homes located in Tulare County, causing evacuations. Brandon Clement, a storm tracker for Live Storms Media, captured footage of floodwaters engulfing several homes, and even tearing one house from its foundation.

Flash flooding prompted authorities to issue evacuation orders for certain areas of Kern County this weekend, including the city of Bakersfield in the state's Central Valley region.

On Friday, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park shared a video that depicted the flooded fields reaching the roads in Three Rivers, California.

Furthermore, the Tulare County Sheriff's Office ordered several evacuations for Three Rivers, advising residents to stay away from flooded roads.

By NIC COURY and STEFANIE DAZIO - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward, and as a new system threatens the region with another onslaught of rain, snow and gusting winds as soon as Monday night.

The National Weather Service said the next torrent could exacerbate the severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in recent days, causing a levee failure that prompted widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's Central Coast.

The next system is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur in lower elevations from additional rain and snowmelt that could swell creeks and streams.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts even today,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

The rain and snow is expected to extend from Central California to Oregon, as well as northern Nevada.

Of particular concern are the expected strong winds. The weather service is predicting wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) in some places -- which could potentially snap tree branches and damage power lines.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the past two days, more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and the new system is expected to pack even more. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average -- the highest amount of snowfall in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding as the new storm rolls in.

The flooding has impacted drinking water facilities in Pajaro. Officials said residents should not drink tap water for cooking or drinking until further notice.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, moving to expedite more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working along the river's levee system in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with periodic signs of significant trouble. In the 1990s the levee was breached several times, prompting flooding that led to evacuations and disaster declarations. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is slated to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

According to Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto, 1,700 people are displaced from the Pajaro area and more than 90 rescues have been performed.

""We're still conducting (water rescues) now as we're speaking today,"" Nieto said during a news conference Saturday afternoon, adding no deaths or injuries have been reported so far.

According to Lew Bauman, interim general manager of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency, the river breached a portion near river mile 10. It's approximately a 120-foot breach.

""It will flow uncontrolled until we are able to secure that with interim protective measures,"" he said during the news conference. ""The State of California Department of Water Resources is currently en route with their contractor to formulate a mitigation plan that will require not only access but appropriate materials and construction technologies to close that breach. Until then, there will be continued flows and the appropriate emergency response.""

Bauman said the levee experienced boils and overtopping locations, as it did during January's storms, on the Santa Cruz side and the Monterey side. He said the cause of failure in the levee is yet to be fully determined.

""It's been crazy,"" said Pajaro resident Juan Ceja. ""It has left me in shock to be honest because this is the first time I've ever lived through something like this and I never thought it could happen. Last night, around 1 a.m., we heard sirens going off and my uncle came in to get me, so I just grabbed as much of my stuff that I could and we dipped out.""

Monterey County Supervisor Luis Alejo and Santa Cruz County Supervisor Felipe Hernandez along with volunteers from Casa La Cultura went door to door in Pajaro Friday afternoon into the evening to speak with residents under evacuation orders to share information about evacuation locations and services.

First responders, law enforcement, firefighters and the California National Guard helped community members evacuate the flood zone during the night and into the morning and afternoon, but many residents chose to stay in the area, with some making the best of the disaster, riding bikes through puddles and exploring the area, as National Guard trucks forded the flooded streets and drones flew overhead, searching for those in immediate danger.

Some Pajaro residents, such as Miguel Sepulveda, who lived through a similar flood event in Pajaro in 1995, chose not to evacuate the area with the rest of his family because he feared that if he left his vehicle and home unattended, looters may move in and steal his belongings.

""There were troublemakers that came and did this the first time, about a month ago,"" said Sepulveda, who was with his son, Esteban. ""The cops are doing a great job right now, but the trouble comes at night.""

Other longtime residents that decided not to evacuate the community mentioned the flooding that happened in the winter of 1995, such as Jose Rocha, who was taking refuge with his family in a relative's third-floor apartment.

""I woke up and had the same reaction I did in '95,"" said Rocha. ""It was a little bit different then though because I was my son's age and I didn't always realize the danger we were in. Now, the first thing I thought about was protecting my family. I hope the river doesn't rise anymore, but we'll have to wait and see.""

According to meteorologist David King with the National Weather Service, this weekend is a very brief respite from the stormy weather. He said another atmospheric river storm is forecast to arrive Monday night.

""The confidence (in the forecast) has already grown so we've issued a flood watch for this atmospheric river as well as a high wind watch for this atmospheric river,"" he said during the news conference. ""Those watches begin Monday at 10 p.m. and go all the way through Wednesday at 4 a.m.""

King said that given the close proximity to the previous storm, the ground is incredibly saturated.

""It will not take much to knock down trees and cause power outages,"" he said. ""Flooding is expected. If you come across flooded roadways please remember, turn around don't drown.""

Pajaro residents such as Isiah and Alfonso Robledo, who were out exploring the perimeter of the flooded neighborhood, were also taking temporary refuge at one of their relative's homes that wasn't flooded during the night.

""We are at our uncle's house right now,"" said Isiah Robledo. ""We'll probably stay there and come back and check on our things. We just hope this all goes away soon.""

Some residents that decided to stay had homes on high ground, such as Matthew Quintero, who was checking out the height of the Pajaro River with his son, Julian, Saturday afternoon.

""It's been stressful,"" said Matthew Quintero. ""Our hopes are that the city workers and police officers get everything sorted out and the water goes down. Until then, we just have to wait it out.""

Monterey County warned residents in Pajaro to not use tap water to drink or to cook because the wells were flooded and the water may be contaminated with chemicals that will remain after boiling or disinfection.

The Pajaro Valley Unified School District said staff placed sandbags at Pajaro Middle School and prepared the campus for the flood but its status is unknown. The district is planning to reopen the school at an alternate site if needed.

Sister Rosa Dolores Rodriguez, founder of the Casa de la Cultura Center in Pajaro, stood on the Pajaro River Bridge, cut off from her center, watching law enforcement and first responders at work. She vividly recalled the flooding that happened there in March 1995 and pointed out that the road to recovery would not be easy.

""There's a certain stress or worry that comes when you are waiting to see if it's going to flood or not,"" said Rodriguez. ""Now that it flooded, we have to worry about the recovery period, the people and their houses and cars. And I think the recovery is going to be quite difficult.""

Displaced families waited along the bridge for transport to shelters. The closest shelter to Pajaro is at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds at 2601 East Lake Ave. in Watsonville.

Nieto said during the conference that people can bring displaced pets to the bridge at 1 Main St. in Watsonville, where officials from SPCA Monterey County can help.",[],"[{'uri':

The National Weather Service said the next torrent could exacerbate the severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in recent days, causing a levee failure that prompted widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's Central Coast.

The next system is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur in lower elevations from additional rain and snowmelt that could swell creeks and streams.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts even today,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

The rain and snow is expected to extend from Central California to Oregon, as well as northern Nevada.

Of particular concern are the expected strong winds. The weather service is predicting wind gusts of up to 50 mph in some places -- which could potentially snap tree branches and damage power lines.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the past two days, more than 20 inches of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and the new system is expected to pack even more. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average -- the highest amount of snowfall in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding as the new storm rolls in.

The flooding has impacted drinking water facilities in Pajaro. Officials said residents should not drink tap water for cooking or drinking until further notice.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, moving to expedite more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working along the river's levee system in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with periodic signs of significant trouble. In the 1990s the levee was breached several times, prompting flooding that led to evacuations and disaster declarations. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is slated to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri':

California is bracing for another round of storms as residents deal with blocked exit routes, high floodwaters, a levee break, emergency rescues, and ongoing evacuations, multiple outlets reported.

""My heart hurts tonight for the residents of Pajaro,"" Monterey County Board of Supervisors Chair Luis Alejo tweeted Saturday.

A levee failure on California's Pajaro River in Monterey County Friday night caused massive flooding necessitating evacuations and ""dozens of water rescues,"" the Los Angeles Times reported.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived,"" Alejo said, also thanking the first responders and county staff assisting with evacuations and relocations to safe shelters.

More than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday in Monterey County. Those under the orders and warnings include the unincorporated agricultural community of Pajaro, which is home to many Spanish-speaking farm workers, KPIX reported.

Streets, cars, homes, businesses, and schools were submerged, the outlet also reported.

Sunday afternoon, Alejo warned residents not to drink the tap water nor use it for cooking. Officials are concerned that flood water entering into the well casing may have contaminated tap water with chemicals. Boiling the water, he warned, will not make it safe.

Soldiers in the California National Guard worked to support first responders in 56 rescues near the Panjaro River, the Guard tweeted yesterday. In the video accompanying the tweet, a guardsman assists a driver as the driver exits his vehicle into the thigh-deep waters flooding the road.

Northern California residents will face more bad weather, as forecasters warn that yet another atmospheric river is bearing down on the region. Beleaguered residents should expect more heavy rain and gusty winds that could exacerbate the flooding as early as Monday.

An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that transports water vapor, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration explains. The vapor columns, like ""rivers in the sky,"" move with the weather. Those with the largest amounts of water vapor and strongest winds can create extreme rainfall and floods, NOAA also explains.

California's Governor's Office of Emergency Services tweeted Sunday that flood fighting personnel are being pre-positioned across the state as they prepare for the predicted onslaught. Cal OES urged the public to have emergency plan in place, emergency preparedness kits at home, and vehicles fueled in case evacuation becomes necessary.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Alejo', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Luis Alejo'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County_Board_of_Supervisors', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County Board of Supervisors'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'First responder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Los Angeles Times'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_National_Guard', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'California National Guard'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unincorporated_area', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Unincorporated area'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Spanish language'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'County (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPIX-TV', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'KPIX-TV'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Agriculture'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Governor's_Office_of_Emergency_Services"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': ""California Governor's Office of Emergency Services""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Vapor'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Emergency management'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Northern California'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Water vapor'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_river', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Atmospheric river'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rain'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Atmosphere'}}]",https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zMzI2MTI3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY5ODgyOTEyM30.LVmE4ws4MEskz2GiuykIPdne14XXl0p2SMp2f96oI08/img.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C171,eng-8468865,-0.2156862745098039,416350140,1,theblaze.com,news,TheBlaze,"Luis Alejo Pajaro River Levee California Monterey County, California Monterey County Board of Supervisors First responder Los Angeles Times Flood Twitter California National Guard Unincorporated area Spanish language County (United States) KPIX-TV Agriculture California Governor's Office of Emergency Services Vapor Emergency management National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Northern California Water vapor River Atmospheric river Rain Atmosphere",United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,49,20,2023-03-12

The National Weather Service said the next torrent could exacerbate the severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in recent days, causing a levee failure that prompted widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's Central Coast.

The next system is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur in lower elevations from additional rain and snowmelt that could swell creeks and streams.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts even today,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

The rain and snow is expected to extend from Central California to Oregon, as well as northern Nevada.

Of particular concern are the expected strong winds. The weather service is predicting wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) in some places -- which could potentially snap tree branches and damage power lines.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the past two days, more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and the new system is expected to pack even more. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average -- the highest amount of snowfall in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding as the new storm rolls in.

The flooding has impacted drinking water facilities in Pajaro. Officials said residents should not drink tap water for cooking or drinking until further notice.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, moving to expedite more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working along the river's levee system in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with periodic signs of significant trouble. In the 1990s the levee was breached several times, prompting flooding that led to evacuations and disaster declarations. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is slated to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.","[{'uri': 'associated_press@columbian.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type':

A 19-year resident of Pajaro, Equihua, a strawberry picker, was among the thousands wondering what to do after a levee along the Pajaro River breached and caused massive flooding to the unincorporated Monterey County town.

The town is composed largely of farmworkers, and those who work the fields don't know what's in store for their ability to live and to work.

""It's very ugly,"" she said. ""What am I supposed to do now? Where am I supposed to work? Where am I supposed to go? It's very calm right now, but I'm worried.""

Worry was understating it Sunday. Even amid flooding that closed a stretch of Highway 1 from Salinas Road to Highway 129, a second atmospheric river bore down on the region and Monterey County in particular. It threatens occasional rain Sunday and much of Monday before the real wave hits late Monday into Tuesday.

It's the last thing needed for a community that ""is underwater,"" Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said.

""We've evacuated about 2,000 people,"" Nieto said. ""Our public safety (personnel) has done over 200 evacuations in high-water vehicles and boats."" She added that authorities have rescued more than 200 people.

There have been no reports of injuries or deaths, authorities said.

The Monterey County Office of Emergency Services announced the full closure Highway 1 about 9:15 a.m. Sunday. It was the latest hardship for an area that saw evacuation shelters continuing to fill following a breach in the levee.

Flood waters continued to cover most of downtown Pajaro on Sunday morning. Army national guard trucks and humvees waded through storm waters on Main Street, a ghost town now with nothing but flooded-out cars, sandbags and residents still trapped behind the water line.

""It's really sad to see the town like this,"" said Margarito Rincon. ""But there's nothing you can do against nature.""

A 19-year resident of Pajaro, Equihua, a strawberry picker, was among the thousands wondering what to do after a levee along the Pajaro River breached and caused massive flooding to the unincorporated Monterey County town.

The town is composed largely of farmworkers, and those who work the fields don't know what's in store for their ability to live and to work.

""It's very ugly,"" she said. ""What am I supposed to do now? Where am I supposed to work? Where am I supposed to go? It's very calm right now, but I'm worried.""

Worry was understating it Sunday. Even amid flooding that closed a stretch of Highway 1 from Salinas Road to Highway 129, a second atmospheric river bore down on the region and Monterey County in particular. It threatens occasional rain Sunday and much of Monday before the real wave hits late Monday into Tuesday.

It's the last thing needed for a community that ""is underwater,"" Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said.

""We've evacuated about 2,000 people,"" Nieto said. ""Our public safety (personnel) has done over 200 evacuations in high-water vehicles and boats."" She added that authorities have rescued more than 200 people.

There have been no reports of injuries or deaths, authorities said.

The Monterey County Office of Emergency Services announced the full closure Highway 1 about 9:15 a.m. Sunday. It was the latest hardship for an area that saw evacuation shelters continuing to fill following a breach in the levee.

Flood waters continued to cover most of downtown Pajaro on Sunday morning. Army national guard trucks and humvees waded through storm waters on Main Street, a ghost town now with nothing but flooded-out cars, sandbags and residents still trapped behind the water line.

""It's really sad to see the town like this,"" said Margarito Rincon. ""But there's nothing you can do against nature.""

(AP) -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward, while a new storm threatened the region with another onslaught of rain, snow and gusting winds as soon as Monday.

The National Weather Service said the next system could exacerbate severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in recent days, causing a levee failure and widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's central coast.

The new storm is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur at lower elevations from additional rain and creeks and streams swollen with snowmelt.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

A tornado briefly touched down in Tuolumne County during severe thunderstorms Saturday that also dumped an inch (2.5 centimeters) of hail, the weather service office in Sacramento said. Tornadoes were possible again Sunday afternoon, forecasters warned.

The rain and snow incoming Monday is expected to extend from central California to Oregon and northern Nevada. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) are expected in some places and could damage power lines and snap tree branches.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the past two days, more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and more is expected. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average, and the highest in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working to shore up parts of the river's levee system when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

More than 9,000 California residents were under evacuation orders Friday as a new atmospheric river brought heavy rain, thunderstorms and strong winds, swelling rivers and creeks and flooding several major highways during the morning commute.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward, while a new storm threatened the region with another onslaught of rain, snow and gusting winds as soon as Monday.

The National Weather Service said the next system could exacerbate severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in recent days, causing a levee failure and widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's central coast.

The new storm is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur at lower elevations from additional rain and creeks and streams swollen with snowmelt.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

A tornado briefly touched down in Tuolumne County during severe thunderstorms Saturday that also dumped an inch (2.5 centimeters) of hail, the weather service office in Sacramento said. Tornadoes were possible again Sunday afternoon, forecasters warned.

The rain and snow incoming Monday is expected to extend from central California to Oregon and northern Nevada. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) are expected in some places and could damage power lines and snap tree branches.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the past two days, more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and more is expected. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average, and the highest in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working to shore up parts of the river's levee system when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward, while a new storm threatened the region with another onslaught of rain, snow and gusting winds as soon as Monday.

The National Weather Service said the next system could exacerbate severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in recent days, causing a levee failure and widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's central coast.

The new storm is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur at lower elevations from additional rain and creeks and streams swollen with snowmelt.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

A tornado briefly touched down in Tuolumne County during severe thunderstorms Saturday that also dumped an inch (2.5 centimeters) of hail, the weather service office in Sacramento said. Tornadoes were possible again Sunday afternoon, forecasters warned.

The rain and snow incoming Monday is expected to extend from central California to Oregon and northern Nevada. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) are expected in some places and could damage power lines and snap tree branches.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the past two days, more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and more is expected. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average, and the highest in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working to shore up parts of the river's levee system when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

In some parts of Pajaro, water levels are rising.

The Monterey County Sheriff's Office said they have evacuated about 2,000 people from Pajaro since the Pajaro River levee broke early Saturday morning.

But some people are refusing to leave, fearing more than just the floodwaters.

""If the lights go out, the gas is gone, that's when we'll probably leave ... Yeah, everything is still on,"" said 15-year-old Carlos, who declined to provide his last name.

He and his family live on the second floor of an apartment complex. Their unit is dry but the complex is surrounded by water.

""My parents were concerned about me and my siblings and possibly the robbers would get into the houses. That's what they're mostly concerned about,"" Carlos said.

He said looters came to the community during the last evacuation in January.

Carlos said that, like many families in Pajaro, his parents are farmworkers with little money. They want to protect the little they have.

""We're OK, we have lots of food,"" Carlos said.

Another family that tried to stick it out decided there was nothing left to protect.

Fifteen-year-old Angel Escutia and his father Juan Escutia got on a Monterey County sheriff's rescue boat Sunday afternoon.

""When we left the house, (the water) was all the way up to our waist,"" Escutia said.

Escutia said the water destroyed everything in the house and three family cars parked outside.

""We just decided to stay so (looters) wouldn't take our stuff. We thought the water would go down this morning but, this morning, we started to notice it was going more up, it was getting deeper,"" Escutia said.

They salvaged a few bags of clothes and a few pairs of shoes. Even though they lost everything, they still have each other and their dog Lucky.

""I'm glad we got out safe,"" Escutia said.

Authorities were urging people to leave since water was still rising.

""Looting should not be an issue at this time. In fact, we've actually seen some of the neighbors that are really going out of their way to help people out that are not able to get back in. They're going in and securing people's residences, securing some belongings for people, medications, maybe family heirlooms and stuff like that,"" said Cal Fire captain Curtis Rhodes.

Authorities said almost every part of Pajaro is under water. Some streets are several feet deep. Homes, businesses and schools were submerged.

Monterey County officials said that, once they get a break from the storms, they plan to use rocks and other material to plug the levee breach about three miles east of Pajaro.

Not only is Pajaro under water, nearby Highway 1 was also flooded. Authorities said they don't know when they can reopen it.

""We can rebuild this, clean up the streets and be back to normal,"" Carlos said.

There have been no reported injuries as of early Sunday evening.

Authorities have set up four emergency shelters for evacuees.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Looting'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County_Sheriff's_Office"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Monterey County Sheriff's Office""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmworker', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Farmworker'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Forestry_and_Fire_Protection', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'California State Route 1'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_shelter', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Emergency shelter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rhodes'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Rhodes'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Greece'}}}}]",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/03/13/c3b472cd-0121-4fdb-8222-ec236fc248d0/thumbnail/1200x630/f2a33366337e05c55dd667d6015f39dc/pajaro-streetflood.jpg,eng-8468865,-0.1450980392156863,416371200,1,cbsnews.com,news,CBS News,"Pajaro River Looting Monterey County, California Monterey County Sheriff's Office Levee Flood Farmworker Captain (United States) California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection California State Route 1 Emergency shelter Rhodes",United-States,USA,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,40,2,2023-03-13

SAN DIEGO -- At least eight people were killed when two migrant smuggling boats capsized in shallow but treacherous surf amid heavy fog, authorities said Sunday, marking one of the deadliest maritime human smuggling operations ever off of U.S. shores.

A Spanish-speaking woman on one of the panga-style boats called 911 Saturday night to report the other vessel overturned in waves at Black's Beach, authorities said. She said there were 15 people on the capsized vessel and eight on hers.

Coast Guard and San Diego Fire-Rescue crews pulled bodies of eight adults from the water, but fog hampered the search for additional victims. Recovery efforts resumed Sunday but no additional bodies were found.

Survivors may have escaped on land, including the woman who called 911. Authorities did not know her whereabouts.

Oil giant Saudi Aramco makes a historic $161B profit in 2022

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Aramco reported Sunday earning $161 billion last year, claiming the highest-ever recorded annual profit by a publicly listed company and drawing immediate criticism from activists.

The monster profit by the firm, known formally as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., came off the back of energy prices rising after Russia launched its war on Ukraine in February 2022, with sanctions limiting the sale of Moscow's oil and natural gas in Western markets.

Aramco also hopes to increase its production to take advantage of market demand as China reenters the global market after lifting its coronavirus restrictions.

As atmospheric river exits, a new storm threatens California

WATSONVILLE, Calif. -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward, while a new storm threatened another onslaught of rain, snow and gusting winds as soon as Monday.

The new storm is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters warned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur at lower elevations from additional rain and creeks and streams swollen with snowmelt. Monday's incoming rain and snow is expected to extend from central California to Oregon and northern Nevada.

Wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) are expected in some places and could damage power lines and snap tree branches.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the past two days, more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and more is expected. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average, and the highest in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working to shore up parts of the river's levee system when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward, while a new storm threatened another onslaught of rain, snow and gusting winds as soon as Monday.

The National Weather Service said the next system could exacerbate severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in recent days, prompting a levee failure and widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's central coast.

The new storm is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters warned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur at lower elevations from additional rain and creeks and streams swollen with snowmelt.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

A tornado briefly touched down in Tuolumne County during severe thunderstorms Saturday that also dumped an inch (2.5 centimeters) of hail, the weather service office in Sacramento said. Tornadoes were possible again Sunday afternoon, forecasters warned.

Monday's incoming rain and snow is expected to extend from central California to Oregon and northern Nevada. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) are expected in some places and could damage power lines and snap tree branches.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Crews assess storm damage, which washed out North Main Street in Soquel, Calif., Friday, March 10, 2023.

Sunday, March 12, 2023 | 9:07 p.m.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. -- Wet, miserable weather continued across huge swaths of California on Sunday as an atmospheric river that caused major flooding flowed eastward, while a new storm threatened another onslaught of rain, snow and gusting winds as soon as Monday.

The National Weather Service said the next system could exacerbate severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in recent days, prompting a levee failure and widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's central coast.

The new storm is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters warned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur at lower elevations from additional rain and creeks and streams swollen with snowmelt.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

A tornado briefly touched down in Tuolumne County during severe thunderstorms Saturday that also dumped an inch (2.5 centimeters) of hail, the weather service office in Sacramento said. Tornadoes were possible again Sunday afternoon, forecasters warned.

Monday's incoming rain and snow is expected to extend from central California to Oregon and northern Nevada. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) are expected in some places and could damage power lines and snap tree branches.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the past two days, more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and more is expected. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average, and the highest in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working to shore up parts of the river's levee system when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.","[{'uri': 'associated_press@lasvegassun.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type':

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning. President Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working to shore up parts of the river's levee system when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

The past week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

Still reeling from storms that inundated neighborhoods, forced rescues and damaged roads, storm-battered California is bracing for another atmospheric river that threatens even more flooding Monday.

More than 17 million people remained under flood watches across California and Nevada early Monday morning as the storm made its menacing approach - the 11th atmospheric river to hit the West this winter season.

The new storm, arriving on the heels of another atmospheric river, could exacerbate the flooding and damage in some areas. Already, those in the central and northern parts of California are crowding into shelters and contending with flooded neighborhoods, mudslides, dangerous rushing rivers, collapsed bridges and unusable roads.

At least two people have died as a result of the storms, officials said.

This atmospheric river event will first bring rain and snow to much of Oregon and Washington before sinking south into California Monday. Rainfall totals up to 8 inches are possible across parts of northern and central California.

The approaching atmospheric river is already complicating efforts to repair a levee breach that happened around midnight Friday on the swollen Pajaro River in Monterey County, one of the hardest hit areas in the state.

Water rushed uncontrollably through the more than 120-foot break and into nearby Pajaro, forcing thousands to flee as crews performed high-water rescues in the flooded area.

There have already been close to 200 rescues due to flooding in the area, Monterey Sheriff Tina Nieto said.

Many Pajaro residents are farm workers who may not only lose property, but also the ability to earn a living for some time if the continued flooding impacts agriculture, said Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County board of supervisors.

""These are the folks who can least afford this type of hardship,"" he said.

With more rain on the way, Monterey County officials are now looking into expanding evacuation orders in and around the Pajaro River, where more than 5,000 residents already have been impacted by evacuation warnings and orders.

More than 480 people are at 30 shelters across 12 counties, the majority in hard-hit Santa Cruz County, just north of the Monterey area, according to a Sunday update from the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

President Joe Biden has approved a state of emergency declaration requested by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The move frees funds for the millions of residents who have been hit with severe weather since the beginning of the year.

Newsom on Sunday expanded the declaration to include six additional counties, including Calaveras, Del Norte, Glenn, Kings, San Benito and San Joaquin.

Images from throughout the state show neighborhoods that look like lakes from the severe rainfall that pummeled California over the past few days and sent rivers and creeks overflowing.

The Salinas River is already rising as it moves through the Salinas Valley and Monterey County officials warn it will feel the impacts of our next atmospheric river storm event.""

California Highway Patrol used a helicopter to help rescue someone who was trapped in the Salinas River in King City, the agency said in a Facebook post.

""The rising river washed a driver and his car away but the driver was able to escape the vehicle and get to an island in the middle of the flooded Salinas River,"" the post said.

Similar rescues have played out throughout the state, with California National Guard troops also responding with highwater vehicles to help people stuck in floodwaters.

In parts of Kern County - where several evacuation orders remain - the flooding was so bad that one resident described seeing a shed, a hot tub, and several full-size trees with their root balls floating down the Kern River in Kernville.

""The river is now surrounding some RVs and mobile homes. It's really unbelievable,"" said Danny Housh, who has been working in Kernville for 17 years and said he's never seen anything like this before.

To the north, as Friday's heavy rains pummeled Santa Cruz County, about 700 residents in Soquel got trapped after a pipe failure collapsed the only road linking the community to the rest of the region, said Steve Wiesner, the county's assistant public works director.

""We are now an island,"" resident Molly Watson told CNN.

Another hard hit area was Tulare County, where video from Springville showed devastating damage after Friday's severe flooding.

""It's quite heartbreaking,"" Hatti Shepard told CNN. ""Many hard-working people displaced with losses of home and possessions.""

The recent atmospheric rivers are the latest to inundate the state after a barrage of similar storms in December and January also resulted in deadly flooding and widespread damage.

Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow bands of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose.

This new wave of storms is bearing down on areas already buried by heavy snowfall from the past two weeks. Melting snowpack will also play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days, forecasters say.

Despite uncertainty on the timing of this system, forecasters know it'll bring yet another round of heavy precipitation, as well as heavy snowfall for the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada.

The National Weather Service's prediction center issued a Level 3 out of 4 risk for excessive rain across northern California on Monday and across portions of the central California coast and Sierra Nevada on Tuesday.

The rain is expected to start intensifying late Monday and the heavy rainfall, combined with the snowmelt, is forecast to fuel more flooding from Tuesday into Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.

The National Weather Service warned of ""considerable flooding impacts"" below 5000-foot elevations across large portions of central California into Tuesday.

""In addition, heavy rain and snowmelt may lead to renewed (more widespread) flooding from Monday to Tuesday, particularly in low elevations and shallow and warming snowpack areas,"" the National Weather Service said.

Creeks and streams, already overflowing, are expected to continue to be vulnerable to flooding from additional rain and snowmelt.

In Southern California, peak rain rates of up to an inch per hour are expected over the mountains and foothills.

The weather service office in Los Angeles said residents could expect shallow mud and debris flows in recent burn areas, downed trees and powerlines and travel delays due to flooded road and mudslides.

By Aya Elamroussi, CNN

Forceful flooding that washed away roads and sent residents across parts of northern and central California fleeing their homes is expected to continue Saturday and through the weekend as more rain arrives.

But Saturday is not projected to bring the torrential walls of rain that battered communities Friday, which saw bridges collapse, roads split open and caused thousands of power outages.

At least two people have died as a result of the storms, officials said.

""Overall the environmental ingredients aren't as impressive as the recent strong atmospheric river event, but nonetheless a prolonged period of light to occasionally moderate rainfall is expected across parts of central to northern California"" on Saturday, the Weather Prediction Center said.

The impacts from this week's storms have been compounded after severe rainfall was dumped over the same areas buried by heavy snowfalls the past two weeks. Melting snowpack will play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days, forecasters have said.

About 15 million people were under flood watches -- stretching from as far north as Redding southward to San Bernardino in California, and included parts of northwest Nevada. Flood warnings were still in effect across portions of northern and central California through early Saturday.

A slight risk of excessive rainfall, a level 2 out of 4, has also been issued across portions of the northern California coast as well as down the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected Saturday.

Evacuations orders were expanded in Tulare County to include the community of Teviston as well as parts of Cutler and Exeter because river flow had increased, according to the county sheriff's office Friday night. Officials urged residents to stay clear of waterways and avoid all unnecessary travel.

""Due to the amount of added water to Lake Success from the rain and runoff, the water levels are predicted to reach the spillway,"" the sheriff's office said.

Friday's heavy rains pummeled Santa Cruz County, where about 700 residents in Soquel became trapped after a pipe failure led to severe flooding and the collapse of the one road linking the community to the rest of the region, according to Steve Wiesner, the county's assistant public works director. Residents will remain isolated until a new crossing can be created, which could take days, Wiesner said.

""This is the one road that leads into town,"" resident Molly Watson told CNN. ""We are now an island.""

A photo Watson shared with CNN captures a chaotic scene where a large piece of road is washed out by flood waters while cracked pavement appears to sink into the rushing water. Emergency crews stand on one side of road -- on the other, residents look on.

""I've lived here my whole life, and I've never seen the creek go actually through the road,"" Soquel resident Nick Maleta told CNN affiliate KGO, and likened the powerful heavy rainfall to a tornado.

""All night long, you could hear, the water is so saturated right and the cottonwoods especially are so weak, you could just hear them tumbling all night long,"" Maleta said.

Soquel is one of the hardest-hit areas in Santa Cruz County, soaking more than 6.5 inches of rain in certain areas while widespread rainfall was about 2 inches, according to a report from the National Weather Service office in San Francisco.

As of Saturday morning, more than 41,000 homes and businesses across the state were without power, with about 30,000 of those outages in coastal Monterey County, according to tracking site PowerOutage.us.

The flooding has forced local emergency crews to rescue more than 90 people in Monterey County, Sheriff Tina Nieto said in a news briefing Saturday afternoon.

Workers attempted to prevent the levee catastrophe Friday night, but they were ""overwhelmed by the flows coming down that watershed,"" said Lew Bauman, interim manager of the county's Water Resources Agency.

In the meantime, officials said people need to obey evacuation orders.

""It will take some time, particularly with repeated rain events, for the area to dry,"" said Bauman.

Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County board of supervisors, tweeted Saturday that the ""worst case scenario"" had arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and a levee breaching around midnight local time.

At 9 a.m. Saturday, the breach was 100 feet wide, officials said.

Sheriff's deputies were going door-to-door to get remaining residents in affected neighborhoods to leave before water inundated their homes, said county Office of Emergency Services Manager Gerry Malais.

""National Guard high-water rescue vehicles that were requested by the County of Monterey and swift-water rescue team members are also on the scene,"" the county said earlier Saturday.

To alleviate yet another natural disaster gripping California, President Joe Biden approved a state of emergency declaration requested by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The move frees funds for the millions of residents who have been hit with severe weather since the beginning of the year.

Meanwhile, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo issued a state of emergency for Churchill, Douglas and Lyon counties in the northern section of the state due to flooding associated with the same storm.

""Severe weather has brought heavy rainfall, flooding, and infrastructure damage to northern Nevada. As severe weather conditions continue, further flooding and infrastructure damage are anticipated throughout the region,"" the governor's office said in a statement.

Parts of California saw more than a foot of rain

An atmospheric river -- which consists of long, narrow bands of moisture in the atmosphere that carry warm air and water vapor from the tropics -- brought colossal amounts of rain in places that could not bear taking any more.

Anderson Peak in Monterey County was drenched with 13.63 inches of rain, according to the NWS' San Francisco office. Elsewhere in the county, isolated rainfalls in Hearst Castle were 11.61 inches and 8.36 inches.

Double-digit inches of rain were also seen in San Mateo County's Pacifica, where 13.41 inches of rainfall were reported. Several areas in Santa Cruz County saw more than 5 inches of rain while 6.56 inches of isolated rainfall were recorded in Sonoma County.

In Tulare County, the sheriff's office received reports of widespread flooding, collapsed bridges, downed trees and separated roads.

The intense rain came as 34 of California's 58 counties have been under a state of emergency issued by the governor's office due to previous storms and this week's severe weather threat.

Officials release water from major dam

To manage the heavy amounts of rainfall, California water officials have begun releasing water from the main spillway at the Oroville Dam for the first time in four years, according to a news release from the California Department of Water Resources.

The spillway of Oroville Dam, the nation's tallest dam at 770 feet in the Feather River, opened Friday at noon and are expected to remain through the weekend.

""In anticipation of increased runoff inflows into the reservoir, DWR has begun increasing water releases to the Feather River through the Hyatt Powerplant and from the main spillway. These releases provide flood control protection for downstream communities,"" the department said, adding that the tactic is coordinated closely with the US Army Corps of Engineers and other water operators.

In 2017, the dam was closed for two years after powerful storms caused Lake Oroville's water level to rise and overflow the dam. It reopened in 2019 after crews reconstructed its full functionality.

To alleviate yet another natural disaster gripping California, President Joe Biden approved a state of emergency declaration requested by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The move frees funds for the millions of residents who have been hit with severe weather since the beginning of the year.

Meanwhile, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo issued a state of emergency for Churchill, Douglas and Lyon counties in the northern section of the state due to flooding associated with the same storm.

""Severe weather has brought heavy rainfall, flooding, and infrastructure damage to northern Nevada. As severe weather conditions continue, further flooding and infrastructure damage are anticipated throughout the region,"" the governor's office said in a statement.

Parts of California saw more than a foot of rain

An atmospheric river -- which consists of long, narrow bands of moisture in the atmosphere that carry warm air and water vapor from the tropics -- brought colossal amounts of rain in places that could not bear taking any more.

Anderson Peak in Monterey County was drenched with 13.63 inches of rain, according to the NWS' San Francisco office. Elsewhere in the county, isolated rainfalls in Hearst Castle were 11.61 inches and 8.36 inches.

Double-digit inches of rain were also seen in San Mateo County's Pacifica, where 13.41 inches of rainfall were reported. Several areas in Santa Cruz County saw more than 5 inches of rain while 6.56 inches of isolated rainfall were recorded in Sonoma County.

In Tulare County, the sheriff's office received reports of widespread flooding, collapsed bridges, downed trees and separated roads.

The intense rain came as 34 of California's 58 counties have been under a state of emergency issued by the governor's office due to previous storms and this week's severe weather threat.

Officials release water from major dam

To manage the heavy amounts of rainfall, California water officials have begun releasing water from the main spillway at the Oroville Dam for the first time in four years, according to a news release from the California Department of Water Resources.

The spillway of Oroville Dam, the nation's tallest dam at 770 feet in the Feather River, opened Friday at noon and are expected to remain through the weekend.

""In anticipation of increased runoff inflows into the reservoir, DWR has begun increasing water releases to the Feather River through the Hyatt Powerplant and from the main spillway. These releases provide flood control protection for downstream communities,"" the department said, adding that the tactic is coordinated closely with the US Army Corps of Engineers and other water operators.

In 2017, the dam was closed for two years after powerful storms caused Lake Oroville's water level to rise and overflow the dam. It reopened in 2019 after crews reconstructed its full functionality.

The National Weather Service said the next torrent could exacerbate the severe flooding that overwhelmed the area in recent days, causing a levee failure that prompted widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's Central Coast.

The next system is not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters cautioned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur in lower elevations from additional rain and snowmelt that could swell creeks and streams.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts even today,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

The rain and snow is expected to extend from Central California to Oregon, as well as northern Nevada.

Of particular concern are the expected strong winds. The weather service is predicting wind gusts of up to 50 mph in some places -- which could potentially snap tree branches and damage power lines.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the past two days, more than 20 inches of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and the new system is expected to pack even more. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average -- the highest amount of snowfall in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, according to weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuation orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Hispanic farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli said on Sunday. He said the county is staging high-water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding as the new storm rolls in.

The flooding has impacted drinking water facilities in Pajaro. Officials said residents should not drink tap water for cooking or drinking until further notice.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damage was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, moving to expedite more federal assistance. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

More than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders March 11 after storms ripped across Central Coast's Monterey County, according to The Associated Press (AP). Though police officials went door-to-door, urging citizens to leave March 10, some stayed behind only to be rescued the following day when the floodwaters breached a 100-foot wide levee of the Pajaro River. (RELATED: 38 Million Americans Facing 'Extreme' Risk Of Flash Flooding In California)

Officials had reportedly been working overnight to strengthen the levee when it was breached just after midnight on Saturday morning, forcing more than 1,700 residents of Pajaro out of their homes. Though crew have been working to repair the damage, Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors stated the repairs in and around the flooded community will take months.

""We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,""Alejo wrote on Twitter.

""I thank all our 1st responders & county staff for helping our residents evacuate in an orderly fashion & helping residents relocate to our shelters..."" Alejo added in another tweet.

By Aya Elamroussi, CNN

Forceful flooding that washed away roads and sent residents across parts of northern and central California fleeing their homes is expected to continue Saturday and through the weekend as more rain arrives.

But Saturday is not projected to bring the torrential walls of rain that battered communities Friday, which saw bridges collapse, roads split open and caused thousands of power outages.

At least two people have died as a result of the storms, officials said.

""Overall the environmental ingredients aren't as impressive as the recent strong atmospheric river event, but nonetheless a prolonged period of light to occasionally moderate rainfall is expected across parts of central to northern California"" on Saturday, the Weather Prediction Center said.

The impacts from this week's storms have been compounded after severe rainfall was dumped over the same areas buried by heavy snowfalls the past two weeks. Melting snowpack will play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days, forecasters have said.

About 15 million people were under flood watches -- stretching from as far north as Redding southward to San Bernardino in California, and included parts of northwest Nevada. Flood warnings were still in effect across portions of northern and central California through early Saturday.

A slight risk of excessive rainfall, a level 2 out of 4, has also been issued across portions of the northern California coast as well as down the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected Saturday.

Evacuations orders were expanded in Tulare County to include the community of Teviston as well as parts of Cutler and Exeter because river flow had increased, according to the county sheriff's office Friday night. Officials urged residents to stay clear of waterways and avoid all unnecessary travel.

""Due to the amount of added water to Lake Success from the rain and runoff, the water levels are predicted to reach the spillway,"" the sheriff's office said.

Friday's heavy rains pummeled Santa Cruz County, where about 700 residents in Soquel became trapped after a pipe failure led to severe flooding and the collapse of the one road linking the community to the rest of the region, according to Steve Wiesner, the county's assistant public works director. Residents will remain isolated until a new crossing can be created, which could take days, Wiesner said.

""This is the one road that leads into town,"" resident Molly Watson told CNN. ""We are now an island.""

A photo Watson shared with CNN captures a chaotic scene where a large piece of road is washed out by flood waters while cracked pavement appears to sink into the rushing water. Emergency crews stand on one side of road -- on the other, residents look on.

""I've lived here my whole life, and I've never seen the creek go actually through the road,"" Soquel resident Nick Maleta told CNN affiliate KGO, and likened the powerful heavy rainfall to a tornado.

""All night long, you could hear, the water is so saturated right and the cottonwoods especially are so weak, you could just hear them tumbling all night long,"" Maleta said.

Soquel is one of the hardest-hit areas in Santa Cruz County, soaking more than 6.5 inches of rain in certain areas while widespread rainfall was about 2 inches, according to a report from the National Weather Service office in San Francisco.

As of Saturday morning, more than 41,000 homes and businesses across the state were without power, with about 30,000 of those outages in coastal Monterey County, according to tracking site PowerOutage.us.

The flooding has forced local emergency crews to rescue more than 90 people in Monterey County, Sheriff Tina Nieto said in a news briefing Saturday afternoon.

Workers attempted to prevent the levee catastrophe Friday night, but they were ""overwhelmed by the flows coming down that watershed,"" said Lew Bauman, interim manager of the county's Water Resources Agency.

In the meantime, officials said people need to obey evacuation orders.

""It will take some time, particularly with repeated rain events, for the area to dry,"" said Bauman.

Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County board of supervisors, tweeted Saturday that the ""worst case scenario"" had arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and a levee breaching around midnight local time.

At 9 a.m. Saturday, the breach was 100 feet wide, officials said.

Sheriff's deputies were going door-to-door to get remaining residents in affected neighborhoods to leave before water inundated their homes, said county Office of Emergency Services Manager Gerry Malais.

""National Guard high-water rescue vehicles that were requested by the County of Monterey and swift-water rescue team members are also on the scene,"" the county said earlier Saturday.

To alleviate yet another natural disaster gripping California, President Joe Biden approved a state of emergency declaration requested by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The move frees funds for the millions of residents who have been hit with severe weather since the beginning of the year.

Meanwhile, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo issued a state of emergency for Churchill, Douglas and Lyon counties in the northern section of the state due to flooding associated with the same storm.

""Severe weather has brought heavy rainfall, flooding, and infrastructure damage to northern Nevada. As severe weather conditions continue, further flooding and infrastructure damage are anticipated throughout the region,"" the governor's office said in a statement.

Parts of California saw more than a foot of rain

An atmospheric river -- which consists of long, narrow bands of moisture in the atmosphere that carry warm air and water vapor from the tropics -- brought colossal amounts of rain in places that could not bear taking any more.

Anderson Peak in Monterey County was drenched with 13.63 inches of rain, according to the NWS' San Francisco office. Elsewhere in the county, isolated rainfalls in Hearst Castle were 11.61 inches and 8.36 inches.

Double-digit inches of rain were also seen in San Mateo County's Pacifica, where 13.41 inches of rainfall were reported. Several areas in Santa Cruz County saw more than 5 inches of rain while 6.56 inches of isolated rainfall were recorded in Sonoma County.

In Tulare County, the sheriff's office received reports of widespread flooding, collapsed bridges, downed trees and separated roads.

The intense rain came as 34 of California's 58 counties have been under a state of emergency issued by the governor's office due to previous storms and this week's severe weather threat.

Officials release water from major dam

To manage the heavy amounts of rainfall, California water officials have begun releasing water from the main spillway at the Oroville Dam for the first time in four years, according to a news release from the California Department of Water Resources.

The spillway of Oroville Dam, the nation's tallest dam at 770 feet in the Feather River, opened Friday at noon and are expected to remain through the weekend.

""In anticipation of increased runoff inflows into the reservoir, DWR has begun increasing water releases to the Feather River through the Hyatt Powerplant and from the main spillway. These releases provide flood control protection for downstream communities,"" the department said, adding that the tactic is coordinated closely with the US Army Corps of Engineers and other water operators.

In 2017, the dam was closed for two years after powerful storms caused Lake Oroville's water level to rise and overflow the dam. It reopened in 2019 after crews reconstructed its full functionality.

Forecasters were predicting the Cat 2 or Cat 3 atmospheric river will pummel the region beginning late Monday night. A low pressure system spinning northeast of the Bay Area will intensify the storm's rain and winds.

Flooded roadways, landslides, falling trees and power outages were expected across the waterlogged region.

""This is shaping up to be a significant system with the potential for wide-reaching and long-lasting impacts,"" the National Weather Service said.

A flood watch for the entire Bay Area was in place until Wednesday with a high wind warning kicking in on Monday night ""given increasing confidence in the expectation for strong to damaging wind gusts.""

Flooding was also expected to continue along the Salinas and Pajaro rivers as the brunt of the storm roars into the Monterey Peninsula.

""Latest guidance indicates the bulk of the atmospheric will once again come onshore to our south with stronger forecast into Central California,"" the weather service said. ""Saturated soils coupled with elevated river and stream levels suggest that water related impacts are a sure bet.""

That's not the news the residents of the flooded farm community of Pajaro needed to hear. A levee breach has sent thigh high water rushing through the community.

While more than 2,000 residents have been evacuated, Maria Garcia and her family are among those who have chosen to stay.

""We stay here because it'll cost a lot more if we leave,"" Maria told KPIX.

Her parents are farmworkers. Recent storms flooded the strawberry fields where they work. Maria interpreted for her father Jesus Garcia.

""They're trying not to waste that much money, because they haven't been to work for two months, so there's not a lot of money and the fact that this closed down, and we can't go over there, so we can't really get food either, so we have to keep a budget,"" Maria explained of the closed bridge.

Santa Cruz County supervisor Felipe Hernandez said on Sunday, the shelter at the fairgrounds was completely full.

""It's heartbreaking, for me I'm thinking about recovery after this disaster how we can get back on our feet, how we get our economy back, our local economy is all agriculture here,"" said Hernandez.

He said Pajaro, which last flooded in 1995, needs helps from the state and federal government.

He advises residents choosing to stay behind under the mandatory evacuation order to think again.

""I think everywhere that we have an evacuation order they're under three feet of water right now. And the National Guard is in there, so it's not a matter of they can stay there, it's dangerous for them to stay there,"" he said.

Monterey County sent out an unsafe water alert Sunday night.

""We got water before, like a lot of water just in case, we have a water bottle to wash our hands with,"" said Jonathan Alcantar, who is staying behind with his father.

But the new round of rain has Alcantar's family reconsidering their choice.

""He feels like we're probably going to have to leave this time,"" Jonathan said of his father. They are sticking it out for now.

""And the bathroom situation... we have two days since we haven't taken a shower... we have clothes haven't cleaned, and the food problem, and the animal problem,"" added Maria.

Maria found a cat that was left behind by another family and is taking care of it temporarily.

Her dad said he feel stuck - literally and figuratively.

""He feels affected because he can't protect his family and serve them as a father should and he can't really leave having to not come back here,"" added Maria.",[],"[{'uri':

The flooding comes after an atmospheric river dumped rain over Northern and Central California on Thursday and Friday; a similar storm is expected to hit the area Monday night and Tuesday.

Flood stage on the Salinas River is 23 feet; this is the point at which it rises above its banks and inundates nearby areas with water. At 2 a.m. Monday, the river rose to 26 feet, and was forecast to hit 27.5 feet before declining, according to the California Nevada River Forecast Center.

The river is expected to remain above flood stage through the work week as the second storm is forecast to bring yet more rain to an area where soils are waterlogged from an unusually wet winter. If the river were to rise above 28 feet, it would significantly impact travel in the region. KSBW reported that in the ""worst-case scenario,"" the Monterey Peninsula becomes an inaccessible island, with flooding waters shutting down both highways 1 and 68.

The flooding on the Salinas River comes after a levee broke on the Pajaro River late Saturday night, flooding residences and roadways in the small community of Pajaro near Santa Cruz.","[{'uri': 'amy_graff@sfgate.com', 'name': 'Amy Graff', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_California', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Central California'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_river', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Atmospheric river'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss_Landing,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Moss Landing, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Moss Landing, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolon,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Jolon, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Jolon, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinas_River_(California)', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Salinas River (California)'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nevada'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Nevada'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSBW', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'KSBW'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Peninsula', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey Peninsula'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Soil'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Santa Cruz, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Santa Cruz, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}]",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/31/71/06/23564687/5/rawImage.jpg,eng-8468865,-0.1372549019607843,416420400,1,sfgate.com,news,San Francisco Gate,"Flood Central California Atmospheric river Moss Landing, California Jolon, California Salinas River (California) Nevada California KSBW Monterey Peninsula Pajaro River Levee Soil Santa Cruz, California",United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,20,16,2023-03-13

More than 8,500 people were evacuated.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from a new atmospheric river that was expected to arrive Monday night in northern and central parts of the state and move south over several days.

The massive plume of Pacific Ocean moisture stretched all the way to near Hawaii.

""Avoid unnecessary travel and complete all preparations as soon as possible,"" the San Francisco Bay Area weather office said.

California has already been battered by 10 atmospheric rivers this winter, most recently by a system that hit last week, as well as storms fueled by arctic air that reached blizzard status.

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

The incoming atmospheric river won't be as warm as the previous one because it has incorporated cold air on the back end, Swain said.

Even though it won't be an extreme atmospheric river, its rain will fall on soils that are supersaturated, he said.

(AP) -- A levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast doubled in size Monday, complicating repair efforts and spilling floodwaters into farmland and agricultural communities -- even as yet another atmospheric river took aim at the swamped state.

(AP) -- A levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast doubled in size Monday, complicating repair efforts and spilling floodwaters into farmland and agricultural communities -- even as yet another atmospheric river took aim at the swamped state.

The Pajaro River's levee rupture has grown to 300 feet (90 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were evacuated.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from a new atmospheric river that was expected to arrive Monday night in northern and central parts of the state and move south over several days.

The massive plume of Pacific Ocean moisture stretched all the way to near Hawaii.

""Avoid unnecessary travel and complete all preparations as soon as possible,"" the San Francisco Bay Area weather office said.

California has already been battered by 10 atmospheric rivers this winter, most recently by a system that hit last week, as well as storms fueled by arctic air that reached blizzard status.

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

The incoming atmospheric river won't be as warm as the previous one because it has incorporated cold air on the back end, Swain said.

Even though it won't be an extreme atmospheric river, its rain will fall on soils that are supersaturated, he said.

""This is why I'm more concerned about this one than the previous one,"" he said.

The system is the latest in the series of intense storms that have battered California in recent weeks. Over the weekend, it exacerbated already severe flooding in parts of the state, including prompting a levee failure and widespread evacuations Saturday in farming communities near the state's central coast.

The rain is expected to start in the mountains around the Coachella Valley during the day Tuesday, with the valley starting to see rain that night.

""It looks like the heaviest and most widespread activity is going to occur Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, before tapering off Wednesday afternoon,"" National Weather Service Meteorologist Elizabeth Adams said.

As is often the case with storms in the valley, the heaviest precipitation is expected to be in northern and western parts of the valley. The Palm Springs area is expected to see about a quarter of an inch of rain, while Indio will see less than a tenth of an inch.

The Riverside County mountains, meanwhile, are expected to see 1 to 3 inches of rain, with rain heaviest in northern areas. Mountain areas above 9,000 feet could see a little snow Wednesday morning as the storm taper off, but only trace amounts of snow accumulation are expected.

The storm will always bring winds to the valley starting Wednesday, with maximum gusts of 30 to 40 mph expected in the valley and 40 to 60 mph in the mountains and even 70 mph on the highest peaks.

Temperatures are expected remain high Tuesday with highs in the mid 70s to 80s across the valley and 40s and 50s in the mountains. Highs in the valley will drop into the low 70s Wednesday.

While the atmospheric river was expected to lessen in strength as it moved south, the northern parts of the state were already preparing for another storm that was moving in Monday.

That storm was not expected to bring as much rain, but forecasters warned that ""considerable flooding"" could occur at lower elevations from additional rain and creeks and streams swollen with snowmelt.

""Definitely prepare for some more flooding impacts. The ground is very saturated. We're already seeing some impacts from some light amounts,"" National Weather Service forecaster Eleanor Dhuyvetter said.

A tornado briefly touched down in Tuolumne County during severe thunderstorms Saturday that also dumped an inch of hail, the weather service office in Sacramento said.

Monday's incoming rain and snow is expected to extend from central California to Oregon and northern Nevada. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected in some places and could damage power lines and snap tree branches.

But the new storm is moving fast, meaning it won't have time to dump as much rain.

Over the weekend, more than 20 inches of snow fell at a measuring station in the Sierra Nevada, and more is expected. The snowpack is now nearly twice the average, and the highest in about four decades, according to UC Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab.

The snowpack stores much-needed water for a state seeking to emerge from a three-year drought.

As much as a foot of rain fell in the Big Sur area of the state over a two-day period, weather data.

Authorities suggest that residents have a plan in case further evacuations orders are issued.

Across Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were evacuated Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents -- many of them Latino farmworkers -- from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.

""We are still in disaster response mode,"" said Monterey County spokesman Nicholas Pasculli on Sunday. He said the county is staging high water rescue teams around the county and opening more shelters in anticipation of more flooding.

Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is closed at several points along Big Sur as well as near Pajaro due to flooding.

The atmospheric river, known as a ""Pineapple Express"" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack in California's mountains.

Because of the massive flooding over the early weekend, more than 50 people had to be rescued by first responders and the California National Guard. One video showed a Guard member helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.

The extent of property damages was still uncertain but Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, sought help from the state and federal governments.

""The need will be great! Will take months for our residents to repair homes!"" he wrote in a tweet Saturday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning. President Joe Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge federal support for California's emergency response, the White House said.

Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. By late Sunday morning, about 7,000 were still without electricity.

The governor's office said it was continuing to monitor the situation in Pajaro.

The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Officials had been working to shore up parts of the river's levee system when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.

Built in the late 40s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm was undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

This week's storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen drought conditions. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_Valley', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coachella Valley'}}, {'uri':

WATSONVILLE, Calif. >> A levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast has quadrupled in size, complicating repair efforts today and spilling floodwaters into farmland and agricultural communities -- even as yet another atmospheric river took aim at the swamped state.

The Pajaro River's levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and around 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades with several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in 2025.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles south of San Francisco.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from a new atmospheric river that was expected to arrive tonight in northern and central parts of the state and move south over several days.

The massive plume of Pacific Ocean moisture stretched all the way to near Hawaii.

""Avoid unnecessary travel and complete all preparations as soon as possible,"" the San Francisco Bay Area weather office said.

California has already been battered by 10 atmospheric rivers this winter, most recently by a system that hit last week, as well as storms fueled by arctic air that reached blizzard status.

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed today that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

The incoming atmospheric river won't be as warm as the previous one because it has incorporated cold air on the back end, Swain said.

Even though it won't be an extreme atmospheric river, its rain will fall on soils that are supersaturated, he said.

""This is why I'm more concerned about this one than the previous one,"" he said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and around 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from a new atmospheric river expected to arrive Monday night in northern and central parts of the state and move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Water from the upcoming storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri':

Truck drivers made 120-mile round trips to quarries in Cupertino and Greenfield that normally shut down at 3:30 p.m. but promised to stay open into the night.

""My dispatcher told me, 'You better pack a lunch,'"" said Todd Mosley, waiting for his turn to empty his truck and help plug another section of what the day before was a 360-foot wide breach.

By midday Monday, boulders had filled in about 100 feet. The rest was an open spigot of muddy water, still flowing freely into the streets of the nearby Pajaro. It was too late to save the town from rising waters that have plagued it before. The quest now is to keep the river from doing even more damage.

""We are working 24/7 until this problem is resolved,"" said Shaunna Murray, a senior water resources engineer at the Monterey County Water Resources Agency.

John Foxworthy, a dam safety engineer with the agency, was on the levee when it burst late Friday night, and was back Monday. He knows what is at stake. But the worst has already happened - more than a thousand residents in this farmworker town were forced to flee their homes in the middle of the night Saturday when the water rushed in.

""We're doing all we can to get those people back in their homes,"" said Foxworthy as he trudged across the levee and watched the boulders pile up, inching closer to connect with the opposite side.

Holding back a river is never easy.

In the midst of berry fields in the fertile Pajaro Valley, the earthen levee and the dirt road leading to it are soft and narrow. So the Super-10 dump trucks that can carry up to 16 tons of rock and the End Dumps that can hold up to 19 tons dropped their cargo at a staging area next to an old barn. A smaller truck that could cut through the mud loaded up and rumbled past the yellow farmhouse and the apple orchard and headed to the gaping hole.

""It's a very hard site to access -- and try to stabilize the breach,"" Murray said. ""We hope we have this whole thing buttoned up, but it's really hard -- there's a whole lot of moving pieces.""

A contingency plan was already in place in case they couldn't beat Tuesday's oncoming storm. Helicopters working for the state Department of Water Resources were preparing to dump more rock from the sky.

The Pajaro River, which forms the border of Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, has flooded at least six times in the last 70 years -- in December 1955, April 1958, February 1986, March 1995, January 1998 and February 1998.

In an error that has haunted the region for 75 years, the engineers who first designed the levee system lacked enough historic stream data and miscalculated the amount of water that could flow from Santa Clara and San Benito counties during big storms. They built the levees too small. They thought they were protecting against a 50-year flood. Instead, later studies found they were only offering about 15-year flood protection.

After decades of political wrangling, the state recently set aside $400 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to overhaul the 12-mile levee system. Construction on the project was expected to begin in 2025. But the rescue came too late.

""I remember saying 'I hope to God it doesn't rain before this gets done,"" said State Sen. John Laird, D-Santa Cruz. ""We didn't make it. We have worked so hard to try to prevent this day. It's so disheartening.""

The flood fighters trying to prevent the breach Friday night felt the same way.

As rain poured down before midnight, crews scrambled from one ""boil fight"" to the next, Foxworthy said. The levee was springing leaks - boiling up through the mud - and crews built rings of sandbags around them. Sediment-laden water also poured through rodent holes. Plugging them up directly would only cause more back-up pressure.

Then, at about 11:40 p.m., a sinkhole started to form.

""The water was moving fast enough to where it was just milk chocolatey and moving the dirt from within the side of the levee,"" Foxworthy said, ""and that created a sinkhole that everyone was working around.""

But as the sinkhole widened, officials deemed it too dangerous to continue working, Foxworthy said. The levee could break and the crews could be stranded or swept into the river. The decision to abandon the levee, he said, wasn't an easy one.

""I live here,"" he said. ""It's not easy knowing all the people that would be affected.""

Within 20 minutes, he said, after they had counted every crew member as safe, he heard the sounds of the breach. The temporary ""muscle wall"" - linked plastic, water-filled containers atop a low portion of the levee that had saved Pajaro during January rains - buckled.

""The flood wall cracked and separated,"" he said. ""You can hear the joints in the plastic give way and then you can hear the rush of the water.""

Four miles downstream, some 800 homes flooded in the early morning hours. Dozens of people were rescued in boats and high-water trucks. Many slept in their cars that night. But no one was killed.

A bit of good news came Monday afternoon. A second breach opened up near the mouth of the river, about nine miles from the first breach and close to the ocean. It had the effect of lowering water levels upriver where the crews were working.

""We are starting to see the water starting to recede,"" Murray said Monday afternoon.

And on the edge of the apple orchard where storm clouds gathered and crews continued to dump boulders into the river, Foxworthy was hopeful.

""We're just doing the best that we can,"" he said, ""and we're trying to get to the other side before the next storm.""","[{'uri': 'john_woolfolk@eastbaytimes.com', 'name': 'John Woolfolk', 'type':

(AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

The break caused widespread flooding in the Pajaro community nearby.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast before yet another atmospheric river arrives Monday night, further walloping the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and around 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from a new atmospheric river expected to arrive Monday night in northern and central parts of the state and move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Water from the upcoming storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

California will be hit with a second atmospheric river this week as it braces for excessive rainfall and possibly flash floods through Wednesday morning.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

More than 30 million people across the state were under flood alerts as the West's 11th atmospheric river of the season pushed into northern California and aimed towards central and southern California Tuesday, battering ground already saturated with water from the last round of rain and swollen rivers that have overflowed their banks.

The storm comes on the heels of another deadly atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose. This round can bring up to 8 inches of rain in some areas, with rainfall coming down as fast as 1 inch per hour.

There are scattered evacuation alerts across multiple counties, including in Monterey County where residents along the Salinas River were ordered to flee. Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties both issued evacuation warnings Monday night ahead of the atmospheric river's arrival in the south, with Santa Barbara officials saying the warnings will become orders in the morning.

""The forthcoming rainstorms cause concerns of localized flooding impacts to already damaged infrastructure and increased potential for debris flows and mudslides,"" the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management said in an email to CNN.

Already, over 600 Californians have taken refuge in 32 shelters across 13 counties and California National Guard troops are out helping with swift water rescues from deluged streets. Numerous roads statewide are closed and a river levee has been breached.

""We weren't expecting it to be as bad as we're seeing it,"" Monterey Mayor Tyller Williamson told CNN Monday.

Forty of the state's 58 counties are now under a state of emergency declaration ordered by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and crews positioned across the state are bracing for more overflowing rivers, floods, mudslides and impassable roads.

Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse says the storm is now predicted to be much more significant than originally thought.

""We will wait to see how the intensity plays out before authorizing any evacuations,"" Rowse said in an email. ""We feel prepared, but will maintain a high level of vigilance.""

The ""high-impact"" atmospheric river was expected to hit southern California Tuesday afternoon before beginning to taper off during Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service, which warns another round of major and life-threatening flooding is likely along much of the California coast, central Valley and Sierra foothills.

Meanwhile, as California is hammered with rain, another major winter storm is walloping the Northeast, where widespread heavy snowfall is likely from the northeast Pennsylvania and far northwest New Jersey area, through much of New York state and New England.

Swollen rivers are a concern as one levee breach widens

As intense rain wallops California, the National Weather Service warns that creeks and streams may rise out of their banks and fuel extensive street flooding.

""Lingering impacts from last week's flooding is likely to get worse with this second storm,"" the Weather Service said in a forecast message.

Parts of Monterey County -- including Salinas -- could get cut off by flooding on the Salinas River, officials said. Those at risk ""can and should seek shelter"" with family or friends or at one of the county's evacuation shelters, county officials said.

The Salinas River ""is looking at breaching one of the major highways that folks use to get to the peninsula and so we're just concerned in regards to the highway 68,"" Williamson said.

The storm also placed greater urgency on repairing a levee in Monterey County that was breached around midnight Friday by the swollen Pajaro River, forcing thousands to evacuate as water rushed into and flooded the nearby Pajaro community.

""It was 120 feet when the levee initially broke, and now it's expanded to 300 feet,"" Williamson said of the breach, calling it ""a significant issue.""

Crews are racing to shore up the breach with a temporary rock and sand wall to slow the flow of water into Pajaro. ""A permanent fix will be undertaken once this crisis has passed,"" Monterey County officials said.

""The situation is dynamic and evolving,"" said Flood Division Manager Jeremy Arrich, as construction crews work to stabilize the levee and engineers focus on short and long term fixes. The flood division is proactively reaching out to other levee managers throughout the region to ensure safety and stability in preparation for the incoming rain.

The recent atmospheric rivers are just the latest to inundate California after an onslaught of similar storms in December and January also resulted in deadly flooding -- and it isn't stopping here.

After this latest atmospheric river sweeps through California by Wednesday, the state will only get a few days of relief from heavy precipitation before another atmospheric river arrives next week, according to the National Weather Service.

Snowmelt may worsen flooding

With this new wave of storms pummeling areas already buried by heavy snowfall from the past two weeks, forecasters have warned that the melting snowpack will play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days.

Snow melt at elevations below 5,000 feet could particularly worsen the flooding in the Sierra, where accumulations of 3 to 5 feet are likely above 7,500 feet, the National Weather Service said.

""Heavy rain absorbed into the particularly deep snowpack in the Sierra Nevada along with heavy snow, measuring in feet above the 7500 feet, will further compound ongoing snow load impacts and issues,"" the National Weather Service said.

That doesn't necessarily mean the rain will fully melt the snow pack away.

During the last storm, the deep snow pack mostly absorbed more water than it melted, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said.

""There is more snow water in the southern and possibly central Sierra than there has ever been at this time of year and possibly at any point during the year especially in the southern Sierra. So there is a whole hell of a lot of water up there right now stored in the snowpack,"" Swain said.

More than 30 million people across the state were under flood alerts as the West's 11th atmospheric river of the season pushed into northern California and aimed towards central and southern California Tuesday, battering ground already saturated with water from the last round of rain and swollen rivers that have overflowed their banks.

The storm comes on the heels of another deadly atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose. This round can bring up to 8 inches of rain in some areas, with rainfall coming down as fast as 1 inch per hour.

There are scattered evacuation alerts across multiple counties, including in Monterey County where residents along the Salinas River were ordered to flee. Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties both issued evacuation warnings Monday night ahead of the atmospheric river's arrival in the south, with Santa Barbara officials saying the warnings will become orders in the morning.

""The forthcoming rainstorms cause concerns of localized flooding impacts to already damaged infrastructure and increased potential for debris flows and mudslides,"" the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management said in an email to CNN.

Already, over 600 Californians have taken refuge in 32 shelters across 13 counties and California National Guard troops are out helping with swift water rescues from deluged streets. Numerous roads statewide are closed and a river levee has been breached.

""We weren't expecting it to be as bad as we're seeing it,"" Monterey Mayor Tyller Williamson told CNN Monday.

Forty of the state's 58 counties are now under a state of emergency declaration ordered by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and crews positioned across the state are bracing for more overflowing rivers, floods, mudslides and impassable roads.

Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse says the storm is now predicted to be much more significant than originally thought.

""We will wait to see how the intensity plays out before authorizing any evacuations,"" Rowse said in an email. ""We feel prepared, but will maintain a high level of vigilance.""

The ""high-impact"" atmospheric river was expected to hit southern California Tuesday afternoon before beginning to taper off during Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service, which warns another round of major and life-threatening flooding is likely along much of the California coast, central Valley and Sierra foothills.

Meanwhile, as California is hammered with rain, another major winter storm is walloping the Northeast, where widespread heavy snowfall is likely from the northeast Pennsylvania and far northwest New Jersey area, through much of New York state and New England.

Swollen rivers are a concern as one levee breach widens

As intense rain wallops California, the National Weather Service warns that creeks and streams may rise out of their banks and fuel extensive street flooding.

""Lingering impacts from last week's flooding is likely to get worse with this second storm,"" the Weather Service said in a forecast message.

Parts of Monterey County -- including Salinas -- could get cut off by flooding on the Salinas River, officials said. Those at risk ""can and should seek shelter"" with family or friends or at one of the county's evacuation shelters, county officials said.

The Salinas River ""is looking at breaching one of the major highways that folks use to get to the peninsula and so we're just concerned in regards to the highway 68,"" Williamson said.

The storm also placed greater urgency on repairing a levee in Monterey County that was breached around midnight Friday by the swollen Pajaro River, forcing thousands to evacuate as water rushed into and flooded the nearby Pajaro community.

""It was 120 feet when the levee initially broke, and now it's expanded to 300 feet,"" Williamson said of the breach, calling it ""a significant issue.""

Crews are racing to shore up the breach with a temporary rock and sand wall to slow the flow of water into Pajaro. ""A permanent fix will be undertaken once this crisis has passed,"" Monterey County officials said.

""The situation is dynamic and evolving,"" said Flood Division Manager Jeremy Arrich, as construction crews work to stabilize the levee and engineers focus on short and long term fixes. The flood division is proactively reaching out to other levee managers throughout the region to ensure safety and stability in preparation for the incoming rain.

The recent atmospheric rivers are just the latest to inundate California after an onslaught of similar storms in December and January also resulted in deadly flooding -- and it isn't stopping here.

After this latest atmospheric river sweeps through California by Wednesday, the state will only get a few days of relief from heavy precipitation before another atmospheric river arrives next week, according to the National Weather Service.

Snowmelt may worsen flooding

With this new wave of storms pummeling areas already buried by heavy snowfall from the past two weeks, forecasters have warned that the melting snowpack will play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days.

Snow melt at elevations below 5,000 feet could particularly worsen the flooding in the Sierra, where accumulations of 3 to 5 feet are likely above 7,500 feet, the National Weather Service said.

""Heavy rain absorbed into the particularly deep snowpack in the Sierra Nevada along with heavy snow, measuring in feet above the 7500 feet, will further compound ongoing snow load impacts and issues,"" the National Weather Service said.

That doesn't necessarily mean the rain will fully melt the snow pack away.

During the last storm, the deep snow pack mostly absorbed more water than it melted, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said.

""There is more snow water in the southern and possibly central Sierra than there has ever been at this time of year and possibly at any point during the year especially in the southern Sierra. So there is a whole hell of a lot of water up there right now stored in the snowpack,"" Swain said.

More than 30 million people across the state were under flood alerts as the West's 11th atmospheric river of the season pushed into northern California and aimed towards central and southern California Tuesday, battering ground already saturated with water from the last round of rain and swollen rivers that have overflowed their banks.

The storm comes on the heels of another deadly atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose. This round can bring up to 8 inches of rain in some areas, with rainfall coming down as fast as 1 inch per hour.

There are scattered evacuation alerts across multiple counties, including in Monterey County where residents along the Salinas River were ordered to flee. Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties both issued evacuation warnings Monday night ahead of the atmospheric river's arrival in the south, with Santa Barbara officials saying the warnings will become orders in the morning.

""The forthcoming rainstorms cause concerns of localized flooding impacts to already damaged infrastructure and increased potential for debris flows and mudslides,"" the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management said in an email to CNN.

Already, over 600 Californians have taken refuge in 32 shelters across 13 counties and California National Guard troops are out helping with swift water rescues from deluged streets. Numerous roads statewide are closed and a river levee has been breached.

""We weren't expecting it to be as bad as we're seeing it,"" Monterey Mayor Tyller Williamson told CNN Monday.

Forty of the state's 58 counties are now under a state of emergency declaration ordered by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and crews positioned across the state are bracing for more overflowing rivers, floods, mudslides and impassable roads.

Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse says the storm is now predicted to be much more significant than originally thought.

""We will wait to see how the intensity plays out before authorizing any evacuations,"" Rowse said in an email. ""We feel prepared, but will maintain a high level of vigilance.""

The ""high-impact"" atmospheric river was expected to hit southern California Tuesday afternoon before beginning to taper off during Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service, which warns another round of major and life-threatening flooding is likely along much of the California coast, central Valley and Sierra foothills.

Meanwhile, as California is hammered with rain, another major winter storm is walloping the Northeast, where widespread heavy snowfall is likely from the northeast Pennsylvania and far northwest New Jersey area, through much of New York state and New England.

Swollen rivers are a concern as one levee breach widens

As intense rain wallops California, the National Weather Service warns that creeks and streams may rise out of their banks and fuel extensive street flooding.

""Lingering impacts from last week's flooding is likely to get worse with this second storm,"" the Weather Service said in a forecast message.

Parts of Monterey County -- including Salinas -- could get cut off by flooding on the Salinas River, officials said. Those at risk ""can and should seek shelter"" with family or friends or at one of the county's evacuation shelters, county officials said.

The Salinas River ""is looking at breaching one of the major highways that folks use to get to the peninsula and so we're just concerned in regards to the highway 68,"" Williamson said.

The storm also placed greater urgency on repairing a levee in Monterey County that was breached around midnight Friday by the swollen Pajaro River, forcing thousands to evacuate as water rushed into and flooded the nearby Pajaro community.

""It was 120 feet when the levee initially broke, and now it's expanded to 300 feet,"" Williamson said of the breach, calling it ""a significant issue.""

Crews are racing to shore up the breach with a temporary rock and sand wall to slow the flow of water into Pajaro. ""A permanent fix will be undertaken once this crisis has passed,"" Monterey County officials said.

""The situation is dynamic and evolving,"" said Flood Division Manager Jeremy Arrich, as construction crews work to stabilize the levee and engineers focus on short and long term fixes. The flood division is proactively reaching out to other levee managers throughout the region to ensure safety and stability in preparation for the incoming rain.

The recent atmospheric rivers are just the latest to inundate California after an onslaught of similar storms in December and January also resulted in deadly flooding -- and it isn't stopping here.

After this latest atmospheric river sweeps through California by Wednesday, the state will only get a few days of relief from heavy precipitation before another atmospheric river arrives next week, according to the National Weather Service.

Snowmelt may worsen flooding

With this new wave of storms pummeling areas already buried by heavy snowfall from the past two weeks, forecasters have warned that the melting snowpack will play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days.

Snow melt at elevations below 5,000 feet could particularly worsen the flooding in the Sierra, where accumulations of 3 to 5 feet are likely above 7,500 feet, the National Weather Service said.

""Heavy rain absorbed into the particularly deep snowpack in the Sierra Nevada along with heavy snow, measuring in feet above the 7500 feet, will further compound ongoing snow load impacts and issues,"" the National Weather Service said.

That doesn't necessarily mean the rain will fully melt the snow pack away.

During the last storm, the deep snow pack mostly absorbed more water than it melted, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said.

""There is more snow water in the southern and possibly central Sierra than there has ever been at this time of year and possibly at any point during the year especially in the southern Sierra. So there is a whole hell of a lot of water up there right now stored in the snowpack,"" Swain said.

More than 30 million people across the state were under flood alerts as the West's 11th atmospheric river of the season pushed into northern California and aimed towards central and southern California Tuesday, battering ground already saturated with water from the last round of rain and swollen rivers that have overflowed their banks.

The storm comes on the heels of another deadly atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose. This round can bring up to 8 inches of rain in some areas, with rainfall coming down as fast as 1 inch per hour.

There are scattered evacuation alerts across multiple counties, including in Monterey County where residents along the Salinas River were ordered to flee. Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties both issued evacuation warnings Monday night ahead of the atmospheric river's arrival in the south, with Santa Barbara officials saying the warnings will become orders in the morning.

""The forthcoming rainstorms cause concerns of localized flooding impacts to already damaged infrastructure and increased potential for debris flows and mudslides,"" the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management said in an email to CNN.

Already, over 600 Californians have taken refuge in 32 shelters across 13 counties and California National Guard troops are out helping with swift water rescues from deluged streets. Numerous roads statewide are closed and a river levee has been breached.

""We weren't expecting it to be as bad as we're seeing it,"" Monterey Mayor Tyller Williamson told CNN Monday.

Forty of the state's 58 counties are now under a state of emergency declaration ordered by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and crews positioned across the state are bracing for more overflowing rivers, floods, mudslides and impassable roads.

Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse says the storm is now predicted to be much more significant than originally thought.

""We will wait to see how the intensity plays out before authorizing any evacuations,"" Rowse said in an email. ""We feel prepared, but will maintain a high level of vigilance.""

The ""high-impact"" atmospheric river was expected to hit southern California Tuesday afternoon before beginning to taper off during Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service, which warns another round of major and life-threatening flooding is likely along much of the California coast, central Valley and Sierra foothills.

Meanwhile, as California is hammered with rain, another major winter storm is walloping the Northeast, where widespread heavy snowfall is likely from the northeast Pennsylvania and far northwest New Jersey area, through much of New York state and New England.

Swollen rivers are a concern as one levee breach widens

As intense rain wallops California, the National Weather Service warns that creeks and streams may rise out of their banks and fuel extensive street flooding.

""Lingering impacts from last week's flooding is likely to get worse with this second storm,"" the Weather Service said in a forecast message.

Parts of Monterey County -- including Salinas -- could get cut off by flooding on the Salinas River, officials said. Those at risk ""can and should seek shelter"" with family or friends or at one of the county's evacuation shelters, county officials said.

The Salinas River ""is looking at breaching one of the major highways that folks use to get to the peninsula and so we're just concerned in regards to the highway 68,"" Williamson said.

The storm also placed greater urgency on repairing a levee in Monterey County that was breached around midnight Friday by the swollen Pajaro River, forcing thousands to evacuate as water rushed into and flooded the nearby Pajaro community.

""It was 120 feet when the levee initially broke, and now it's expanded to 300 feet,"" Williamson said of the breach, calling it ""a significant issue.""

Crews are racing to shore up the breach with a temporary rock and sand wall to slow the flow of water into Pajaro. ""A permanent fix will be undertaken once this crisis has passed,"" Monterey County officials said.

""The situation is dynamic and evolving,"" said Flood Division Manager Jeremy Arrich, as construction crews work to stabilize the levee and engineers focus on short and long term fixes. The flood division is proactively reaching out to other levee managers throughout the region to ensure safety and stability in preparation for the incoming rain.

The recent atmospheric rivers are just the latest to inundate California after an onslaught of similar storms in December and January also resulted in deadly flooding -- and it isn't stopping here.

After this latest atmospheric river sweeps through California by Wednesday, the state will only get a few days of relief from heavy precipitation before another atmospheric river arrives next week, according to the National Weather Service.

Snowmelt may worsen flooding

With this new wave of storms pummeling areas already buried by heavy snowfall from the past two weeks, forecasters have warned that the melting snowpack will play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days.

Snow melt at elevations below 5,000 feet could particularly worsen the flooding in the Sierra, where accumulations of 3 to 5 feet are likely above 7,500 feet, the National Weather Service said.

""Heavy rain absorbed into the particularly deep snowpack in the Sierra Nevada along with heavy snow, measuring in feet above the 7500 feet, will further compound ongoing snow load impacts and issues,"" the National Weather Service said.

That doesn't necessarily mean the rain will fully melt the snow pack away.

During the last storm, the deep snow pack mostly absorbed more water than it melted, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said.

""There is more snow water in the southern and possibly central Sierra than there has ever been at this time of year and possibly at any point during the year especially in the southern Sierra. So there is a whole hell of a lot of water up there right now stored in the snowpack,"" Swain said.

More than 30 million people across the state were under flood alerts as the West's 11th atmospheric river of the season pushed into northern California and aimed towards central and southern California Tuesday, battering ground already saturated with water from the last round of rain and swollen rivers that have overflowed their banks.

The storm comes on the heels of another deadly atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose. This round can bring up to 8 inches of rain in some areas, with rainfall coming down as fast as 1 inch per hour.

There are scattered evacuation alerts across multiple counties, including in Monterey County where residents along the Salinas River were ordered to flee. Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties both issued evacuation warnings Monday night ahead of the atmospheric river's arrival in the south, with Santa Barbara officials saying the warnings will become orders in the morning.

""The forthcoming rainstorms cause concerns of localized flooding impacts to already damaged infrastructure and increased potential for debris flows and mudslides,"" the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management said in an email to CNN.

Already, over 600 Californians have taken refuge in 32 shelters across 13 counties and California National Guard troops are out helping with swift water rescues from deluged streets. Numerous roads statewide are closed and a river levee has been breached.

""We weren't expecting it to be as bad as we're seeing it,"" Monterey Mayor Tyller Williamson told CNN Monday.

Forty of the state's 58 counties are now under a state of emergency declaration ordered by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and crews positioned across the state are bracing for more overflowing rivers, floods, mudslides and impassable roads.

Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse says the storm is now predicted to be much more significant than originally thought.

""We will wait to see how the intensity plays out before authorizing any evacuations,"" Rowse said in an email. ""We feel prepared, but will maintain a high level of vigilance.""

The ""high-impact"" atmospheric river was expected to hit southern California Tuesday afternoon before beginning to taper off during Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service, which warns another round of major and life-threatening flooding is likely along much of the California coast, central Valley and Sierra foothills.

Meanwhile, as California is hammered with rain, another major winter storm is walloping the Northeast, where widespread heavy snowfall is likely from the northeast Pennsylvania and far northwest New Jersey area, through much of New York state and New England.

Swollen rivers are a concern as one levee breach widens

As intense rain wallops California, the National Weather Service warns that creeks and streams may rise out of their banks and fuel extensive street flooding.

""Lingering impacts from last week's flooding is likely to get worse with this second storm,"" the Weather Service said in a forecast message.

Parts of Monterey County -- including Salinas -- could get cut off by flooding on the Salinas River, officials said. Those at risk ""can and should seek shelter"" with family or friends or at one of the county's evacuation shelters, county officials said.

The Salinas River ""is looking at breaching one of the major highways that folks use to get to the peninsula and so we're just concerned in regards to the highway 68,"" Williamson said.

The storm also placed greater urgency on repairing a levee in Monterey County that was breached around midnight Friday by the swollen Pajaro River, forcing thousands to evacuate as water rushed into and flooded the nearby Pajaro community.

""It was 120 feet when the levee initially broke, and now it's expanded to 300 feet,"" Williamson said of the breach, calling it ""a significant issue.""

Crews are racing to shore up the breach with a temporary rock and sand wall to slow the flow of water into Pajaro. ""A permanent fix will be undertaken once this crisis has passed,"" Monterey County officials said.

""The situation is dynamic and evolving,"" said Flood Division Manager Jeremy Arrich, as construction crews work to stabilize the levee and engineers focus on short and long term fixes. The flood division is proactively reaching out to other levee managers throughout the region to ensure safety and stability in preparation for the incoming rain.

The recent atmospheric rivers are just the latest to inundate California after an onslaught of similar storms in December and January also resulted in deadly flooding -- and it isn't stopping here.

After this latest atmospheric river sweeps through California by Wednesday, the state will only get a few days of relief from heavy precipitation before another atmospheric river arrives next week, according to the National Weather Service.

Snowmelt may worsen flooding

With this new wave of storms pummeling areas already buried by heavy snowfall from the past two weeks, forecasters have warned that the melting snowpack will play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days.

Snow melt at elevations below 5,000 feet could particularly worsen the flooding in the Sierra, where accumulations of 3 to 5 feet are likely above 7,500 feet, the National Weather Service said.

""Heavy rain absorbed into the particularly deep snowpack in the Sierra Nevada along with heavy snow, measuring in feet above the 7500 feet, will further compound ongoing snow load impacts and issues,"" the National Weather Service said.

That doesn't necessarily mean the rain will fully melt the snow pack away.

During the last storm, the deep snow pack mostly absorbed more water than it melted, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said.

""There is more snow water in the southern and possibly central Sierra than there has ever been at this time of year and possibly at any point during the year especially in the southern Sierra. So there is a whole hell of a lot of water up there right now stored in the snowpack,"" Swain said.

California will be hit with a second atmospheric river this week as it braces for excessive rainfall and possibly flash floods through Wednesday morning.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

California will be hit with a second atmospheric river this week as it braces for excessive rainfall and possibly flash floods through Wednesday morning.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

California will be hit with a second atmospheric river this week as it braces for excessive rainfall and possibly flash floods through Wednesday morning.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

On Friday night, the swollen Pajaro River burst through the worn-down levee, flooding the entire town of Pajaro and sending its roughly 3,000 residents into what officials are now estimating to be a multi-month-long exile. A second breach was reported on Monday.

For decades, the levee was ignored by the federal government -- never rising to the status of a fix-worthy project -- despite repeated pleas, breaches, floods and even two deaths.

""Yeah, the money wasn't there because the prioritization wasn't there,"" said Mark Strudley, executive director of the Pajaro Regional Flood Management Agency.

And as the communities and local government agencies begged for help and funding, the levee aged, eroded and, in some places, sank.

The situation is by no means unique to Pajaro. Experts say similar weaknesses plague levee systems across California and the nation.

As climate change threatens to intensify and exacerbate extreme weather events -- such as flooding and even drought -- the unease and desperation of residents and emergency responders in communities near these crumbling systems is growing.

""We all know that there's a lot of economically disadvantaged communities that are built in natural disaster-prone areas,"" Strudley said. ""That's just the very unfortunate way the planning and development process has worked over the past 100 plus years in the United States.""

Throughout Northern California, the Central Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, there are more than 13,000 miles of levees designed to protect dry land from floods, deliver drinking water, and protect homes, businesses, and agriculture from flooding.

According to work by Farhid Vahedifard -- a professor of civil engineering at the University of Mississippi -- a high percentage were constructed by settlers in the mid- to late 19th century to protect agricultural lands from flooding.

""And they've been worn down, just like anything else,"" Strudley said. ""They have a limited life span.""

In most cases, Strudley and Vahedifard said, the levees were built with poorly compacted, unengineered mixtures of sandy, clayey and organic soils, material ""that was scraped up out of the riverbed and used for fill to build the levees,"" Strudley said.

In addition, they've suffered the wear-and-tear of time, rodents, seismic events and drought.

""These things leak long before they get overtopped,"" said Strudley, noting that one of the biggest problems is burrowing animals.

In 2011, the California Department of Water Resources examined Northern California's levee system. The evaluation considered about 1,800 miles of earthworks throughout the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins and found that more than half of the levees were what they considered ""high hazard"" -- indicating they were in danger of failing during an earthquake or flood event.

And that was before the megadrought, which dried out soils within the levees and underneath them -- causing the structures to weaken and lose strength, Vahedifard said.

Drought also hastened subsidence as water districts and users siphoned water from underground aquifers, depressing and sinking the land above.

But until recently, the federal government and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not see these systems -- particularly if they were in marginalized or economically disadvantaged communities -- as a priority.

""The federal funding system for levees and other life protection systems completely disadvantages federally disadvantaged communities, systemically,"" said Zach Friend, a Santa Cruz County supervisor whose district encompasses Watsonville and the northern side of the Pajaro River Valley.

He said what happened to the levee in Pajaro could have been prevented had resources been provided to the community to rebuild the levee -- something it had been requesting since the 1960s.

""The storms that came that blew out the levee ... are a five- to seven-year-interval storm,"" he said. ""So if our infrastructure can't even withhold what really is a relatively regular occurrence storm, climate change -- what we are seeing in the future and what it's going to do to disadvantaged communities -- is something beyond the pale.""

He said the cumulative effect of these storms and the ""weather whiplash"" between severe drought and severe storms ""really tests the possibility of how you even build for and plan for that level of resilience toward communities that have been under-invested in for the last 100 years and that are starting at a net negative rebuild.""

The levee failure on the Pajaro River points to larger hazards that California has yet to address in many areas where communities are vulnerable, said Deirdre Des Jardins, an independent water researcher and advocate.

Des Jardins has for years urged state and local officials to invest in flood protection infrastructure in areas that are at risk, and she has suggested an effective climate adaptation strategy should focus on ""measurable, actionable targets for protection of vulnerable populations.""

""You look at where to invest money to protect lives. And we're not doing that. We don't have quantifiable targets about protecting lives and protecting these vulnerable communities,"" De Jardins said.

In addition to rural communities like Pajaro, she said that Stockton and neighboring cities face major flood risks due to their reliance on inadequate levees with known seepage problems.

As the federal government continues to re-evaluate how it invests in major infrastructure projects in economically disadvantaged communities, the cost of doing nothing will continue to mount.

""How much flood risk is there in California? A bunch. The reason is pretty simple,"" said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. ""The economic consequences of even a modest flood are pretty high.""

He said this is especially the case in the L.A. Basin, where the growing likelihood of major flooding overlaps with the increasing value of surrounding properties.

""There is a long legacy of very bad flood management and land use choices along the L.A., San Gabriel and Santa Ana rivers,"" Mount said. ""That is an equation for high risk because eventually a flood will come and the economic costs will be immense.""

Local, state and federal officials have improved flood control infrastructure in the Sacramento area during the last two decades, which has reduced risk in the area, Mount said.

Still, many low-lying communities in the Central Valley face substantial flood risks. And many farms in and around the Delta sit below sea level, requiring levees to keep water out, Mount said.

""Our flood infrastructure is old,"" Mount said, ""and is designed for the hydrology of the past, not the future.

""This is going to be a major challenge going forward, particularly because we have increased the potential economic costs of flooding by our land use choices.""

In January, when levees failed along the Cosumnes and Mokelumne rivers and caused deadly flooding, Mount said those failures point to larger hazards. ""There are two kinds of levees: Those that have failed, and those that will fail,"" he said.

Mount said he is now especially concerned about the immense amount of snowmelt runoff expected from the central and southern Sierra this spring.",[],"[{'uri':

It's gone steadily down since then, although CNRFC models predict it will start creeping back up as rain picks up Tuesday morning. Models have the Pajaro River peaking early Wednesday afternoon. (Remember that rivers keep rising even after the rain has stopped, as melting snow and flowing tributaries keep pouring stormwater into the main-stem rivers for some time after.)

The river models update frequently, so you can keep checking back throughout the day to see where things stand.

This week's atmospheric river is expected to dump most of its rainfall by midday Tuesday, with showers lingering into the evening and Wednesday morning. The National Weather Service asks residents to stay off roadways, if possible, and be cautious of falling trees or debris. A flood watch is in effect for the Bay Area until late Tuesday.

""You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood Warnings,"" the weather service's Bay Area office said in a statement.

More than 30 million people across the state were under flood alerts as the West's 11th atmospheric river of the season pushed into northern California and aimed towards central and southern California Tuesday, battering ground already saturated with water from the last round of rain and swollen rivers that have overflowed their banks.

The storm comes on the heels of another deadly atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose. This round can bring up to 8 inches of rain in some areas, with rainfall coming down as fast as 1 inch per hour.

There are scattered evacuation alerts across multiple counties, including in Monterey County where residents along the Salinas River were ordered to flee. Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties both issued evacuation warnings Monday night ahead of the atmospheric river's arrival in the south, with Santa Barbara officials saying the warnings will become orders in the morning.

""The forthcoming rainstorms cause concerns of localized flooding impacts to already damaged infrastructure and increased potential for debris flows and mudslides,"" the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management said in an email to CNN.

Already, over 600 Californians have taken refuge in 32 shelters across 13 counties and California National Guard troops are out helping with swift water rescues from deluged streets. Numerous roads statewide are closed and a river levee has been breached.

""We weren't expecting it to be as bad as we're seeing it,"" Monterey Mayor Tyller Williamson told CNN Monday.

Forty of the state's 58 counties are now under a state of emergency declaration ordered by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and crews positioned across the state are bracing for more overflowing rivers, floods, mudslides and impassable roads.

Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse says the storm is now predicted to be much more significant than originally thought.

""We will wait to see how the intensity plays out before authorizing any evacuations,"" Rowse said in an email. ""We feel prepared, but will maintain a high level of vigilance.""

The ""high-impact"" atmospheric river was expected to hit southern California Tuesday afternoon before beginning to taper off during Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service, which warns another round of major and life-threatening flooding is likely along much of the California coast, central Valley and Sierra foothills.

Meanwhile, as California is hammered with rain, another major winter storm is walloping the Northeast, where widespread heavy snowfall is likely from the northeast Pennsylvania and far northwest New Jersey area, through much of New York state and New England.

Swollen rivers are a concern as one levee breach widens

As intense rain wallops California, the National Weather Service warns that creeks and streams may rise out of their banks and fuel extensive street flooding.

""Lingering impacts from last week's flooding is likely to get worse with this second storm,"" the Weather Service said in a forecast message.

Parts of Monterey County -- including Salinas -- could get cut off by flooding on the Salinas River, officials said. Those at risk ""can and should seek shelter"" with family or friends or at one of the county's evacuation shelters, county officials said.

The Salinas River ""is looking at breaching one of the major highways that folks use to get to the peninsula and so we're just concerned in regards to the highway 68,"" Williamson said.

The storm also placed greater urgency on repairing a levee in Monterey County that was breached around midnight Friday by the swollen Pajaro River, forcing thousands to evacuate as water rushed into and flooded the nearby Pajaro community.

""It was 120 feet when the levee initially broke, and now it's expanded to 300 feet,"" Williamson said of the breach, calling it ""a significant issue.""

Crews are racing to shore up the breach with a temporary rock and sand wall to slow the flow of water into Pajaro. ""A permanent fix will be undertaken once this crisis has passed,"" Monterey County officials said.

""The situation is dynamic and evolving,"" said Flood Division Manager Jeremy Arrich, as construction crews work to stabilize the levee and engineers focus on short and long term fixes. The flood division is proactively reaching out to other levee managers throughout the region to ensure safety and stability in preparation for the incoming rain.

The recent atmospheric rivers are just the latest to inundate California after an onslaught of similar storms in December and January also resulted in deadly flooding -- and it isn't stopping here.

After this latest atmospheric river sweeps through California by Wednesday, the state will only get a few days of relief from heavy precipitation before another atmospheric river arrives next week, according to the National Weather Service.

Snowmelt may worsen flooding

With this new wave of storms pummeling areas already buried by heavy snowfall from the past two weeks, forecasters have warned that the melting snowpack will play a role in prolonging flooding over the upcoming days.

Snow melt at elevations below 5,000 feet could particularly worsen the flooding in the Sierra, where accumulations of 3 to 5 feet are likely above 7,500 feet, the National Weather Service said.

""Heavy rain absorbed into the particularly deep snowpack in the Sierra Nevada along with heavy snow, measuring in feet above the 7500 feet, will further compound ongoing snow load impacts and issues,"" the National Weather Service said.

That doesn't necessarily mean the rain will fully melt the snow pack away.

During the last storm, the deep snow pack mostly absorbed more water than it melted, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said.

""There is more snow water in the southern and possibly central Sierra than there has ever been at this time of year and possibly at any point during the year especially in the southern Sierra. So there is a whole hell of a lot of water up there right now stored in the snowpack,"" Swain said.

California will be hit with a second atmospheric river this week as it braces for excessive rainfall and possibly flash floods through Wednesday morning.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

On Friday night, the swollen Pajaro River burst through the worn-down levee, flooding the entire town of Pajaro and sending its roughly 3,000 residents into what officials are now estimating to be a multi-month-long exile. A second breach was reported on Monday.

For decades, the levee was ignored by the federal government -- never rising to the status of a fix-worthy project -- despite repeated pleas, breaches, floods and even two deaths.

""Yeah, the money wasn't there because the prioritization wasn't there,"" said Mark Strudley, executive director of the Pajaro Regional Flood Management Agency.

And as the communities and local government agencies begged for help and funding, the levee aged, eroded and, in some places, sank.

The situation is by no means unique to Pajaro. Experts say similar weaknesses plague levee systems across California and the nation.

As climate change threatens to intensify and exacerbate extreme weather events -- such as flooding and even drought -- the unease and desperation of residents and emergency responders in communities near these crumbling systems is growing.

""We all know that there's a lot of economically disadvantaged communities that are built in natural disaster-prone areas,"" Strudley said. ""That's just the very unfortunate way the planning and development process has worked over the past 100 plus years in the United States.""

Throughout Northern California, the Central Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, there are more than 13,000 miles of levees designed to protect dry land from floods, deliver drinking water, and protect homes, businesses, and agriculture from flooding.

According to work by Farhid Vahedifard -- a professor of civil engineering at the University of Mississippi -- a high percentage were constructed by settlers in the mid- to late 19th century to protect agricultural lands from flooding.

Initial precipitation was light as the system spread across northern and central regions. But the National Weather Service said it was intensifying, and the heaviest rainfall was still offshore.

The system was expected to be a quick hit, rapidly moving from north to south. But authorities worried about runoff causing flooding because California's extraordinarily wet winter has left soils supersaturated.

So far this winter, the state has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers, long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean, as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off the runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday.

In California, more dangerous flooding was expected on the central coast, where a levee was breached as the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from an atmospheric river last week.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that is known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go, and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm was likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' effect on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

""Atmospheric river to bring significant impacts to the region today,"" National Weather Service forecasters warned on Tuesday morning. ""Strong damaging winds, power outages, additional flooding, and road closures are all anticipated. Avoid unnecessary travel.""

Saturated hillsides were already beginning to shift. The Bohemian Hwy south of Occidental in western Sonoma County was blocked by a slide early Tuesday.

A massive tree came crashing down in a Santa Rosa neighborhood, pulling down powerlines and cutting electricity to more than a dozen homes.

At San Francisco International Airport, nearly 100 flights had already been delayed by 7 a.m. High winds and downpours forced the FAA to issue a ground hold. Flights were being delayed by nearly 1 1/2 hours.

Forecasters said as the day unfolds winds will play a more prominent role in the weather onslaught. A high wind warning was in effect for the region until 11 p.m.

Also Read:

""Rain will increase in coverage and intensity through the remainder of the morning as a strengthening surface low approaches the northern and central California coast,"" weather service forecasters said. ""As such, southerly winds will strengthen to around at 25 to 40 mph with gusts to 50 mph. Gusts of up to 70 mph are expected along the coast, ridges, peaks and coastal gaps. Winds will be strongest between 4 a.m. and noon.""

A flood watch and a flood advisory have also been issued for the entire Bay Area. Monterey County remains the region will the most intense flooding.

Thousands have been driven from their homes. The weather service said the Pajaro River levee breach and the Salinas River would continue to run over their banks.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture has now grown to at least 400 feet since it failed late Friday, officials said.

More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that is known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go, and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' effect on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}},

Fox Weather details what is ahead for the west coast.

Heavy rainfall and flooding continued to impact California on Tuesday morning, as the state was hit by its eleventh atmospheric river since late December.

The National Weather Service said that more dangerous flooding was expected for central and southern California, urging residents to ""be prepared to act quickly.""

Rainfall and wind rates would continue to increase for the Bay Area and central coast, and the Los Angeles office for the agency warned of a high risk of excessive rainfall from Ventura County northward on Tuesday.

Forecasters warned of damaging wind and potential power outages from the storm. Outage tracker PowerOutage.US showed just more than 5,000 outages in the state.

CALIFORNIA FLOODING PROBLEMS GROW AS NEW STORM REACHES THE STATE

An evacuation order would take effect for some areas associated with wildfire burn scars in Santa Barbara County at 8 a.m. PT on Tuesday.

Siskiyou County - in the northernmost part of the state - also issued an evacuation warning for areas near the McKinney Fire burn scar, and the county's office of emergency services tweeted late Monday that there was a high probability debris flows and flooding exist.

This comes after more than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate last week after a levee break in Monterey. About 50 people had to be rescued while some residents stayed behind.

As of Monday, miles of the coastal Highway 1 were closed between Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Monterey officials also warned that the Salinas River could lead to significant flooding of roads and agricultural land. Undersheriff Keith Boyd said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the river because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Officials said Monday that a second breach opened up another 100 feet of the Pajaro levee closer to the coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for floodwaters.

The California Department of Water Resources has continued to release water from the Oroville Dam for flood control protection to downstream communities.

(AP) -- Steady rain fell Tuesday from California's latest atmospheric river storm fell as truckloads of rocks were brought to a broken river levee that unleashed floodwaters into central coast farmland and small agricultural communities.

At one end of the rupture on the muddy Pajaro River, a heavy earth-moving machine used its excavator bucket to press the rocks into the levee before big boulders were brought in to fill the gap that opened last weekend.

The new storm initially spread light to moderate rain over northern and central regions of the state. But the National Weather Service said it was moving more quickly than expected and most of the precipitation would shift southward.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders took effect at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows

So far this winter, the state has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers, long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean, as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off the runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday.

In California, flooding was expected to continue on the central coast, where the levee was breached as the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from an atmospheric river last week.

The rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the levee failure late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that is known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go, and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Water from the newest storm was likely to go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to reach the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' effect on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

WATSONVILLE, Calif. -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California has put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders as of Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

At one end of the muddy Pajaro River's ruptured levee, the long arm of a yellow earth-moving machine pressed rocks into place before big boulders were brought in to fill the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles south of San Francisco.

The new storm initially spread light to moderate rain over northern and central regions of the state. But the National Weather Service said it was moving more quickly than expected and most of the precipitation would shift southward.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders took effect at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.

The storm added to woes that have led to emergency declarations for 40 counties.

In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services.

So far this winter, the state has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers, long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean, as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off the runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday.

In California, flooding was expected to continue on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from an atmospheric river last week.

The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet since the failure late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops and that's now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go, and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Water from the newest storm was likely to go over the Pajaro's levee - but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to reach the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, and several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' effect on crops - both ones in the ground that are currently submerged and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

California will be hit with a second atmospheric river this week as it braces for excessive rainfall and possibly flash floods through Wednesday morning.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California has put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders as of Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

At one end of the muddy Pajaro River's ruptured levee, the long arm of a yellow earth-moving machine pressed rocks into place before big boulders were brought in to fill the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco.

The new storm initially spread light to moderate rain over northern and central regions of the state. But the National Weather Service said it was moving more quickly than expected and most of the precipitation would shift southward.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders took effect at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.

The storm added to woes that have led to emergency declarations for 40 counties.

In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services.

So far this winter, the state has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers, long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean, as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off the runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday.

In California, flooding was expected to continue on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from an atmospheric river last week.

The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the failure late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops and that's now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go, and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Water from the newest storm was likely to go over the Pajaro's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to reach the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, and several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' effect on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

The storm system, which began to move in from the Pacific late Monday and swept across the state on Tuesday morning, dumped more rain on a landscape already saturated with water. At higher elevations, the storm was piling more feet of snow on top of already groaning roofs, or wetting down the existing snowpack.

The storm was expected to create significant flooding as it spread across the Central Valley and into the Sierra Nevada foothills, the National Weather Service said -- a danger that would extend into Wednesday. There could be flooding even in areas that are not normally prone to it, endangering lives and property, the agency said.

The leading edge of the storm came ashore overnight in Northern California, and by late morning on Tuesday had begun to shift the brunt of its impact to the south. Up to four inches of rain was forecast for the Los Angeles Basin, where ""extensive street flooding"" was likely, the Weather Service said.

Officials up and down the state issued warnings for vulnerable spots. Santa Barbara County told people living near the burn scars of recent wildfires to evacuate, saying those areas could experience dangerous flooding and debris flow. Plumas County, north of Sacramento, warned residents living along the Feather River and in other low-lying areas to be ready to head for higher ground.

In Oceano, a neighborhood under an evacuation warning in San Luis Obispo County, residents said they were worried that a nearby levee, already damaged by storms in January, could fail, as one on the Pajaro River did on Saturday.

""If it does, it will flood here,"" Willie Reed, 44, said as sat on his front porch on Tuesday, watching the rain. Mr. Reed said that he and his fiancée had packed their bags and were ready to go. Near his house, ducks swam across a street already inundated with rain.

The American Red Cross has a shelter open in San Luis Obispo for evacuees, but as of noon no one had turned up there except reporters. ""We have not had one single person yet,"" said Michael Turk, the supervisor of the shelter. People who can stay with family or friends generally will choose to do that, Mr. Turk said, while ""we're here for the people that don't have options.""

Sections of highways and roads in some parts of the state were closed by rockslides, flooding and downed trees loosened by the wind and rain, the California Department of Transportation said. Officials warned motorists to avoid driving where moving water covered the pavement, noting that ""as little as one foot of water can sweep a car off the road.""

Schools were forced to close in a number of communities, especially along the Central Coast.

The storm's gusty winds -- reaching more than 80 miles an hour in some areas -- were toppling trees and snapping power lines, causing widespread power outages. As of Tuesday afternoon, roughly 330,000 utility customers were without power in California, according to PowerOutage.us. The winds caused flight delays at San Francisco International Airport, officials said.

The storm is the latest bout of severe weather in what is shaping up as one of the most ferocious California winters in memory. Previous storms have already forced some residents to evacuate from floods and trapped others in their homes beneath mounds of snow.

The southern portion of the Sierra Nevada now has what may be its deepest snowpack on record, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Scientists say this winter has already been the third snowiest on record for the central Sierra.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency this month covering several counties that have been ravaged by the recent storms, and President Biden has approved a federal emergency declaration as well.

""As long as they don't shut the gas off, we'll be OK,"" she said Tuesday.

Alvarez and her family, as well as her neighbor next door, were among a number of residents who chose not to evacuate the small migrant town that became flooded when the levee failed this past weekend, forcing hundreds of residents to flee their homes.

""I know some people criticize us for not leaving, but the flooding danger isn't here, it's somewhere else,"" Alvarez said, pointing south toward Salinas Road, which was submerged in water.

Standing nearby, her neighbor, Karla Loreto, 35, nodded in agreement.

""We're also not going to be wandering around in search of danger,"" Loreto said.

Alvarez said many families declined to leave because of what happened in January, when many in the town were evacuated. She said many residents returned to find that their homes had been broken into.

She stayed behind this time in part because of her husband's health. He has liver cancer and has to see his doctor once a week for chemotherapy. The next appointment is this coming Sunday.

""COVID poses a threat for him,"" Alvarez said. ""We can't be in a shelter right now, not with his immune system being so weak.""

""It's better for us to be here in our own home,"" she added, ""sleeping in our beds and eating the food we have in our fridge.""

The town looked lifeless. Sandbags sat on the entrances of bars, beauty salons and meat markets. Around the area, streets had turned into miniature lakes. The water covered the tires of parked cars; water gushed from underneath manhole coverings. Potatoes, lemons and food packaging debris lay on streets where the water had receded.

Alvarez glanced over at two sheriff's cruisers parked in the middle of the road near a bridge. She couldn't understand why they couldn't let residents back into upper-level apartments or away from the flooded areas. Why couldn't they let people go in and out to purchase water and food, she wondered? Or maybe just give them those necessities, she added.

""I'm from Mexico,"" she said. ""We're used to dealing with disasters there. We know how to survive, we just need a little support.""

Alvarez is no stranger to flooding here. She said in 1995, two years after arriving from Mexico, water blanketed the town.

""It took two months to return home,"" she recalled. ""Two months. Imagine coming back home and having to throw away all the food you had purchased and having no work?""

She felt the recent storms that had caused the leeve to breach were worse. The strawberries, cabbage and broccoli grown in the region were probably destroyed. Work would disappear again.

Loreto, her neighbor, glanced down at the parking lot below.

""I work at the gas station behind this building,"" she said, indicating the direction with her thumb. ""I don't know when they'll open that gas station.""

Pajaro was flooded last week during powerful storms that caused the levee to break. It could take months to make repairs in the migrant town near Watsonville. Now, another storm was moving in, bringing fresh anxieties.

Sheriff's cruisers and the National Guard patrolled the area. Reporters stood by flooded areas giving their news updates on television.

Pajaro had always been vulnerable because repairs were never prioritized, in part because officials did not believe it made financial sense to protect the low-income area, interviews and records show.

After the deluge in 1995, Alvarez recalled that officials said they would address the problem. They never did.

""We are the most hardworking people and we help this economy,"" she said.

Monterey and Santa Cruz county officials are considering a plan to relieve pressure on the Pajaro River flooding that would include cutting through Highway 1.

At risk from floodwaters are major utility lines, which run through the levee under Highway 1, and a wastewater treatment facility downstream.

Mark Strudley, executive director at Pajaro Regional Flood Management, said the water that is exiting the flood plain is flowing through a gap under Highway 1, which is located between a levee and the highway's embankment, ""so it's outside the river channel.""

Because of that, ""it's eating through the levee right there. It's eroding the levee from the flood plain side rather than the river side.""

Strudley said that major utilities -- including a sewage and water irrigation pipe -- run through the levee. So as the water eats away at the levee, the integrity of these utilities is threatened.

He said its location makes it thorny to fix -- the only way to access this gap is through a small, open area that runs between the north and southbound lanes of Highway 1.

And because the lanes run across a shallow bridge, an excavator can't be used to fix the erosion. And it would do no good to drop rocks or sand through the opening between the lanes, because that could potentially damage the utility lines.

""So, if the water continues to erode through the levee such that it reenters the river system... it could overwhelm the river system downstream of Highway 1. And notably, the feature that's immediately downstream is the wastewater treatment plant for the city of Watsonville, which is on the Santa Cruz County side,"" said Strudley.

He said if the water tops or seeps through the levee, ""we stand to destroy parts of the plant and may end up releasing untreated sewage to the flood plain to the river, and then ultimately, to the Monterey Bay.""

He said they have three options to deal with the situation.

""One thing you can do is open up the levee downstream of that point, a little ways downstream, but upstream of the wastewater treatment plant to let the water back out onto the flood plain,"" he said.

The second option ""is actually opening up Highway 1. Basically cutting through Highway 1 and the low spot which is to the south of the river and letting the water out of the flood plain.""

The last option, he said, is to do nothing.

The new storm hasn't hit as hard as expected -- so far -- so that may provide the relief needed.

He said a decision is likely going to be made Tuesday afternoon.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri':

(AP) -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California has put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders as of Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

At one end of the muddy Pajaro River's ruptured levee, the long arm of a yellow earth-moving machine pressed rocks into place before big boulders were brought in to fill the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco.

Forecasters warned of potentially damaging winds with gusts up to 70 mph (113 kph) and there were numerous reports of falling trees. Power outages hit more than 330,000 utility customers in northern and central areas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.

The new storm initially spread light to moderate rain over the state's north and center. But the National Weather Service said the storm was moving more quickly than expected and most of the precipitation would shift southward.

So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers -- long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean -- as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off a runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages Tuesday.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders began at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.

The storm added to woes that caused emergency declarations for 40 counties.

In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services.

More flooding was expected on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week's atmospheric river. Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the failure late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people were rescued as the water rose that night.

Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops, was largely flooded. Some residents of the largely Latino farmworker community stayed. Others went to an emergency shelter where they wondered what became of their homes.

""We live seven houses away from the river and the water level was six feet high, seven probably,"" said evacuee Andres Garcia. ""So we probably lost everything.""

A second 100-foot breach (30 meters) in the levee opened closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee was a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

""We had so many years of drought and they could've fixed the levee way back and they didn't,"" said Garcia, the Pajaro evacuee. ""This is the second time it happened. Back in 1995, same thing. We lost everything.""

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Highway 1, a main link between the two counties, was closed along with several other roads.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding, cutting off the city of Monterey and the rest of the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' effect on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

The redwood tree fell around 12:30 p.m. local time at Oak Avenue Elementary School in Los Altos in Santa Clara County, school officials said. A girl was taken by ambulance with her parents to a local hospital.

The incident occurred as the National Weather Service in San Francisco reported wind gusts as high as 70 mph midday Tuesday. Downed trees were also reported in neighboring Santa Cruz County.

More than 330,000 customers were without power in California Tuesday afternoon amid the heavy rains and high winds.

A wide swath of the state is currently under a flood watch, with a high flood risk for Southern California. Rainfall totals of two to four inches are expected in many areas along the southern California coast, with totals of up to six inches possible in the foothills and mountains. Rainfall rates of up to one inch per hour are possible during the peak of the storm.

Parts of Monterey County in northern California are also still underwater after a levee along the Pajaro River breached over the weekend, flooding the community of Pajaro.

The rain is expected to continue into Wednesday in Los Angeles and San Diego.

The atmospheric river is then expected to become the next cross-country storm. It is forecast to start pushing east on Wednesday, bringing heavy snow to the Colorado Rockies and rain for the desert Southwest, where parts of central Arizona are under a flood watch.

By Thursday, the snow will push into the plains of Nebraska and from Iowa to Wisconsin.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoioideae', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng':

""The real question today is about manually breaching a section to relieve pressure,"" said Zach Friend, a Santa Cruz County supervisor whose district includes Watsonville, which is now threatened by the swelling Pajaro River.

Only days ago, a levee breach along the river triggered massive flooding in the town of Pajaro, prompting dozens of water rescues and evacuation orders covering hundreds of residents. County and state officials have been working to stabilize the approximately 350-foot breach by laying rocks and boulders to prevent it from getting larger, but there is still no timeline for when it will be fixed.

""When these systems come in, and the system is already very wet, the flows really do not decrease for quite some time,"" Monterey County water resources engineer Shaunna Murray said during a news briefing.

Adding to the challenge is that water flowing through a gap under Highway 1, between a levee and the highway embankment, is ""outside the river channel"" and ""eroding the levee from the floodplain side rather than the river side,"" said Mark Strudley, executive director of the Pajaro Regional Flood Management Agency.

Among the possible solutions are cutting through Highway 1 to relieve pressure on the river, he said.

Major utilities including a sewage and water irrigation pipe run through the levee and are threatened by the erosion.

But its location makes it a thorny fix -- the only way to access the gap is through through a small, open area that runs between the north and southbound lanes of Highway 1.

And because the lanes run across a shallow bridge, an excavator can't be used to fix the erosion. In addition, it would do no good to drop rocks or sand through the opening between the lanes, because that could potentially damage the utility lines.

""If the water continues to erode through the levee such that it re-enters the river system ... it could overwhelm the river system downstream of Highway 1,"" where a wastewater treatment plant for Watsonville sits, Strudley said.

If the water overtops or seeps through the levee, ""we stand to destroy parts of the plant and may end up releasing untreated sewage to the floodplain, to the river and then ultimately to the Monterey Bay.""

Officials have three options to deal with the situation, Strudley said.

""One thing you can do is open up the levee downstream of that point -- a little ways downstream, but upstream of the wastewater treatment plant -- to let the water back out onto the floodplain,"" he said.

The second option ""is actually opening up Highway 1. Basically cutting through Highway 1 and the low spot, which is to the south of the river, and letting the water out of the floodplain.""

The last option, he said, is to do nothing, which could suffice because the storm didn't hit as hard as expected. A decision is likely going to be made Tuesday afternoon.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Levee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Flood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Santa Cruz County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Santa Cruz County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'California State Route 1'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'State of emergency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'County (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_river', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Atmospheric river'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watsonville,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Watsonville, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Watsonville, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(geography)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Channel (geography)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Public utility'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Engineer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Erosion'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floodplain', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Floodplain'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Water resources'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Irrigation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sewage'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County,_California', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey County, California'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Bay', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterey Bay'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sewage treatment'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sand'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bridge'}}]",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f0927d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2268+0+210/resize/1200x675!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2Fdd%2Fe5f2f74d469cbd2f9c31bfa68f64%2Fap23073607293664.jpg,eng-8468865,-0.04313725490196074,416531700,1,latimes.com,news,Los Angeles Times,"Pajaro River Levee Flood Santa Cruz County, California California State Route 1 State of emergency County (United States) Atmospheric river Watsonville, California Monterey, California Channel (geography) Public utility Engineer Erosion Floodplain Water resources Irrigation Sewage Monterey County, California Monterey Bay Sewage treatment Sand Bridge",United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,15,23,2023-03-14

(AP) -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

Forecasters warned of damaging winds with gusts up to 70 mph (113 kph), and there were numerous reports of falling trees. Power outages hit more than 330,000 utility customers in northern and central areas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.

Crews raced to stabilize the Pajaro River's ruptured levee Tuesday, placing rocks and boulders to finish filling the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Workers will then raise that portion's elevation to match the rest of the levee over the next few weeks to make it impermeable, officials said.

Tuesday's storm initially spread light to moderate rain over the state's north and center. But the National Weather Service said the storm was moving faster than expected and that most of the precipitation would shift southward.

""Even a small amount of rain could potentially have larger impacts,"" Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency said Tuesday during a news conference.

Gusting winds damaged windows in a San Francisco high-rise, causing glass to rain down and forcing evacuations from the building in the financial district. No injuries were immediately reported.

So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers -- long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean -- as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off a runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages Tuesday.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders began at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.

The storm caused emergency declarations for 40 counties.

In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters by Tuesday morning, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services. Updated figures were not immediately available.

More flooding was expected on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week's atmospheric river. Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday.

The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the failure late Friday, officials said. A roughly 20-foot (6.10-meter) gap remained Tuesday afternoon.

Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops, was largely flooded. More than 8,500 people were told to evacuate, and nearly 250 people have been rescued by first responders since Friday.

Some residents of the largely Latino farmworker community stayed. One shelter was already full by midday Tuesday, and officials were forced to open two more to accommodate the evacuees.

""We live seven houses away from the river and the water level was six feet high, seven probably,"" said evacuee Andres Garcia. ""So we probably lost everything.""

A second 100-foot (30-meter) breach in the levee opened closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee was a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

""We had so many years of drought and they could've fixed the levee way back and they didn't,"" said Garcia, the Pajaro evacuee. ""This is the second time it happened. Back in 1995, same thing. We lost everything.""

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Highway 1, a main link between the two counties, was closed along with several other roads.

The storm caused emergency declarations for 40 counties.

In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters by Tuesday morning, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services. Updated figures were not immediately available.

More flooding was expected on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week's atmospheric river. Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday.

The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the failure late Friday, officials said. A roughly 20-foot (6.10-meter) gap remained Tuesday afternoon.

Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops, was largely flooded. More than 8,500 people were told to evacuate, and nearly 250 people have been rescued by first responders since Friday.

Some residents of the largely Latino farmworker community stayed. One shelter was already full by midday Tuesday, and officials were forced to open two more to accommodate the evacuees.

""We live seven houses away from the river and the water level was six feet high, seven probably,"" said evacuee Andres Garcia. ""So we probably lost everything.""

A second 100-foot (30-meter) breach in the levee opened closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee was a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

""We had so many years of drought and they could've fixed the levee way back and they didn't,"" said Garcia, the Pajaro evacuee. ""This is the second time it happened. Back in 1995, same thing. We lost everything.""

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Highway 1, a main link between the two counties, was closed along with several other roads.

(AP) -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

Forecasters warned of damaging winds with gusts up to 70 mph (113 kph), and there were numerous reports of falling trees. Power outages hit more than 330,000 utility customers in northern and central areas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.

Crews raced to stabilize the Pajaro River's ruptured levee Tuesday, placing rocks and boulders to finish filling the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Workers will then raise that portion's elevation to match the rest of the levee over the next few weeks to make it impermeable, officials said.

Tuesday's storm initially spread light to moderate rain over the state's north and center. But the National Weather Service said the storm was moving faster than expected and that most of the precipitation would shift southward.

""Even a small amount of rain could potentially have larger impacts,"" Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency said Tuesday during a news conference.

Gusting winds damaged windows in a San Francisco high-rise, causing glass to rain down and forcing evacuations from the building in the financial district. No injuries were immediately reported.

So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers -- long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean -- as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off a runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages Tuesday.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders began at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.

Then pools bubbled up on beyond the levee walls, spreading toward darkened fields of strawberries and lettuce. Four miles downstream, the farmworker community of Pajaro slept.

Within half an hour, according to Mark Strudley, the Pajaro Regional Flood Management Agency's executive director, sandbag crews were swarming the scene in ""full flood fight."" But in the latest example of how California's vast and aging infrastructure is being tested by this year's onslaught of extreme winter weather, the crews could not keep up.

As they backed away, the river burst with a mighty roar through the worn-down levee, flooding freeways and farms, submerging the entire town of Pajaro and forcing thousands of residents in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties to flee.

""I have to start from zero,"" Antonio Arroyo, a 58-year-old farmworker, said on Tuesday as he sat in an evacuation center at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds with about 300 displaced residents from the same community, known for harvesting strawberries. He had been sleeping in a Honda minivan when firefighters rescued him from the rising floodwaters in Pajaro; the donated red sneakers, blue jeans, sweater and plaid shirt he was wearing were ""all I have,"" he said.

As a fresh atmospheric river ravaged California on Tuesday, triggering flood watches and warnings from Southern California to the Oregon border, water experts warned that the recent storms could be just a prelude to an even more challenging spring.

Already, the landscape is beyond saturated after a winter that has set or approached records for precipitation. By Tuesday afternoon, heavy rain reached the Los Angeles Basin, where officials warned residents to avoid driving through flooded roadways and fire authorities said they rescued eight people and eight dogs from the San Gabriel River in Azusa late Monday.

In the Bay Area and Central Coast, strong winds downed power lines and tall trees. More than 350,000 utility customers were without power at one point on Tuesday, most of them customers of Pacific Gas and Electric in hard-hit Northern California, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks blackouts. Gusts of up to 74 miles per hour were recorded at San Francisco International Airport, where operations were paused briefly after the F.A.A. issued a ground stop.

More than 1,500 dams and some 14,000 miles of levees help control California's waterways, according to federal statistics. And this year's storms are capping the driest three years on record, noted Gary Lippner, deputy director of dam safety and flood management with the state's Department of Water Resources.

""California,"" he said, ""has experienced true climate whiplash this year.""

Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow specializing in water at the Public Policy Institute of California, a research organization, said that the cumulative effect of this winter's back-to-back storms had left California in ""uncharted territory,"" particularly in the southern Sierra Nevada, where the water content of the snowpack was the largest ever recorded.

They hope to raise $11 million to refurbish it.

As the snowpack melts, he said, and dam managers are forced to release water from fast-filling reservoirs to make room for incoming rain, flood-prone communities could become overwhelmed.

""It is worth remembering that almost all of our flood management infrastructure is more than a half-century old and designed around the climate of the past,"" Mr. Mount said on Tuesday in an email.

""While we have had many discussions about adapting to droughts of the future -- and are making progress -- we are still in the most nascent stages of thinking about how to adapt to larger floods.""

Statewide, the winter storms have stressed the state's infrastructure since January, particularly in low-lying, inland areas crisscrossed by rivers. Along the Cosumnes River near Sacramento, where more than a dozen levee breaches flooded roads and inundated homes during storms around New Year's Day, communities are still recovering.

To the north of the State Capitol, the authorities who maintain the watershed that encompasses the Sacramento International Airport said that when one of their pumps exploded this year during a powerful storm system, they discovered that their equipment was so old that the manufacturer no longer carried the parts they needed to fix it.

""We managed to get it back online with a $600 part we found on eBay,"" said Kevin L. King, the general manager of Reclamation District No. 1000, an agency formed to maintain levees and protect acreage from flooding. ""We were within 12 to 24 hours of telling the airport to reroute flights because there would have been water flooding the runways.""

Mr. Strudley said that federal, state and local officials had talked since the 1960s about the need to shore up the water infrastructure around the Pajaro River, but the property values in the area were so low that they did not meet the threshold for repair under the cost-benefit formula that the federal government and the Army Corps of Engineers were using.

That approach, which systemically disadvantaged poorer communities, has begun to change, he said. A major project to upgrade and strengthen the local levees at an estimated cost of more than $500 million was underway when the storm hit, and the flood has prompted local officials to begin talks with the federal government about expediting its planned 2025 groundbreaking, Mr. Strudley said.

Even so, he added, the project is expected to take eight to 10 years.

In Watsonville, across the river from their community of Pajaro, displaced farmworkers said it was unclear how long they could hold out with both their homes and the fields they depend on for paychecks underwater. Some said they had been living in their cars for days, not knowing where to go.

The working-class agricultural region is tucked between the beaches of Santa Cruz that are popular with surfers, and the wealthy Monterey Peninsula known for its world-class Pebble Beach Golf Links. Often cloaked in fog near the coastline of the Pacific Ocean, workers in the Pajaro Valley pick strawberries and harvest lettuce and artichokes savored by the rest of the nation.

Marina Hernandez, 31, said she received a knock on the door just after midnight on Saturday from a county worker saying her family had an hour to evacuate. She called her husband, who was working an overnight shift about 20 miles away at a garlic packing plant in Gilroy, and then quickly collected important documents, like birth certificates and Social Security cards.

But she said county officials did not tell her where to find shelter, so she and her family were living for a few days in their pickup truck. ""All they said was: 'Get out! Get out!' But they didn't tell us where to go. Nothing.""

Finally, after being sent away from the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds because the evacuation center was over capacity, she found her way on Tuesday afternoon to a small shelter set up in the gymnasium of a veterans hall in Watsonville.

Sitting on a cot with her 14-month-old daughter as her 5-year-old son lay playing with his phone on another cot, Ms. Hernandez said she was sad and frustrated and had no idea the condition of her home.

Weeks might pass, she said, before she and her family could go back. Until then, she said, ""I'm not able to do anything.""

""As long as they don't shut the gas off, we'll be OK,"" she said.

Alvarez, 54, and her family were among the residents who chose not to evacuate Pajaro, the small migrant town that flooded when a levee on the Pajaro River failed late Friday, forcing hundreds of people to flee their homes.

""I know some people criticize us for not leaving, but the flooding danger isn't here, it's somewhere else,"" Alvarez said, pointing south toward Salinas Road, which was submerged in water.

Standing nearby, her neighbor Karla Loreto, 35, nodded in agreement.

""We're also not going to be wandering around in search of danger,"" Loreto said.

The town has in many ways become ground zero for the latest atmospheric river storm walloping California, the 11th of the season so far.

The storm has dropped even more rain and snow on the beleaguered state and sent thousands of residents racing from rising waters. By Tuesday evening, about 336,000 households were without power, and 70 flood watches and warnings were in effect.

Pajaro -- a small town of about 3,000 people, many of them migrant farmworkers -- may not recover for a long time.

""Areas that were flooded and remain flooded are still under an evacuation order, so therefore it's not going to be a matter of days,"" Nicholas Pasculli, a Monterey County spokesperson, said during a news briefing. ""We want people to get back into their homes as soon as possible, and we're going to do whatever we can to make that happen, but there's going to be cases, without a doubt, that people will not be able to return to some of their homes.""

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

Hundreds of thousands in waterlogged California are without power and hundreds of people are in shelters as the latest atmospheric river sweeps though the state with ferocious hurricane-force winds and drenches already flooded neighborhoods.

It's the 11th atmospheric river - a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose - to inundate California this winter season, arriving on the heels of another storm that hit central California particularly hard.

The state will get just a few days of reprieve after the storm tapers off Wednesday before yet another atmospheric river arrives next week, the National Weather Service warns.

For now, about 30 million people across California remain under flood alerts as the storm wallops the state with repeated rounds of heavy rain and mountain snow, with rain pummeling already saturated land, threatening more dangerous floods and mudslides.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded a state of emergency to cover 43 of the state's 58 counties Tuesday night as high winds wrought havoc in the state, downing trees and power lines.

The combination of strong winds and heavy rain left over 270,500 homes and businesses without power across California, many of them in Santa Clara County south of San Francisco, according to PowerOutage.US.

The wind was so strong it is suspected to have sent glass falling from a downtown San Francisco high-rise building.

The San Francisco Bay area's public transit system, known as BART, was also being heavily impacted by the storm Tuesday. ""Most of our impacts on service have been due to high winds toppling trees and fallen branches entering our trackway,"" BART spokeswoman Cheryl Stalter tells CNN.

Top wind gusts of 74 mph were measured at San Francisco Airport, 97 mph at Santa Clara County's Loma Prieta and 93 mph at Alameda County's Mines Tower, according to the National Weather Service.

The storm has forced many people out of their homes as officials worried about mudslides from fire-scarred areas, overflowing rivers and dangerous road conditions.

More than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and nearly another 27,000 were under evacuation orders across the state as of Tuesday morning, California Governor's Office of Emergency Services spokesman Gustavo Ortiz told CNN.

Evacuation alerts remain in several counties Wednesday, including for those near the swollen Salinas and Pajaro rivers in Monterey County. To the south, residents near wildfire burn scars in Los Angeles County were under evacuation warnings.

In Placer County, a mudslide Tuesday evening caused major damage to a home in Colfax, prompting an evacuation warning for other homes, according to the CAL FIRE Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit.

Statewide, hundreds of people were taking refuge in dozens of shelters across multiple counties, according to state officials.

The heaviest rain is continuing to shift southward and will impact areas from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles and San Diego through early Wednesday morning.

Many of those who've had to leave their homes are from Monterey County, where crews are racing to repair a breach in a river levee that sent water rushing into a nearby community of Pajaro overnight Friday.

More than 2,000 people have also been evacuated from the Pajaro area, Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said.

Water from another breach in the area eroded nearby bridges and flowed into Highway 1 - a major highway that had to be shuttered, Monterey County officials said.

Video from Pajaro shows the community still looking like a lake, with floodwater reaching all the way to cars' doorhandles. More than 239 people have been rescued in the Pajaro area, with crews using high-water vehicles and boats to pull people from floodwater, Nieto said.

One Pajaro resident drove to the outskirts of town to see her home for the first time since evacuating Saturday morning. She found the bottom level of her home and the garage under water, she told CNN affiliate KSBW.

""I want to cry but what's crying going to do? It's just sad, so sad,"" Michelle Keith told KSBW.

Another Pajaro resident, Ruth Ruiz, hasn't been able to return home since she left in hurry before dawn Saturday and was worried about how long it'll take to get back to normal life after evacuation orders are lifted.

""We don't really have a plan. We're just taking it day by day. But we have a feeling it's going to be months before even insurance can cover any damages,"" Ruiz told CNN affiliate KPIX.

Crews were making progress filling the gaps in the levee Tuesday, racing to stem the flow of water from the breach.

""We caught a little bit of a break, the modeling changed from last night to this morning as we talked about,"" Sheriff Nieto said. ""Some of the precipitation we thought was going to be dumped into Monterey County has shifted south of us towards Paso Robles and into the Santa Barbara area.""

California has been hit with an unrelenting barrage of atmospheric rivers that brought deadly flooding to the state this winter season, and this latest one won't be the last.

Once this storm system moves out Wednesday, the state will get a few days of relief before another atmospheric river arrives, the National Weather Service said.

Heavy rain, melting snowpack, saturated soils and swollen streams may lead to prolonged flooding concerns and the potential for shallow landslides in some areas of California,"" the Weather Service said.

More rain, snow, high winds and flooding could be on the forecast for much of California from March 21 to March 23, forecasters said.

Atmospheric rivers are typically 250 to 375 miles wide and can stretch more than a thousand miles long, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.

While they're an important source of rainfall for the West, atmospheric rivers can create conditions similar to those of hurricanes when they pass over land, according to NOAA.

Due to the effects of global warming, scientists believe atmospheric rivers can become more intense as the air temperatures increase.

Atmospheric rivers will be ""significantly longer and wider than the ones we observe today, leading to more frequent atmospheric river conditions in affected areas,"" a NASA-led study found.

Another atmospheric river is walloping storm-ravaged California, inundating cities already flooded by recent rain and forcing residents to flee -- or risk not getting help if they need it.

About 30 million people across the state were under flood alerts as the 11th atmospheric river to hit the West this season slammed Northern California on Monday and took aim at central and Southern California on Tuesday.

""We weren't expecting it to be as bad as we're seeing it,"" Monterey Mayor Tyller Williamson said.

Rain could fall as fast as 1 inch per hour in some places -- which could result in significant flash flooding. The two areas of most concern are along the central California coast between Monterey and Santa Barbara counties, as well as parts of the Sierra Nevada foothills near Fresno to Bakersfield.

The atmospheric river also brought hurricane-force wind gusts to parts of central California Tuesday, along with widespread rainfall totals of up to 3 inches -- and nearly half a foot in some areas. A high wind warning was in effect for almost 15 million people in the state.

High winds were causing flight cancellations and delays at San Francisco International Airport Tuesday, with about 33% of flights affected, airport spokesperson Doug Yakel told CNN.

Many parts of California haven't recovered from last week's deadly atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose.

Heavily saturated soil can't soak up much more water, and melting snow could amplify dangerous flooding.

""The forthcoming rainstorms cause concerns of localized flooding impacts to already damaged infrastructure and increased potential for debris flows and mudslides,"" the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management told CNN.

More than 360,000 residences and businesses were without electricity Tuesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.US. Many of the outages -- just over 130,000 -- were in Santa Clara County.

As of Tuesday morning, more than 70,000 people were under evacuation warnings and almost 17,000 were under orders to evacuate, California Governor's Office of Emergency Services spokesperson Gustavo Ortiz told CNN.

The alerts affect residents in several counties:

* Santa Barbara County issued an evacuation warning Monday night for southern parts of the county and said it planned to upgrade the alert to an evacuation order on Tuesday. Those who refuse to heed the order might be on their own if they get trapped, the county warned.

""BE PREPARED to sustain yourself and your households for multiple days if you choose not to evacuate, as you may not be able to leave the area and emergency responders may not be able to access your property in the event of road damage, flooding, or a debris flow,"" the county said in a written notice.

* The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office issued an evacuation order Tuesday for parts of the county. ""An evacuation order means you should leave immediately,"" the sheriff's office warned.

* An evacuation alert was issued for parts of Monterey County, where residents along the Salinas River were ordered to flee.

* In Los Angeles County, ""Due to increased potential for debris flows and mudslides, the County has issued several evacuation warnings in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County that have burn scarring from recent wildfires,"" the office of emergency management said.

FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES

More than 600 Californians have taken refuge in 32 shelters across 13 counties, the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services said.

'Extensive street flooding is likely'

Los Angeles County is the nation's most populous county, with about 10 million residents. But some of those residents could find their neighborhoods under water.

""Heavy rain and excessive runoff may result in dangerous flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,"" the National Weather Service's local office said.

""Extensive street flooding is likely. There may be mudslides and rockslides, especially in and near steep terrain.""

Across California, 40 of the state's 58 counties were under a state of emergency. Crews positioned across the state are bracing for more overflowing rivers, floods, mudslides and impassable roads.

A wave of life-threatening flooding is likely along much of the coast, central Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills, the National Weather Service said.

The ""high-impact"" atmospheric river was expected to thrash Southern California on Tuesday afternoon before starting to taper off Wednesday, forecasters said.

A levee breach widens, threatening more flooding

Crews are racing to patch up a broken levee in Monterey County that was breached Friday by the swollen Pajaro River -- forcing thousands to evacuate as water flooded the nearby community.

""It was 120 feet when the levee initially broke, and now it's expanded to 300 feet,"" the mayor of Monterey said Monday.

Engineers are focusing on short- and long-term fixes. ""The situation is dynamic and evolving,"" said Jeremy Arrich, manager of the division of flood management for California's Department of Water Resources.

For now, crews are trying to use a temporary rock-and-sand wall to slow the flow of water into Pajaro.

""A permanent fix will be undertaken once this crisis has passed,"" Monterey County officials said.

Aside from the Pajaro River, the bloated Salinas River ""is looking at breaching one of the major highways that folks use to get to the (Monterey) Peninsula,"" said Williamson, the Monterey mayor.

It's not clear how badly Highway 68 will get hit. But some Monterey Peninsula residents could soon find themselves on a virtual island, cut off by floodwater.

'A whole hell of a lot of water' packed in snow

This new wave of storms is pummeling areas already buried by heavy snowfall from the past two weeks.

Now, snowmelt could exacerbate flooding in the Sierra Nevada, where there's likely 3 to 5 feet of snow at elevations higher than 7,500 feet, the National Weather Service said.

During the last storm, the deep snowpack generally absorbed more water than it melted, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said.

""There is more snow water in the southern and possibly central Sierra than there has ever been at this time of year -- and possibly at any point during the year, especially in the southern Sierra,"" Swain said.

""So there is a whole hell of a lot of water up there right now stored in the snowpack.""

Yet another atmospheric river is on the way

After this system, another atmospheric river is expected to hit the West Coast next week.

""Heavy rain, melting snowpack, saturated soils, and swollen streams may lead to prolonged flooding concerns and the potential for shallow landslides in some areas of California,"" the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center said.

""High winds could lead to coastal erosion and may exacerbate localized flooding.""

From severe flooding to long droughts, water-related disasters have intensified over the past two decades as global temperatures climbed to record levels, new research shows.

Across the country, another major winter storm is walloping the Northeast. Widespread, heavy snowfall is forecast from northeast Pennsylvania through much of New York state and New England.

The Air Force Reserve ""Hurricane Hunters"" are flying missions in both the atmospheric river on the West Coast and the nor'easter on the East Coast, collecting data to help improve the forecast for those regions impacted by the storms.

Until the last few years, forecasters had to rely solely on satellites and forecast models for forecasting atmospheric rivers -- which can become very muddy without truly knowing what's happening inside the storms.

Now, the University of California, San Diego, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes have teamed up with the Hurricane Hunters, who are able to drop instruments called ""dropsondes"" inside an atmospheric river to relay pinpointed live weather data.

The information is immediately put into weather forecast models, which drastically improves the accuracy of the forecast.

California will be hit with a second atmospheric river this week as it braces for excessive rainfall and possibly flash floods through Wednesday morning.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

California will be hit with a second atmospheric river this week as it braces for excessive rainfall and possibly flash floods through Wednesday morning.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

Hundreds of thousands in flood-ravaged California are without power and hundreds of people are in shelters as the latest atmospheric river sweeps though the state with ferocious hurricane-force winds and drenches already flooded neighborhoods.

The wind was so strong it is suspected to have sent glass falling from a downtown San Francisco high-rise building and toppled trees and power lines across the state.

The San Francisco Bay area's public transit system, known as BART, was also being heavily impacted by the storm Tuesday. ""Most of our impacts on service have been due to high winds toppling trees and fallen branches entering our trackway,"" BART spokeswoman Cheryl Stalter tells CNN.

Top wind gusts of 74 mph were measured at San Francisco Airport, 97 mph at Santa Clara County's Loma Prieta and 93 mph at Alameda County's Mines Tower, according to the National Weather Service.

The combination of strong winds and heavy rain also left over 206,000 homes and businesses without power across California early Wednesday, many of them in Santa Clara County south of San Francisco, according to PowerOutage.US.

About 30 million people across California remain under flood alerts as the storm wallops the state with repeated rounds of heavy rain and mountain snow, with rain pummeling already saturated land, threatening more dangerous floods and mudslides.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded a state of emergency to cover 43 of the state's 58 counties Tuesday night as high winds and intense rain wrought havoc in the state.

This is the 11th atmospheric river - a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose - to inundate California this winter season, arriving on the heels of another storm that hit central California particularly hard.

The state will get just a few days of reprieve after this storm tapers off Wednesday before yet another atmospheric river arrives next week, the National Weather Service warns.

The back-to-back storms have forced many people out of their homes as officials worried about mudslides from fire-scarred areas, overflowing rivers and dangerous road conditions.

More than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and nearly another 27,000 were under evacuation orders across the state as of Tuesday morning, California Governor's Office of Emergency Services spokesman Gustavo Ortiz told CNN.

Statewide, hundreds of people were taking refuge in dozens of shelters across multiple counties Tuesday, according to state officials.

Evacuation alerts remain in several counties Wednesday, including for those near the swollen Salinas and Pajaro rivers in Monterey County. To the south, residents near wildfire burn scars in Los Angeles County were under evacuation warnings.

In Placer County, a mudslide Tuesday evening caused major damage to a home in Colfax, prompting an evacuation warning for other homes, according to the CAL FIRE Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit.

The heaviest rain is continuing to shift southward and will impact areas from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles and San Diego through early Wednesday morning.

Many of those who've had to leave their homes are from Monterey County, where crews are racing to repair a breach in a river levee that sent water rushing into a nearby community of Pajaro overnight Friday.

More than 2,000 people have also been evacuated from the Pajaro area, Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said.

Water from another breach in the area eroded nearby bridges and flowed into Highway 1 - a major highway that had to be shuttered, Monterey County officials said.

Video from Pajaro shows the community still looking like a lake, with floodwater reaching all the way to cars' doorhandles. More than 239 people have been rescued in the Pajaro area, with crews using high-water vehicles and boats to pull people from floodwater, Nieto said.

One Pajaro resident drove to the outskirts of town to see her home for the first time since evacuating Saturday morning. She found the bottom level of her home and the garage under water, she told CNN affiliate KSBW.

""I want to cry but what's crying going to do? It's just sad, so sad,"" Michelle Keith told KSBW.

Another Pajaro resident, Ruth Ruiz, hasn't been able to return home since she left in hurry before dawn Saturday and was worried about how long it'll take to get back to normal life after evacuation orders are lifted.

""We don't really have a plan. We're just taking it day by day. But we have a feeling it's going to be months before even insurance can cover any damages,"" Ruiz told CNN affiliate KPIX.

Crews were making progress filling the gaps in the levee Tuesday, racing to stem the flow of water from the breach.

""We caught a little bit of a break, the modeling changed from last night to this morning as we talked about,"" Sheriff Nieto said. ""Some of the precipitation we thought was going to be dumped into Monterey County has shifted south of us towards Paso Robles and into the Santa Barbara area.""

California has been hit with an unrelenting barrage of atmospheric rivers that brought deadly flooding to the state this winter season, and this latest one won't be the last.

Once this storm system moves out Wednesday, the state will get a few days of relief before another atmospheric river arrives, the National Weather Service said.

Heavy rain, melting snowpack, saturated soils and swollen streams may lead to prolonged flooding concerns and the potential for shallow landslides in some areas of California,"" the Weather Service said.

More rain, snow, high winds and flooding could be on the forecast for much of California from March 21 to March 23, forecasters said.

Atmospheric rivers are typically 250 to 375 miles wide and can stretch more than a thousand miles long, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.

While they're an important source of rainfall for the West, atmospheric rivers can create conditions similar to those of hurricanes when they pass over land, according to NOAA.

Due to the effects of global warming, scientists believe atmospheric rivers can become more intense as the air temperatures increase.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

Damaging winds with gusts topping 70 mph (113 kph) blew out windows, and there were numerous reports of falling trees. Power outages hit more than 330,000 utility customers in northern and central areas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.

Crews raced to stabilize the Pajaro River's ruptured levee Tuesday, placing rocks and boulders to finish filling the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Workers will then raise that portion's elevation to match the rest of the levee over the next few weeks to make it impermeable, officials said.

Tuesday's storm initially spread light to moderate rain over the state's north and center. But the National Weather Service said the storm was moving faster than expected and that most of the precipitation would shift southward.

""Even a small amount of rain could potentially have larger impacts,"" Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency said Tuesday during a news conference.

Powerful winds damaged windows in a San Francisco high-rise, causing glass to rain down and forcing evacuations from the building in the financial district. No injuries were immediately reported. A gust of 74 mph (119 kph) was recorded at the city's airport, the weather service said.

So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers -- long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean -- as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off a runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages Tuesday.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders began at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.

The storm caused emergency declarations for 40 counties.

In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters by Tuesday morning, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services. Updated figures were not immediately available.

More flooding was expected on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week's atmospheric river. Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday.

The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the failure late Friday, officials said. A roughly 20-foot (6.10-meter) gap remained Tuesday afternoon.

Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops, was largely flooded. More than 8,500 people were told to evacuate, and nearly 250 people have been rescued by first responders since Friday.

Some residents of the largely Latino farmworker community stayed. One shelter was already full by midday Tuesday, and officials were forced to open two more to accommodate the evacuees.

""We live seven houses away from the river and the water level was six feet high, seven probably,"" said evacuee Andres Garcia. ""So we probably lost everything.""

A second 100-foot (30-meter) breach in the levee opened closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee was a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

""We had so many years of drought and they could've fixed the levee way back and they didn't,"" said Garcia, the Pajaro evacuee. ""This is the second time it happened. Back in 1995, same thing. We lost everything.""

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Highway 1, a main link between the two counties, was closed along with several other roads.

California will be hit with a second atmospheric river this week as it braces for excessive rainfall and possibly flash floods through Wednesday morning.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.

The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.

Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.

""Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that's why there's still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don't know where to go and don't have money to provide for themselves.""

A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.

Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee -- but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.

Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.

Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.

The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.

Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.

Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops -- both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.

Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.

""The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.

Last week's atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.

But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

Damaging winds with gusts topping 70 mph (113 kph) blew out windows, and there were numerous reports of falling trees. Power outages hit more than 330,000 utility customers in northern and central areas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.

Crews raced to stabilize the Pajaro River's ruptured levee Tuesday, placing rocks and boulders to finish filling the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Workers will then raise that portion's elevation to match the rest of the levee over the next few weeks to make it impermeable, officials said.

Tuesday's storm initially spread light to moderate rain over the state's north and center. But the National Weather Service said the storm was moving faster than expected and that most of the precipitation would shift southward.

""Even a small amount of rain could potentially have larger impacts,"" Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency said Tuesday during a news conference.

Powerful winds damaged windows in a San Francisco high-rise, causing glass to rain down and forcing evacuations from the building in the financial district. No injuries were immediately reported. A gust of 74 mph (119 kph) was recorded at the city's airport, the weather service said.

So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers -- long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean -- as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off a runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages Tuesday.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders began at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.

The storm caused emergency declarations for 40 counties.

In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters by Tuesday morning, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services. Updated figures were not immediately available.

More flooding was expected on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week's atmospheric river. Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday.

The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the failure late Friday, officials said. A roughly 20-foot (6.10-meter) gap remained Tuesday afternoon.

Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops, was largely flooded. More than 8,500 people were told to evacuate, and nearly 250 people have been rescued by first responders since Friday.

Some residents of the largely Latino farmworker community stayed. One shelter was already full by midday Tuesday, and officials were forced to open two more to accommodate the evacuees.

""We live seven houses away from the river and the water level was six feet high, seven probably,"" said evacuee Andres Garcia. ""So we probably lost everything.""

A second 100-foot (30-meter) breach in the levee opened closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee was a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

""We had so many years of drought and they could've fixed the levee way back and they didn't,"" said Garcia, the Pajaro evacuee. ""This is the second time it happened. Back in 1995, same thing. We lost everything.""

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Highway 1, a main link between the two counties, was closed along with several other roads.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

Damaging winds with gusts topping 70 mph (113 kph) blew out windows, and there were numerous reports of falling trees. Power outages hit more than 330,000 utility customers in northern and central areas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.

Crews raced to stabilize the Pajaro River's ruptured levee Tuesday, placing rocks and boulders to finish filling the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Workers will then raise that portion's elevation to match the rest of the levee over the next few weeks to make it impermeable, officials said.

Tuesday's storm initially spread light to moderate rain over the state's north and center. But the National Weather Service said the storm was moving faster than expected and that most of the precipitation would shift southward.

""Even a small amount of rain could potentially have larger impacts,"" Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency said Tuesday during a news conference.

Powerful winds damaged windows in a San Francisco high-rise, causing glass to rain down and forcing evacuations from the building in the financial district. No injuries were immediately reported. A gust of 74 mph (119 kph) was recorded at the city's airport, the weather service said.

So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers -- long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean -- as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off a runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages Tuesday.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders began at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.

The storm caused emergency declarations for 40 counties.

In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters by Tuesday morning, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services. Updated figures were not immediately available.

More flooding was expected on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week's atmospheric river. Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday.

The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the failure late Friday, officials said. A roughly 20-foot (6.10-meter) gap remained Tuesday afternoon.

Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops, was largely flooded. More than 8,500 people were told to evacuate, and nearly 250 people have been rescued by first responders since Friday.

Some residents of the largely Latino farmworker community stayed. One shelter was already full by midday Tuesday, and officials were forced to open two more to accommodate the evacuees.

""We live seven houses away from the river and the water level was six feet high, seven probably,"" said evacuee Andres Garcia. ""So we probably lost everything.""

A second 100-foot (30-meter) breach in the levee opened closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee was a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

""We had so many years of drought and they could've fixed the levee way back and they didn't,"" said Garcia, the Pajaro evacuee. ""This is the second time it happened. Back in 1995, same thing. We lost everything.""

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Highway 1, a main link between the two counties, was closed along with several other roads.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

Damaging winds with gusts topping 70 mph (113 kph) blew out windows, and there were numerous reports of falling trees. Power outages hit more than 330,000 utility customers in northern and central areas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.

LOS ANGELES -- The levee breach that left an entire California town underwater this weekend is putting a spotlight on how the state's vital flood control infrastructure is being weakened by age, drought, climate change, rodents and neglect - leaving scores of communities at risk.

On Friday night, the swollen Pajaro River burst through the worn-down levee, flooding the entire town of Pajaro and sending its roughly 3,000 residents into what officials are now estimating to be a multi-month-long exile. A second breach was reported on Monday.

For decades, the levee was ignored by the federal government - never rising to the status of a fix-worthy project - despite repeated pleas, breaches, floods and even two deaths.

""Yeah, the money wasn't there because the prioritization wasn't there,"" said Mark Strudley, executive director of the Pajaro Regional Flood Management Agency.

And as the communities and local government agencies begged for help and funding, the levee aged, eroded and, in some places, sank.

The situation is by no means unique to Pajaro. Experts say similar weaknesses plague levee systems across California and the nation.

As climate change threatens to intensify and exacerbate extreme weather events - such as flooding and even drought - the unease and desperation of residents and emergency responders in communities near these crumbling systems is growing.

""We all know that there's a lot of economically disadvantaged communities that are built in natural disaster-prone areas,"" Strudley said. ""That's just the very unfortunate way the planning and development process has worked over the past 100 plus years in the United States.""

Throughout Northern California, the Central Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, there are more than 13,000 miles of levees designed to protect dry land from floods, deliver drinking water, and protect homes, businesses, and agriculture from flooding.

According to work by Farhid Vahedifard - a professor of civil engineering at the University of Mississippi - a high percentage were constructed by settlers in the mid- to late 19th century to protect agricultural lands from flooding.

""And they've been worn down, just like anything else,"" Strudley said. ""They have a limited life span.""

In most cases, Strudley and Vahedifard said, the levees were built with poorly compacted, unengineered mixtures of sandy, clayey and organic soils, material ""that was scraped up out of the riverbed and used for fill to build the levees,"" Strudley said.

In addition, they've suffered the wear-and-tear of time, rodents, seismic events and drought.

""These things leak long before they get overtopped,"" said Strudley, noting that one of the biggest problems is burrowing animals.

In 2011, the California Department of Water Resources examined Northern California's levee system. The evaluation considered about 1,800 miles of earthworks throughout the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins and found that more than half of the levees were what they considered ""high hazard"" - indicating they were in danger of failing during an earthquake or flood event.

And that was before the megadrought, which dried out soils within the levees and underneath them - causing the structures to weaken and lose strength, Vahedifard said.

Drought also hastened subsidence as water districts and users siphoned water from underground aquifers, depressing and sinking the land above.

But until recently, the federal government and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not see these systems - particularly if they were in marginalized or economically disadvantaged communities - as a priority.

""The federal funding system for levees and other life protection systems completely disadvantages federally disadvantaged communities, systemically,"" said Zach Friend, a Santa Cruz County supervisor whose district encompasses Watsonville and the northern side of the Pajaro River Valley.

He said what happened to the levee in Pajaro could have been prevented had resources been provided to the community to rebuild the levee - something it had been requesting since the 1960s.

""The storms that came that blew out the levee ... are a five- to seven-year-interval storm,"" he said. ""So if our infrastructure can't even withhold what really is a relatively regular occurrence storm, climate change - what we are seeing in the future and what it's going to do to disadvantaged communities - is something beyond the pale.""

He said the cumulative effect of these storms and the ""weather whiplash"" between severe drought and severe storms ""really tests the possibility of how you even build for and plan for that level of resilience toward communities that have been under-invested in for the last 100 years and that are starting at a net negative rebuild.""

The levee failure on the Pajaro River points to larger hazards that California has yet to address in many areas where communities are vulnerable, said Deirdre Des Jardins, an independent water researcher and advocate.

""Pajaro is just the beginning,"" Des Jardins said.

Des Jardins has for years urged state and local officials to invest in flood protection infrastructure in areas that are at risk, and she has suggested an effective climate adaptation strategy should focus on ""measurable, actionable targets for protection of vulnerable populations.""

""You look at where to invest money to protect lives. And we're not doing that. We don't have quantifiable targets about protecting lives and protecting these vulnerable communities,"" De Jardins said.

In addition to rural communities like Pajaro, she said that Stockton and neighboring cities face major flood risks due to their reliance on inadequate levees with known seepage problems.

As the federal government continues to re-evaluate how it invests in major infrastructure projects in economically disadvantaged communities, the cost of doing nothing will continue to mount.

""How much flood risk is there in California? A bunch. The reason is pretty simple,"" said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. ""The economic consequences of even a modest flood are pretty high.""

He said this is especially the case in the L.A. Basin, where the growing likelihood of major flooding overlaps with the increasing value of surrounding properties.

""There is a long legacy of very bad flood management and land use choices along the L.A., San Gabriel and Santa Ana rivers,"" Mount said. ""That is an equation for high risk because eventually a flood will come and the economic costs will be immense.""

Local, state and federal officials have improved flood control infrastructure in the Sacramento area during the last two decades, which has reduced risk in the area, Mount said.

Still, many low-lying communities in the Central Valley face substantial flood risks. And many farms in and around the Delta sit below sea level, requiring levees to keep water out, Mount said.

""Our flood infrastructure is old,"" Mount said, ""and is designed for the hydrology of the past, not the future.

""This is going to be a major challenge going forward, particularly because we have increased the potential economic costs of flooding by our land use choices.""

In January, when levees failed along the Cosumnes and Mokelumne rivers and caused deadly flooding, Mount said those failures point to larger hazards. ""There are two kinds of levees: Those that have failed, and those that will fail,"" he said.

Mount said he is now especially concerned about the immense amount of snowmelt runoff expected from the central and southern Sierra this spring.",[],"[{'uri':

The wind was so strong it is suspected to have sent glass falling from a downtown San Francisco high-rise building and toppled trees and power lines across the state.

The San Francisco Bay area's public transit system, known as BART, was also being heavily impacted by the storm Tuesday. ""Most of our impacts on service have been due to high winds toppling trees and fallen branches entering our trackway,"" BART spokeswoman Cheryl Stalter tells CNN.

Top wind gusts of 74 mph were measured at San Francisco Airport, 97 mph at Santa Clara County's Loma Prieta and 93 mph at Alameda County's Mines Tower, according to the National Weather Service.

The combination of strong winds and heavy rain also left over 206,000 homes and businesses without power across California early Wednesday, many of them in Santa Clara County south of San Francisco, according to PowerOutage.US.

About 30 million people across California remain under flood alerts as the storm wallops the state with repeated rounds of heavy rain and mountain snow, with rain pummeling already saturated land, threatening more dangerous floods and mudslides.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded a state of emergency to cover 43 of the state's 58 counties Tuesday night as high winds and intense rain wrought havoc in the state.

This is the 11th atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose -- to inundate California this winter season, arriving on the heels of another storm that hit central California particularly hard.

The state will get just a few days of reprieve after this storm tapers off Wednesday before yet another atmospheric river arrives next week, the National Weather Service warns.

The back-to-back storms have forced many people out of their homes as officials worried about mudslides from fire-scarred areas, overflowing rivers and dangerous road conditions.

More than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and nearly another 27,000 were under evacuation orders across the state as of Tuesday morning, California Governor's Office of Emergency Services spokesman Gustavo Ortiz told CNN.

Statewide, hundreds of people were taking refuge in dozens of shelters across multiple counties Tuesday, according to state officials.

Evacuation alerts remain in several counties Wednesday, including for those near the swollen Salinas and Pajaro rivers in Monterey County. To the south, residents near wildfire burn scars in Los Angeles County were under evacuation warnings.

In Placer County, a mudslide Tuesday evening caused major damage to a home in Colfax, prompting an evacuation warning for other homes, according to the CAL FIRE Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit.

The heaviest rain is continuing to shift southward and will impact areas from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles and San Diego through early Wednesday morning.

Floodwater invades homes

Many of those who've had to leave their homes are from Monterey County, where crews are racing to repair a breach in a river levee that sent water rushing into a nearby community of Pajaro overnight Friday.

More than 2,000 people have also been evacuated from the Pajaro area, Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said.

Water from another breach in the area eroded nearby bridges and flowed into Highway 1 -- a major highway that had to be shuttered, Monterey County officials said.

Video from Pajaro shows the community still looking like a lake, with floodwater reaching all the way to cars' doorhandles. More than 239 people have been rescued in the Pajaro area, with crews using high-water vehicles and boats to pull people from floodwater, Nieto said.

One Pajaro resident drove to the outskirts of town to see her home for the first time since evacuating Saturday morning. She found the bottom level of her home and the garage under water, she told CNN affiliate KSBW.

""I want to cry but what's crying going to do? It's just sad, so sad,"" Michelle Keith told KSBW.

Another Pajaro resident, Ruth Ruiz, hasn't been able to return home since she left in hurry before dawn Saturday and was worried about how long it'll take to get back to normal life after evacuation orders are lifted.

""We don't really have a plan. We're just taking it day by day. But we have a feeling it's going to be months before even insurance can cover any damages,"" Ruiz told CNN affiliate KPIX.

Crews were making progress filling the gaps in the levee Tuesday, racing to stem the flow of water from the breach.

""We caught a little bit of a break, the modeling changed from last night to this morning as we talked about,"" Sheriff Nieto said. ""Some of the precipitation we thought was going to be dumped into Monterey County has shifted south of us towards Paso Robles and into the Santa Barbara area.""

Another atmospheric river expected

California has been hit with an unrelenting barrage of atmospheric rivers that brought deadly flooding to the state this winter season, and this latest one won't be the last.

Once this storm system moves out Wednesday, the state will get a few days of relief before another atmospheric river arrives, the National Weather Service said.

Heavy rain, melting snowpack, saturated soils and swollen streams may lead to prolonged flooding concerns and the potential for shallow landslides in some areas of California,"" the Weather Service said.

More rain, snow, high winds and flooding could be on the forecast for much of California from March 21 to March 23, forecasters said.

Atmospheric rivers are typically 250 to 375 miles wide and can stretch more than a thousand miles long, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.

While they're an important source of rainfall for the West, atmospheric rivers can create conditions similar to those of hurricanes when they pass over land, according to NOAA.

Due to the effects of global warming, scientists believe atmospheric rivers can become more intense as the air temperatures increase.

Atmospheric rivers will be ""significantly longer and wider than the ones we observe today, leading to more frequent atmospheric river conditions in affected areas,"" a NASA-led study found.

The wind was so strong it is suspected to have sent glass falling from a downtown San Francisco high-rise building and toppled trees and power lines across the state.

The San Francisco Bay area's public transit system, known as BART, was also being heavily impacted by the storm Tuesday. ""Most of our impacts on service have been due to high winds toppling trees and fallen branches entering our trackway,"" BART spokeswoman Cheryl Stalter tells CNN.

Top wind gusts of 74 mph were measured at San Francisco Airport, 97 mph at Santa Clara County's Loma Prieta and 93 mph at Alameda County's Mines Tower, according to the National Weather Service.

The combination of strong winds and heavy rain also left over 206,000 homes and businesses without power across California early Wednesday, many of them in Santa Clara County south of San Francisco, according to PowerOutage.US.

About 30 million people across California remain under flood alerts as the storm wallops the state with repeated rounds of heavy rain and mountain snow, with rain pummeling already saturated land, threatening more dangerous floods and mudslides.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded a state of emergency to cover 43 of the state's 58 counties Tuesday night as high winds and intense rain wrought havoc in the state.

This is the 11th atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose -- to inundate California this winter season, arriving on the heels of another storm that hit central California particularly hard.

The state will get just a few days of reprieve after this storm tapers off Wednesday before yet another atmospheric river arrives next week, the National Weather Service warns.

The back-to-back storms have forced many people out of their homes as officials worried about mudslides from fire-scarred areas, overflowing rivers and dangerous road conditions.

More than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and nearly another 27,000 were under evacuation orders across the state as of Tuesday morning, California Governor's Office of Emergency Services spokesman Gustavo Ortiz told CNN.

Statewide, hundreds of people were taking refuge in dozens of shelters across multiple counties Tuesday, according to state officials.

Evacuation alerts remain in several counties Wednesday, including for those near the swollen Salinas and Pajaro rivers in Monterey County. To the south, residents near wildfire burn scars in Los Angeles County were under evacuation warnings.

In Placer County, a mudslide Tuesday evening caused major damage to a home in Colfax, prompting an evacuation warning for other homes, according to the CAL FIRE Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit.

The heaviest rain is continuing to shift southward and will impact areas from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles and San Diego through early Wednesday morning.

Floodwater invades homes

Many of those who've had to leave their homes are from Monterey County, where crews are racing to repair a breach in a river levee that sent water rushing into a nearby community of Pajaro overnight Friday.

More than 2,000 people have also been evacuated from the Pajaro area, Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said.

Water from another breach in the area eroded nearby bridges and flowed into Highway 1 -- a major highway that had to be shuttered, Monterey County officials said.

Video from Pajaro shows the community still looking like a lake, with floodwater reaching all the way to cars' doorhandles. More than 239 people have been rescued in the Pajaro area, with crews using high-water vehicles and boats to pull people from floodwater, Nieto said.

One Pajaro resident drove to the outskirts of town to see her home for the first time since evacuating Saturday morning. She found the bottom level of her home and the garage under water, she told CNN affiliate KSBW.

""I want to cry but what's crying going to do? It's just sad, so sad,"" Michelle Keith told KSBW.

Another Pajaro resident, Ruth Ruiz, hasn't been able to return home since she left in hurry before dawn Saturday and was worried about how long it'll take to get back to normal life after evacuation orders are lifted.

""We don't really have a plan. We're just taking it day by day. But we have a feeling it's going to be months before even insurance can cover any damages,"" Ruiz told CNN affiliate KPIX.

Crews were making progress filling the gaps in the levee Tuesday, racing to stem the flow of water from the breach.

""We caught a little bit of a break, the modeling changed from last night to this morning as we talked about,"" Sheriff Nieto said. ""Some of the precipitation we thought was going to be dumped into Monterey County has shifted south of us towards Paso Robles and into the Santa Barbara area.""

Another atmospheric river expected

California has been hit with an unrelenting barrage of atmospheric rivers that brought deadly flooding to the state this winter season, and this latest one won't be the last.

Once this storm system moves out Wednesday, the state will get a few days of relief before another atmospheric river arrives, the National Weather Service said.

Heavy rain, melting snowpack, saturated soils and swollen streams may lead to prolonged flooding concerns and the potential for shallow landslides in some areas of California,"" the Weather Service said.

More rain, snow, high winds and flooding could be on the forecast for much of California from March 21 to March 23, forecasters said.

Atmospheric rivers are typically 250 to 375 miles wide and can stretch more than a thousand miles long, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.

While they're an important source of rainfall for the West, atmospheric rivers can create conditions similar to those of hurricanes when they pass over land, according to NOAA.

Due to the effects of global warming, scientists believe atmospheric rivers can become more intense as the air temperatures increase.

Atmospheric rivers will be ""significantly longer and wider than the ones we observe today, leading to more frequent atmospheric river conditions in affected areas,"" a NASA-led study found.

Hundreds of residents were forced to leave their homes. A second levee breach was reported Monday. Work is underway to plug the gaps as another storm system bears down on the region -- and even more rain is expected next week.

The river is the dividing line between Santa Cruz County to the north and Monterey County to the south, and the town of Pajaro sits on the southern side of the river.

The vast majority of Pajaro's residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, according to the most recent U.S. Census data, which also shows nearly a fifth of people there live in poverty.

As my colleagues Susanne Rust and Ian James reported this week, the devastation in Pajaro was not some unavoidable act of nature, but the result of what happens when aging, inadequate flood controls are neglected and unfixed.

""For decades, the levee was ignored by the federal government -- never rising to the status of a fix-worthy project -- despite repeated pleas, breaches, floods and even two deaths,"" they wrote.

Those deaths occurred in 1995 in a flood that caused an estimated $95 million in damage to the community.

""We feel abandoned sometimes,"" Pajaro resident Karla Loreto told Times reporters this week. ""Ever since I moved here, I've always heard about the 1995 flooding and this view that this part of town is so bad and extremely poor.""

Monterey County Supervisor Luis Alejo has called on the state to provide aid for Pajaro's undocumented residents, many of them farmworkers, saying they won't qualify for federal aid.

""These are our friends, our neighbors, these are people that we really care about, and we know that they're going to go through some tremendous hardship over the next several months,"" he told The Times.

Water management experts told Rust and James that ""similar weaknesses"" are impacting levees across the Golden State and elsewhere in the U.S.

A 2011 state study of Northern California's levee system listed more than half of the levees as ""high hazard"" -- meaning they were at elevated risk of failing due to floods or earthquakes. In the years since that study, California's megadrought has further weakened levees by drying out the soil around them, an engineering expert told the reporters.

""As climate change threatens to intensify and exacerbate extreme weather events -- such as flooding and even drought -- the unease and desperation of residents and emergency responders in communities near these crumbling systems is growing,"" they wrote.

And the risks extend to Southern California, one policy expert explained.

Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, pointed to ""a long legacy of very bad flood management and land use choices"" throughout the L.A. Basin, where the chance of major flooding is increasing.

""That is an equation for high risk because eventually a flood will come and the economic costs will be immense,"" he told The Times.

An independent water researcher and advocate said that what happened to Pajaro's residents indicates a system of neglect in how government prioritizes its more vulnerable communities.

""You look at where to invest money to protect lives,"" she told Rust and Jame. ""And we're not doing that.""

By Nouran Salahieh and Joe Sutton, CNN

Hundreds of thousands in flood-ravaged California are without power and hundreds of people are in shelters as the latest atmospheric river sweeps though the state with ferocious hurricane-force winds and drenches already flooded neighborhoods.

The wind was so strong it is suspected to have sent glass falling from a downtown San Francisco high-rise building and toppled trees and power lines across the state.

The San Francisco Bay area's public transit system, known as BART, was also being heavily impacted by the storm Tuesday. ""Most of our impacts on service have been due to high winds toppling trees and fallen branches entering our trackway,"" BART spokeswoman Cheryl Stalter tells CNN.

Top wind gusts of 74 mph were measured at San Francisco Airport, 97 mph at Santa Clara County's Loma Prieta and 93 mph at Alameda County's Mines Tower, according to the National Weather Service.

The combination of strong winds and heavy rain also left over 206,000 homes and businesses without power across California early Wednesday, many of them in Santa Clara County south of San Francisco, according to PowerOutage.US.

About 30 million people across California remain under flood alerts as the storm wallops the state with repeated rounds of heavy rain and mountain snow, with rain pummeling already saturated land, threatening more dangerous floods and mudslides.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded a state of emergency to cover 43 of the state's 58 counties Tuesday night as high winds and intense rain wrought havoc in the state.

This is the 11th atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose -- to inundate California this winter season, arriving on the heels of another storm that hit central California particularly hard.

The state will get just a few days of reprieve after this storm tapers off Wednesday before yet another atmospheric river arrives next week, the National Weather Service warns.

The back-to-back storms have forced many people out of their homes as officials worried about mudslides from fire-scarred areas, overflowing rivers and dangerous road conditions.

More than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and nearly another 27,000 were under evacuation orders across the state as of Tuesday morning, California Governor's Office of Emergency Services spokesman Gustavo Ortiz told CNN.

Statewide, hundreds of people were taking refuge in dozens of shelters across multiple counties Tuesday, according to state officials.

Evacuation alerts remain in several counties Wednesday, including for those near the swollen Salinas and Pajaro rivers in Monterey County. To the south, residents near wildfire burn scars in Los Angeles County were under evacuation warnings.

In Placer County, a mudslide Tuesday evening caused major damage to a home in Colfax, prompting an evacuation warning for other homes, according to the CAL FIRE Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit.

The heaviest rain is continuing to shift southward and will impact areas from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles and San Diego through early Wednesday morning.

Floodwater invades homes

Many of those who've had to leave their homes are from Monterey County, where crews are racing to repair a breach in a river levee that sent water rushing into a nearby community of Pajaro overnight Friday.

More than 2,000 people have also been evacuated from the Pajaro area, Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said.

Water from another breach in the area eroded nearby bridges and flowed into Highway 1 -- a major highway that had to be shuttered, Monterey County officials said.

Video from Pajaro shows the community still looking like a lake, with floodwater reaching all the way to cars' doorhandles. More than 239 people have been rescued in the Pajaro area, with crews using high-water vehicles and boats to pull people from floodwater, Nieto said.

One Pajaro resident drove to the outskirts of town to see her home for the first time since evacuating Saturday morning. She found the bottom level of her home and the garage under water, she told CNN affiliate KSBW.

""I want to cry but what's crying going to do? It's just sad, so sad,"" Michelle Keith told KSBW.

Another Pajaro resident, Ruth Ruiz, hasn't been able to return home since she left in hurry before dawn Saturday and was worried about how long it'll take to get back to normal life after evacuation orders are lifted.

""We don't really have a plan. We're just taking it day by day. But we have a feeling it's going to be months before even insurance can cover any damages,"" Ruiz told CNN affiliate KPIX.

Crews were making progress filling the gaps in the levee Tuesday, racing to stem the flow of water from the breach.

""We caught a little bit of a break, the modeling changed from last night to this morning as we talked about,"" Sheriff Nieto said. ""Some of the precipitation we thought was going to be dumped into Monterey County has shifted south of us towards Paso Robles and into the Santa Barbara area.""

Another atmospheric river expected

California has been hit with an unrelenting barrage of atmospheric rivers that brought deadly flooding to the state this winter season, and this latest one won't be the last.

Once this storm system moves out Wednesday, the state will get a few days of relief before another atmospheric river arrives, the National Weather Service said.

Heavy rain, melting snowpack, saturated soils and swollen streams may lead to prolonged flooding concerns and the potential for shallow landslides in some areas of California,"" the Weather Service said.

More rain, snow, high winds and flooding could be on the forecast for much of California from March 21 to March 23, forecasters said.

Atmospheric rivers are typically 250 to 375 miles wide and can stretch more than a thousand miles long, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.

While they're an important source of rainfall for the West, atmospheric rivers can create conditions similar to those of hurricanes when they pass over land, according to NOAA.

Due to the effects of global warming, scientists believe atmospheric rivers can become more intense as the air temperatures increase.

Atmospheric rivers will be ""significantly longer and wider than the ones we observe today, leading to more frequent atmospheric river conditions in affected areas,"" a NASA-led study found.

By HAVEN DALEY and JOHN ANTCZAK - Associated Press

WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.

Damaging winds with gusts topping 70 mph (113 kph) blew out windows, and there were numerous reports of falling trees. Power outages hit more than 330,000 utility customers in northern and central areas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.

Crews raced to stabilize the Pajaro River's ruptured levee Tuesday, placing rocks and boulders to finish filling the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Workers will then raise that portion's elevation to match the rest of the levee over the next few weeks to make it impermeable, officials said.

Tuesday's storm initially spread light to moderate rain over the state's north and center. But the National Weather Service said the storm was moving faster than expected and that most of the precipitation would shift southward.

""Even a small amount of rain could potentially have larger impacts,"" Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency said Tuesday during a news conference.

Powerful winds damaged windows in a San Francisco high-rise, causing glass to rain down and forcing evacuations from the building in the financial district. No injuries were immediately reported. A gust of 74 mph (119 kph) was recorded at the city's airport, the weather service said.

So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers -- long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean -- as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off a runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages Tuesday.

Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders began at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.

The storm caused emergency declarations for 40 counties.

In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters by Tuesday morning, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services. Updated figures were not immediately available.

More flooding was expected on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week's atmospheric river. Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday.

The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the failure late Friday, officials said. A roughly 20-foot (6.10-meter) gap remained Tuesday afternoon.

Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops, was largely flooded. More than 8,500 people were told to evacuate, and nearly 250 people have been rescued by first responders since Friday.

Some residents of the largely Latino farmworker community stayed. One shelter was already full by midday Tuesday, and officials were forced to open two more to accommodate the evacuees.

""We live seven houses away from the river and the water level was six feet high, seven probably,"" said evacuee Andres Garcia. ""So we probably lost everything.""

A second 100-foot (30-meter) breach in the levee opened closer to the Pacific coast, providing a ""relief valve"" for floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.

Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee was a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.

""We had so many years of drought and they could've fixed the levee way back and they didn't,"" said Garcia, the Pajaro evacuee. ""This is the second time it happened. Back in 1995, same thing. We lost everything.""

The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Highway 1, a main link between the two counties, was closed along with several other roads.

By Nouran Salahieh and Joe Sutton, CNN

Hundreds of thousands in flood-ravaged California are without power and hundreds of people are in shelters as the latest atmospheric river sweeps though the state with ferocious hurricane-force winds and drenches already flooded neighborhoods.

The wind was so strong it is suspected to have sent glass falling from a downtown San Francisco high-rise building and toppled trees and power lines across the state.

The San Francisco Bay area's public transit system, known as BART, was also being heavily impacted by the storm Tuesday. ""Most of our impacts on service have been due to high winds toppling trees and fallen branches entering our trackway,"" BART spokeswoman Cheryl Stalter tells CNN.

Top wind gusts of 74 mph were measured at San Francisco Airport, 97 mph at Santa Clara County's Loma Prieta and 93 mph at Alameda County's Mines Tower, according to the National Weather Service.

The combination of strong winds and heavy rain also left over 206,000 homes and businesses without power across California early Wednesday, many of them in Santa Clara County south of San Francisco, according to PowerOutage.US.

About 30 million people across California remain under flood alerts as the storm wallops the state with repeated rounds of heavy rain and mountain snow, with rain pummeling already saturated land, threatening more dangerous floods and mudslides.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded a state of emergency to cover 43 of the state's 58 counties Tuesday night as high winds and intense rain wrought havoc in the state.

This is the 11th atmospheric river -- a long, narrow band of moisture that can carry saturated air thousands of miles like a fire hose -- to inundate California this winter season, arriving on the heels of another storm that hit central California particularly hard.

The state will get just a few days of reprieve after this storm tapers off Wednesday before yet another atmospheric river arrives next week, the National Weather Service warns.

The back-to-back storms have forced many people out of their homes as officials worried about mudslides from fire-scarred areas, overflowing rivers and dangerous road conditions.

More than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and nearly another 27,000 were under evacuation orders across the state as of Tuesday morning, California Governor's Office of Emergency Services spokesman Gustavo Ortiz told CNN.

Statewide, hundreds of people were taking refuge in dozens of shelters across multiple counties Tuesday, according to state officials.

Evacuation alerts remain in several counties Wednesday, including for those near the swollen Salinas and Pajaro rivers in Monterey County. To the south, residents near wildfire burn scars in Los Angeles County were under evacuation warnings.

In Placer County, a mudslide Tuesday evening caused major damage to a home in Colfax, prompting an evacuation warning for other homes, according to the CAL FIRE Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit.

The heaviest rain is continuing to shift southward and will impact areas from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles and San Diego through early Wednesday morning.

Floodwater invades homes

Many of those who've had to leave their homes are from Monterey County, where crews are racing to repair a breach in a river levee that sent water rushing into a nearby community of Pajaro overnight Friday.

More than 2,000 people have also been evacuated from the Pajaro area, Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said.

Water from another breach in the area eroded nearby bridges and flowed into Highway 1 -- a major highway that had to be shuttered, Monterey County officials said.

Video from Pajaro shows the community still looking like a lake, with floodwater reaching all the way to cars' doorhandles. More than 239 people have been rescued in the Pajaro area, with crews using high-water vehicles and boats to pull people from floodwater, Nieto said.

One Pajaro resident drove to the outskirts of town to see her home for the first time since evacuating Saturday morning. She found the bottom level of her home and the garage under water, she told CNN affiliate KSBW.

""I want to cry but what's crying going to do? It's just sad, so sad,"" Michelle Keith told KSBW.

Another Pajaro resident, Ruth Ruiz, hasn't been able to return home since she left in hurry before dawn Saturday and was worried about how long it'll take to get back to normal life after evacuation orders are lifted.

""We don't really have a plan. We're just taking it day by day. But we have a feeling it's going to be months before even insurance can cover any damages,"" Ruiz told CNN affiliate KPIX.

Crews were making progress filling the gaps in the levee Tuesday, racing to stem the flow of water from the breach.

""We caught a little bit of a break, the modeling changed from last night to this morning as we talked about,"" Sheriff Nieto said. ""Some of the precipitation we thought was going to be dumped into Monterey County has shifted south of us towards Paso Robles and into the Santa Barbara area.""

Another atmospheric river expected

California has been hit with an unrelenting barrage of atmospheric rivers that brought deadly flooding to the state this winter season, and this latest one won't be the last.

Once this storm system moves out Wednesday, the state will get a few days of relief before another atmospheric river arrives, the National Weather Service said.

Heavy rain, melting snowpack, saturated soils and swollen streams may lead to prolonged flooding concerns and the potential for shallow landslides in some areas of California,"" the Weather Service said.

More rain, snow, high winds and flooding could be on the forecast for much of California from March 21 to March 23, forecasters said.

Atmospheric rivers are typically 250 to 375 miles wide and can stretch more than a thousand miles long, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.

While they're an important source of rainfall for the West, atmospheric rivers can create conditions similar to those of hurricanes when they pass over land, according to NOAA.

Due to the effects of global warming, scientists believe atmospheric rivers can become more intense as the air temperatures increase.

Atmospheric rivers will be ""significantly longer and wider than the ones we observe today, leading to more frequent atmospheric river conditions in affected areas,"" a NASA-led study found.

The wind was so strong it is suspected to have sent glass falling from a downtown San Francisco high-rise building and toppled trees and power lines across the state.

The San Francisco Bay area's public transit system, known as BART, was also being heavily impacted by the storm Tuesday. ""Most of our impacts on service have been due to high winds toppling trees and fallen branches entering our trackway,"" BART spokeswoman Cheryl Stalter tells CNN.

Top wind gusts of 74 mph were measured at San Francisco Airport, 97 mph at Santa Clara County's Loma Prieta and 93 mph at Alameda County's Mines Tower, according to the National Weather Service.

The combination of strong winds and heavy rain also left over 206,000 homes and businesses without power across California early Wednesday, many of them in Santa Clara County south of San Francisco, according to PowerOutage.US.

About 30 million people across California remain under flood alerts as the storm wallops the state with repeated rounds of heavy rain and mountain snow, with rain pummeling already saturated land, threatening more dangerous floods and mudslides.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded a state of emergency to cover 43 of the state's 58 counties Tuesday night as high winds and intense rain wrought havoc in the state.

But in the latest example of how California's vast and aging infrastructure is being tested by this year's onslaught of extreme winter weather, the crews could not keep up.

As they backed away, the river burst with a mighty roar through the worn-down levee, flooding freeways and farms, submerging the entire town of Pajaro and forcing thousands of residents in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties to flee.

""I have to start from zero,"" Antonio Arroyo, a 58-year-old farmworker, said Tuesday as he sat in an evacuation center at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds with about 300 displaced residents from the same community, known for harvesting strawberries. He had been sleeping in a Honda minivan when firefighters rescued him from the rising floodwaters in Pajaro; the donated red sneakers, bluejeans, sweater and plaid shirt he was wearing were ""all I have,"" he said.

As a fresh atmospheric river ravaged California on Tuesday, triggering flood watches and warnings from Southern California to the Oregon border, water experts warned that the recent storms could be just a prelude to an even more challenging spring.

Already, the landscape is beyond saturated after a winter that has set or approached records for precipitation. By Tuesday afternoon, heavy rain reached the Los Angeles Basin, where officials warned residents to avoid driving through flooded roadways and fire authorities said they rescued eight people and eight dogs from the San Gabriel River in Azusa late Monday.

In the Bay Area and Central Coast, strong winds downed power lines and tall trees. More than 350,000 utility customers were without power at one point Tuesday, most of them customers of Pacific Gas and Electric in hard-hit Northern California, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks blackouts. Gusts of up to 74 mph were recorded at San Francisco International Airport, where operations were paused briefly after the FAA issued a ground stop.

More than 1,500 dams and some 14,000 miles of levees help control California's waterways, according to federal statistics. And this year's storms are capping the driest three years on record, noted Gary Lippner, deputy director of dam safety and flood management with the state's Department of Water Resources.

""California,"" he said, ""has experienced true climate whiplash this year.""

Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow specializing in water at the Public Policy Institute of California, a research organization, said the cumulative effect of this winter's back-to-back storms had left California in ""uncharted territory,"" particularly in the southern Sierra Nevada, where the water content of the snowpack was the largest recorded.

As the snowpack melts, he said, and dam managers are forced to release water from fast-filling reservoirs to make room for incoming rain, flood-prone communities could become overwhelmed.

""It is worth remembering that almost all of our flood management infrastructure is more than a half-century old and designed around the climate of the past,"" Mount said Tuesday in an email.

""While we have had many discussions about adapting to droughts of the future -- and are making progress -- we are still in the most nascent stages of thinking about how to adapt to larger floods.""

Statewide, the winter storms have stressed the state's infrastructure since January, particularly in low-lying, inland areas crisscrossed by rivers. Along the Cosumnes River near Sacramento, where more than a dozen levee breaches flooded roads and inundated homes during storms around New Year's Day, communities are still recovering.

To the north of the state Capitol, the authorities who maintain the watershed that encompasses the Sacramento International Airport said that when one of their pumps exploded this year during a powerful storm system, they discovered that their equipment was so old that the manufacturer no longer carried the parts they needed to fix it.

""We managed to get it back online with a $600 part we found on eBay,"" said Kevin L. King, the general manager of Reclamation District No. 1000, an agency formed to maintain levees and protect acreage from flooding. ""We were within 12 to 24 hours of telling the airport to reroute flights because there would have been water flooding the runways.""

Strudley said that federal, state and local officials had talked since the 1960s about the need to shore up the water infrastructure around the Pajaro River, but the property values in the area were so low that they did not meet the threshold for repair under the cost-benefit formula that the federal government and the Army Corps of Engineers were using.

That approach, which systemically disadvantaged poorer communities, has begun to change, he said. A major project to upgrade and strengthen the local levees at an estimated cost of more than $500 million was underway when the storm hit, and the flood has prompted local officials to begin talks with the federal government about expediting its planned 2025 groundbreaking, Strudley said.

Even so, he added, the project is expected to take eight to 10 years.

In Watsonville, across the river from their community of Pajaro, displaced farmworkers said it was unclear how long they could hold out with both their homes and the fields they depend on for paychecks underwater. Some said they had been living in their cars for days, not knowing where to go.

The working-class agricultural region is tucked between the beaches of Santa Cruz that are popular with surfers, and the wealthy Monterey Peninsula known for its world-class Pebble Beach Golf Links. Often cloaked in fog near the coastline of the Pacific Ocean, workers in the Pajaro Valley pick strawberries and harvest lettuce and artichokes savored by the rest of the nation.

Marina Hernandez, 31, said she received a knock on the door just after midnight Saturday from a county worker saying her family had an hour to evacuate. She called her husband, who was working an overnight shift about 20 miles away at a garlic packing plant in Gilroy, and then quickly collected important documents, like birth certificates and Social Security cards.

But she said county officials did not tell her where to find shelter, so she and her family were living for a few days in their pickup truck. ""All they said was: 'Get out! Get out!' But they didn't tell us where to go. Nothing.""

Finally, after being sent away from the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds because the evacuation center was over capacity, she found her way Tuesday afternoon to a small shelter set up in the gymnasium of a veterans hall in Watsonville.

Sitting on a cot with her 14-month-old daughter as her 5-year-old son lay playing with his phone on another cot, Hernandez said she was sad and frustrated and had no idea the condition of her home.

Weeks might pass, she said, before she and her family could go back. Until then, she said, ""I'm not able to do anything.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajaro_River', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pajaro River'}}, {'uri':
