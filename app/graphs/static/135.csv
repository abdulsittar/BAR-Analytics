U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his policy for Afghanistan on Monday, committing to an open-ended conflict there and singling out Pakistan for harbouring Afghan Taliban insurgents and other militants.

U.S. officials later warned that aid to Pakistan might be cut and Washington might downgrade nuclear-armed Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO ally to pressure it to do more to help bring about an end to America's longest-running war.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif added his voice to a chorus of indignation in Pakistan over the U.S. criticism, reiterating Pakistan's denial that it harbours militants.

""They should not make Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures in Afghanistan,"" Asif said in an interview to Geo TV late on Tuesday.

""Our commitment to war against terrorism is unmatched and unshaken.""

Pakistan has for years been battling militants who are seeking to overthrow the state with bomb attacks and assassinations.

But critics say the Pakistani military nurtures other Islamist factions, including the Afghan Taliban, which are seen as useful to Pakistan's core confrontation with old rival India.

Asif said Pakistan had suffered great losses from militancy - the government estimates 70,000 people have been killed since Pakistan joined the U.S. ""war on terrorism"" after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

But he said Pakistan's efforts to fight terrorism were being taken for granted and dismissed the notion the United States could ""win war against terror by threatening us or cornering us"".

""Our contributions, sacrifices and our role as a coalition country have been disregarded and disrespected,"" Asif said.

The relationship between Pakistan and the United States has endured periods of extreme strain during the past decade, especially after al Qaeda militant leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. special forces in Pakistan in 2011.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is due to meet Asif in coming days, on Tuesday outlined a range of options to change Pakistan's approach but conceded there were concerns about putting too much pressure on Pakistan.

Asif said Pakistan was also angered by Trump's appeal to India to do more in Afghanistan.

""Attempting to isolate Pakistan will not yield anything but a dangerous sharpening of strategic fault lines,"" said Sherry Rehman, a senior opposition politician and former Pakistani ambassador to the United States.

Former cricket star turned opposition politician Imran Khan said Pakistan should finally learn a valuable lesson: ""Never to fight others wars for the lure of dollars,"" he said on Twitter.

An official from Trump administration, who dismissed all concerns about India's development activities in Afghanistan, said that Pakistan was using a perceived threat of isolation by India as an 'excuse' to continue its support to terrorists.

National Security Council (NSC) spokesperson Michael Anton said that what India has been doing in Afghanistan was not a threat to Pakistan. He further added that India was not building military bases or deploying troops in Pakistan that it should feel threatened.

He went on to say that the Pakistan government had been guilty of ""active direct support"" for terrorism.

Pakistan was using this as an ""excuse"" to continue supporting terrorist groups in their country, Politico quoted Anton as saying.

Meanwhile, Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar - India's most-wanted terrorist is still in Pakistan. The list of people facing financial sanctions released by the UK mentioned the addresses associated with him. It clearly proves Pakistan's continuous stand that Dawood does not stay in their country, despite repeated assertions by India in numerous dossiers that he has a residence in Karachi.

Anton's comments came soon after US President Donald Trump had laid out his policy for Afghanistan and the South Asian region. While seeking involvement from India, Trump criticised Pakistan for supporting terrorist activities.

In reaction to Trump's announcement, the Pakistan foreign office reacted saying that the threat to peace and security ""cannot be isolated from the complex interplay of geopolitics, continued existence of festering disputes and pursuit of hegemonic policies"", according to a PTI report.

Further, the Pakistani office, in its statement, blamed Jammu and Kashmir dispute as a primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region and asked the US to join hands with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism instead of relying on ""the false narrative of safe havens.""

U.S. officials and analysts have long said Pakistan tolerates the presence of the Afghan Taliban and the allied Haqqani network, which are leading the insurgency against Afghan and U.S. forces.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Javed_Bajwa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Qamar Javed Bajwa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Associated Press'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hale_(diplomat)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'David Hale (diplomat)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Ambassador to Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}]",,eng-3382459,-0.1529411764705882,241192440,1,hosted.ap.org,news,Associated Press,Pakistan Army Afghanistan Qamar Javed Bajwa Associated Press David Hale (diplomat) United States Ambassador to Pakistan Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan) Pakistan Armed Forces Donald Trump Islamabad Pakistan Taliban,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,23,54,13,2017-08-23

Many hawks will (rightly) approve this approach.

According to Dan Markey, there were more al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan on Sept. 11 than anywhere else in the world. Pakistan has been and remains active in aiding and abetting terrorism throughout the region. However, we face three challenges when it comes to compelling Pakistan to give up its support of Salafist-Jihadist terrorist organizations: the security trilemma with China, Pakistan's nuclear bomb, and Pakistan's domestic politics.

Security trilemma with China

Many of us remember the security dilemma from our introductory political science courses. Moves designed to make one state safe make others insecure. The security trilemma suggests that moves that one state takes to help secure a second state will make a third party insecure.

The most notable example of this is America's deployment of THAAD defenses to South Korea. Despite being purely defensive in nature, this has contributed to China's sense of insecurity. A more aggressive approach toward Pakistan will exacerbate the security trilemma between the U.S., China, and Pakistan.

China and Pakistan have a long-running alliance. Pakistan was instrumental to the Nixon administration in its successful attempt to reopen China. Pakistan is similarly instrumental to China in its attempt to implement the ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative, starting with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). China has pledged $48 billion for this project.

China made it very clear that it was willing to crack the whip when it came to the protection of its citizens working in Pakistan. Neither the U.S. or China have an interest in seeing Islamic fundamentalists continue to operate from various pockets within Pakistan. Furthermore, China has undertaken investments in Afghanistan in order to harvest its mineral wealth.

The Trump administration has taken a hawkish position toward China on trade, and has been inconsistent in its attitude toward Beijing on security matters. However, there are ways to prevent a spiral of unnecessary tensions from breaking out as a result of taking a harder line toward Islamabad. Given our shared interests with China, it makes sense to bring China into the fold when it comes to pressing Pakistan over its support for, or toleration of, terrorists operating from its territory.

Pakistan's perceived need for strategic depth in Afghanistan

Pakistan supports terrorist organizations because of a perceived need for additional strategic depth against its longstanding rival, India. After it lost the 1971 war over Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan), there were real fears the rest of West Pakistan would Balkanize. Strategic depth is seen as necessary for Pakistan because of the conventional superiority of India. Some political scientists, namely the late Kenneth Waltz, say the possession of nuclear weapons should eliminate states' need for additional territory because the bomb guarantees their continued survival.

This has not proven to be the case with Pakistan. Instead, the bomb has become both a sword and a shield, encouraging the Pakistani military to double-down on its revisionist goals vis-a-vis India.

Domestic Political Pressure in Pakistan

Pakistan is often seen as a ""mixed regime,"" one that combines elements of illiberal democracy with military dictatorship. Civilian and military leaders do not rule alone but, rather, with kaleidoscopic coalitions that include a variety of factions and dueling interests. Leaders who back down in the face of international pressure not only risk being thrown out of office, but imprisonment and/or exile. This provides the current Pakistani leadership (in flux, as usual) with potent incentives to stand firm in the face of American demands to change their behavior.

C. Christine Fair points out that the Pakistani military is also believed to operate according to an aggressive strategic culture that emphasizes offense over defense. In addition to political incentives to resist compellence from the U.S., the mindset of the military itself stands in the way of cutting an anti-terrorism deal.

The Trump administration was right to call out Pakistan for egregious behavior and its shameless disregard for international norms against supporting terrorism. However, compelling Pakistan will be particularly challenging given three factors: the security trilemma, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, and its pernicious domestic political scene.

Despite the President's statement that ""we will win,"" I don't think this describes the goal of the President's Af-Pak policy. Rather, I think David Ignatius' op-ed on Trump's policy on Afghanistan gets it right. At a minimum, the President's new policy, whatever its eventual contours, is about ensuring that Afghanistan is not lost on his watch, meaning over the next 3 or so years. It is also designed to ensure that the Taliban cannot host Al-Qaeda or ISIS training camps.

The President claimed he was moving from a time-based approach to one focused on conditions. The idea is that the Taliban (and Pakistan) will not wait out the United States if they know that our commitment has no certain end date. I don't think this new approach will matter one bit. The Taliban (and their Pakistani patrons) aren't going to lose heart because this President makes a ""conditions"" based commitment of troops. The Taliban has been fighting for decades, even before 9-11. They aren't going to cry ""uncle"" because the President made an open-ended commitment.

The next ""new"" element was to condemn Pakistan for sheltering terrorists who kill American soldiers and to call upon Pakistan to ""change [that policy] immediately."" This has caused Pakistan to complain of a ""false narrative."" But this is propaganda. The President is merely saying what everyone familiar with Af-Pak policy knows: Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism. The question is what stands behind the President's exhortation?

Perhaps messages are being delivered to the Pakistan military and the Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistan military intelligence unit that funds terrorists. Undoubtedly these messages will convey something like ""We really mean it!"" But such talk is cheap. What are we actually going to do when Pakistani proxies and allies continue to kill American soldiers or launch terrorist attacks in Afghanistan? As Zalmay Khalilzad has indicated, Pakistan will ""test"" the President's mettle and attempt to show that Pakistan holds all the cards. Will he launch numerous attacks on Pakistani based terrorists without Pakistani approval?

The final element is lifting restrictions on how the war is fought. The President said that ""[m]icromanagement from Washington"" is over. I've read suggestions that this policy has proven a success in the fight against ISIS. Maybe so. But the Taliban can always slink back over the Af-Pak border and wait out this President.

I'd like to become ""sick and tired of winning"" in Afghanistan. But I can't help but being a little pessimistic.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ignatius', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'David Ignatius'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Op-ed'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmay_Khalilzad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Zalmay Khalilzad'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Inter-Services Intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Proxy war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Military intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Propaganda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}]",https://img.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517,eng-3382459,0.3019607843137255,241198860,1,washingtonpost.com,news,Washington Post,"Taliban Pakistan Terrorism Afghanistan Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant David Ignatius Pakistan Armed Forces Op-ed Al-Qaeda Zalmay Khalilzad Inter-Services Intelligence Proxy war Military intelligence Propaganda Washington, D.C.",United-States,USA,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,23,41,15,2017-08-23

It is the rhetorical equivalent of giving someone a crisp smack on the face, sharpening the impact by leaving no gaps between your fingers. My many Twitter followers from India will recognize President Trump's blunt remarks about Pakistan on Monday, made during his address unveiling the new U.S. policy on Afghanistan and South Asia, as a textbook ""tight slap.""

The President announced that one pillar of the new U.S. policy ""is to change the approach in how to deal with Pakistan. We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond.

""Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan,"" Trump continued. ""It has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists.""

After acknowledging that Pakistan's past military cooperation with the U.S. has been valuable, Trump went back to putting the screws on: ""Pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people,"" he said. ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting.

""But that will have to change,"" said Trump, adding ominously: ""And that will change immediately.""

Trump continued: ""No partnership can survive a country's harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order and to peace.""

Although past presidents have criticized Pakistan's double game on terror -- providing some cooperation to the U.S. on the one hand, harboring and sponsoring terrorists on the other hand -- no previous commander-in-chief had delivered this message as bluntly and forcefully as Trump did on Monday.

In case Islamabad somehow still didn't get the message, Trump turned next to Pakistan's arch-rival, India: ""Another critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India, the world's largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States.""

Trump challenged India to do more on Afghanistan: ""We appreciate India's important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development.""

While some might believe that Trump was mildly chiding India on Afghanistan, he was actually turning up the heat again on Pakistan: The last thing the Pakistani government wants is deeper Indian involvement in Afghanistan. Pakistan has long made unsubstantiated accusations that India supports insurgents who use Afghanistan as a base to attack Pakistan. These include separatists seeking independence for Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by land area, whose ethnically and linguistically distinct indigenous population has, according to human rights groups, suffered horrific abuses under Pakistani rule.

The fingerprints of Lisa Curtis, who recently left the Heritage Foundation to become National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster's top aide for South Asia, are evident on the new U.S. policy. Together with Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. and a strong voice against violent extremism, Curtis co-authored a report this year that urged the U.S. to more strongly pressure Pakistan to stop backing terrorist groups. Significantly, this included terrorist groups that focus primarily on attacking India -- ""good terrorists,"" as they're known in some Pakistani military circles.

If the Curtis-Haqqani approach is fully adopted, Pakistan can expect the U.S. to ratchet up pressure with a series of steps -- cutting military aid, downgrading the relationship, possibly declaring Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism -- if Pakistan doesn't cease using terrorism as an instrument of state policy. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, elaborating Tuesday on President Trump's speech, said that such measures ""could be on the table for discussion if in fact they are unwilling to change their posture or change their approach to how they are dealing with the numerous terrorist organizations that find safe haven in Pakistan.""

Although China wasn't mentioned in Trump's speech, Beijing was certainly listening carefully. China, Pakistan's major ally in the region, is investing over $60 billion to create the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a series of infrastructure projects that will create a strategic transportation route for China to Pakistan's deep-water port on the Arabian Sea. China's economic support will buttress Pakistan's ability to withstand a reduction in U.S aid.

On the other side of the equation, Beijing is watching India's blossoming alliance with the U.S. with concern. India is currently locked in a tense military standoff with China over the latter's attempt to build a strategically important road through land claimed by India's neighbor and ally, Bhutan. India and the U.S. have a common interest in containing China, which is aggressively pushing dubious territorial and sea claims against several of its neighbors, including important U.S. allies. The U.S. sees India, a nuclear power on China's border with the world's third largest military, as an important counterweight to China.

Trump's rebuke of Pakistan received a largely positive reaction in the U.S. Congress. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA) said that Pakistan ""remains a fount of radical Islamist thought"" and must be pressed ""to put an end to its destabilizing activities."" Royce's Southern California neighbor, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), shares that sentiment: Last year, along with Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX), he sponsored a bill to declare Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism.

I have written in the past that while our alliance with India is based on shared values, our alliance with Pakistan has always been transactional. Donald Trump, the real estate magnate from New York, knows a thing or two about holding his own in transactional relationships. And as he made crystal clear on Monday, he fully expects Pakistan to start holding up its end of the bargain.","[{'uri': 'david_cohen@dailycaller.com', 'name': 'David Cohen', 'type': 'author',

In the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. Our militaries have worked together against common enemies. The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. We recognize those contributions and those sacrifices.

But Pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country's harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order, and to peace.

Another critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India -- the world's largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States. We appreciate India's important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region (emphasis added).

Trump's toughness on Pakistan drew a lot of comment after the speech, with most observers welcoming it. Everyone understands that developing a closer relationship with India, whatever other goods it would accomplish, is a way to put pressure on Pakistan. Agree or disagree with the policy, it's an intelligible part of a South Asia strategy. Using the threat of action against India on trade, meanwhile, is also defensible as a way of pressuring India to help us in Afghanistan.

Doing both of these things at the same time, however, will be challenging. It means we have to threaten simultaneously to be warmer to India (to pressure Pakistan) and cooler to India (to pressure India). That's going to require some pretty deft diplomacy from the Trump administration.","[{'uri': 'ramesh_ponnuru@nationalreview.com', 'name': 'Ramesh Ponnuru', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'National Review'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistanis', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistanis'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Civilization'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Extremism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Democracy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomacy'}}]",http://c7.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/south%20asia.jpeg,eng-3382459,-0.192156862745098,241207200,1,nationalreview.com,news,National Review,Donald Trump South Asia Terrorism Pakistan National Review India Afghanistan Pakistanis Civilization Extremism United States Democracy Presidency of Donald Trump Diplomacy,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,23,0,18,2017-08-23

The Pakistani government is willing to work closely with the Trump administration to find a political solution on the war in Afghanistan, the ambassador to the United States said.

Ambassador Aizaz Chaudhry said in an interview with USA TODAY that ""the government would facilitate the peace process in whatever manner it can,"" hinting at using Pakistan's influence over the Taliban to get the insurgent group to the negotiation table with the U.S.-backed government of Afghanistan.

His comments came after President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson vowed to step up pressure on Pakistan to work harder for peace in its neighbor to the west.

""Pakistan believes that there should be peace talks with a clear commitment of the government of Afghanistan,"" Chaudhry said, adding that his country has consistently supported the need for an Afghan-led peace process.

Pakistan has its own Taliban movement fighting the government but some agencies, such as the Intelligence services, have allegedly supported the Taliban in Afghanistan.

President Trump on Monday lashed out at Pakistan, urging it to stop giving sanctuary to ""agents of chaos, violence and terror.""

""We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,"" Trump said.

On Tuesday, Tillerson raised the prospects of sanctions against Pakistani government officials, the cut off of aid and putting in jeopardy Pakistan's military partnership with NATO. The Trump administration also has hinted it may improve ties with Pakistan's enemy, India.

The ambassador said his government has reversed the tide of terrorism in Pakistan but it is aware of the fact that Pakistan's gains against terrorists and its economic progress could be at risk if Afghanistan is not stable.

""We, therefore, believe a comprehensive political process must be pursued in earnest to secure lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan,"" he said.

Chaudhry said management of the over 1,500 mile-long Pakistani border with Afghanistan is critical to stopping cross border movement of militants, and that his country has started fencing the border.

""Related issues such as repatriation of refugees back to Afghanistan in honor and dignity as well as a close cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan would also be of singular importance,"" the ambassador said.

Some of these topics have already been discussed through back-channel talks between the U.S. and Pakistan.

On August 11, a group of former diplomats, military officials and security experts from the two countries held their third meeting in six months to discuss Pakistan's support in Afghanistan, increasing U.S. ties with India and New Delhi's role in Afghanistan and Islamabad's shift toward Beijing, Washington's economic rival.

Richard Boucher, former U.S. assistant secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, who attended the talks, said Pakistan and Afghanistan must control their borders to achieve peace.

Boucher acknowledged that Pakistan has expanded its control of its territory, especially into the tribal areas, but stressed that Islamabad ""still needs to control its border to prevent fighters and supplies from moving across in both directions.""

On Monday, Trump outlined an open-ended commitment to the conflict in Afghanistan that pledged more troops and diplomatic outreach to the Taliban. Importantly, Trump publicly tried to pressure Pakistan to end safe havens for terrorists who are striking at Afghanistan. A day later, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson followed up Trump's comments, adding that Pakistan ""must adopt a different approach.""

But this aspect of the Afghan strategy is likely to founder because of China's increasingly close economic ties with Pakistan, which reduces American leverage.

With more than $50 billion in planned infrastructure projects and strong diplomatic support for its positions, American threats to withdraw billions in military aid are becoming less worrying for the powerful army, which dominates foreign policy. With China's role increasing, Pakistan's forces have fewer incentives to stop covertly supporting insurgent groups that strike inside Afghanistan and arch-rival India, while targeting outfits that threaten its own domestic security.

""China is the shield now behind which Pakistan can be expected to continue to play its double game,"" said Harsh Pant, an international relations professor at King's College London. ""The more aid America will cut, Pakistan will be expecting China to fill the vacuum.""

Pakistan has long denied it harbors terrorists. But despite rising frustration from U.S. lawmakers over designated terrorist groups such as the Haqqani Network -- who strike Afghanistan allegedly from inside Pakistan -- China's support for its ally means Pakistan doesn't need to alter course.

In the last four fiscal years, China has directly invested $2.8 billion in Pakistan compared with the $533 million inflows from the U.S., according to Pakistan's central bank. Chinese banks have also helped Pakistan plug its widening deficits. Pakistan received $848 million in loans from China in the six months through December 2016 to finance the country's ""growing current account gap,"" according to the central bank.

Pakistan's foreign ministry released a defiant statement after Trump's speech saying China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi ""lauded Pakistan's contributions and great sacrifices made in the fight against terrorism"" and the ""international community should fully recognize these efforts.""

Later that evening, the foreign ministry released another statement calling Trump's comments part of a ""false narrative."" It also said Trump's strategy will likely fail as U.S. military action hasn't brought peace to Afghanistan in 16 years and probably won't ""in the future.""

""China is at the moment supporting and helping Pakistan's economic development and neutralizing part of the American argument"" pressuring Islamabad, said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a political analyst based in Lahore.

Amounts paid out to Pakistan under a U.S. coalition support fund have fallen 62 percent from $1.44 billion in 2013, with hundreds of millions blocked in the past year as American officials said Pakistan wasn't doing enough to root out groups like the Haqqanis.

Threats to withdraw U.S. military aid entirely aren't going to have much impact, since the U.S. needs Pakistan for its broader efforts in South Asia, Rizvi said. Even if Washington chooses to get tough on Islamabad, ""Pakistan can survive even without any American assistance.""

On Wednesday, Pakistan's army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, told U.S. Ambassador David Hale the military isn't looking for funding, but wants recognition of its contribution in the fight against terrorism. At the same time, Pakistan's government stressed it doesn't want to alienate the U.S.

We won't ""turn our back on the rest of the world on the back of Chinese support,"" said Miftah Ismail, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. ""We want to be friends with every country and America has a role to play.""

Some hope China might use its clout to end regional instability. In an interview this month, Omar Zakhilwal, Afghanistan's ambassador to Pakistan, said he hopes Beijing will use its influence to push for a permanent peace deal.

""China could only be genuinely interested in peace in Afghanistan for its investments in Pakistan,"" Zakhilwal said. ""Instability in any of these countries does not serve China's interest.""

And China has huge interests in Pakistan.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects form the cornerstone of Chinese President Xi Jinping's so-called 'One Belt, One Road' Initiative. And the Chinese funded port of Gwadar gives Beijing a deep sea port in the Arabian Sea, close to mutual rival India -- with whom China is currently engaged in a Himalayan border dispute.

There are also about 20,000 Chinese workers in Pakistan, double the number two years ago, and Pakistan's military is firmly behind CPEC, said one senior Chinese official, who asked not to be named as they aren't authorized to speak to the media.

""Pakistan's pivot towards China, particularly under the CPEC initiative, has been clear for some time,"" said Bilal Khan, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Karachi. ""It remains unclear what the future U.S.-Pakistan economic relationship could look like.""

After being spurned by Trump's criticism, Pakistan is even less likely to agree to a U.S.-directed policy, even if it is accompanied by threats.

""It's nothing new for U.S. leaders to vow to get Pakistan to change its ways,"" said Michael Kugelman, a senior associate for South Asia at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center. ""What remains to be seen is how Trump intends to compel Pakistan to alter its behavior. In all likelihood, Pakistan is unlikely to change its ways regardless of what threat or punishment Trump comes out with.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person',

The United States must value Pakistan's role in Afghanistan and respect its security concerns, China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call, according to Chinese state media.

China's Foreign Ministry defended its ally Pakistan earlier this week after President Donald Trump said the United States could no longer be silent about militants using safe havens on

Pakistani soil.

On Monday, Trump committed the United States to an open-ended conflict in Afghanistan, signalling he would send more troops to America's longest war and vowing ""a fight to win.""

He insisted that others - the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and NATO allies - step up their own commitment to resolving the 16-year conflict, but he saved his sharpest words for Pakistan.

Yang, who outranks China's foreign minister, told Tillerson on Wednesday that China was willing to coordinate with the United States on Afghanistan and make joint efforts to realize peace and stability there and in the region, according to a Chinese statement issued late that night.

""We must value Pakistan's important role on the Afghanistan issue, and respect Pakistan's sovereignty and reasonable security concerns,"" Yang told Tillerson.

Pakistan has been battling home-grown Islamists for years.

It sees Afghanistan as a vital strategic interest and a bulwark against old rival, India. Islamabad denies harboring militants, who move across the porous border with Afghanistan.

China and Pakistan consider each other ""all-weather friends""and have close diplomatic, economic and security ties.

Beijing has its own security concerns in the region, in particular any links between militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan and Islamist groups China blames for violence in its far western region of Xinjiang.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua in Beijing on Tuesday, according to a statement on Thursday. He praised Pakistan's efforts to combat extremism and to secure the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a development initiative central to President Xi Jinping's global Belt and Road development plan.

""Given the current complicated and changing international and regional situation, the strategic significance of China-Pakistan relations is even more prominent,"" Wang said.","[{'uri': 'reuters@cnbc.com', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Jiechi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Yang Jiechi'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"", 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Xinjiang'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Xinjiang'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereignty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Beijing'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Beijing'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China–Pakistan_Economic_Corridor', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'China–Pakistan Economic Corridor'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wang Yi (politician)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Xi Jinping'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Affairs', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'}}]",https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/01/05/103280380-GettyImages-481295289.1910x1000.jpg,eng-3382459,0.5137254901960784,241247400,1,cnbc.com,news,CNBC,Rex Tillerson Donald Trump Diplomat United States Secretary of State Pakistan China Afghanistan Yang Jiechi Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China NATO Foreign minister India Xinjiang Islamism Sovereignty Beijing Islamabad China–Pakistan Economic Corridor Wang Yi (politician) Xi Jinping Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,10,5,2017-08-24

John Nicholson, the top U.S. general in Afghanistan, vowed Thursday.

Nicholson also had a message for the Taliban: ""Stop fighting against your countrymen. Stop killing innocent civilians. Stop bringing hardship and misery to the Afghan people. Lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children.""

Nicholson and Hugo Llorens, the U.S. Embassy's Special Chargé d'Affaires, told reporters in the capital Kabul that President Donald Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan announced Monday was a promise to Afghans that together they would defeat terrorism and prevent terrorist groups from establishing safe havens.

""We will not fail in Afghanistan,"" Nicholson said. ""Our national security depends on it, as well as Afghanistan's security, and our allies and partners.""

But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid was defiant in a telephone interview with The Associated Press: ""We are not giving our guns to any one and our Taliban are fighting until the last U.S. soldier is no longer here in Afghanistan.""

Senior U.S. officials have said that Trump may send up to 3,900 more troops, with some deployments beginning almost immediately. Nicholson did not offer a time frame for deployment, however, saying only that ""in the coming months, U.S. Forces Afghanistan and NATO will increase its train, advise and assist efforts in Afghanistan. And we will increase our air support to Afghan security forces.""

Nicholson had particular praise for Afghanistan's commandos and special forces known as Ktah Khas, saying they had yet to lose a battle and plans were being made to double their size.

""The Taliban have never won against the commandos and Ktah Khas,"" he said. ""They never will.""

Nicholson told reporters that the losses among Taliban foot soldiers have exceeded those of the Afghan National Security Forces, though he didn't offer figures.

The U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in its latest report released July 31 said 2,531 Afghan service members were killed in action in just the first five months of this year and another 4,238 were wounded.

Nicholson said efforts were being made to tackle corruption within the Afghan security force, an issue that was flagged in the same July Inspector General report that identified more than 12,000 Afghan Ministry of Defense personnel that were ""unaccounted for,"" fearing some could be so-called ""ghosts"" who exist only on paper.

Trump too addressed the need for reforms by the Afghan government in his Monday night speech.

""The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results. Our patience is not unlimited,"" Trump said. ""We will keep our eyes wide open.""

Reporters questioned both Nicholson and Llorens about how the U.S. would force Pakistan to close Taliban sanctuaries in its territory. Trump was uncompromising in his demand that Pakistan close the safe havens that the U.S. and Afghanistan have repeatedly accused them of allowing on their soil.

""For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror,"" he said. ""That will have to change, and that will change immediately.""

Nicholson said discussions with Pakistan would be held in private, adding ""it has already started"" without offering more details.

Does it matter?,"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Tuesday afternoon that U.S. funding for Pakistan could be cut if the government doesn't cooperate with the president's strategy in Afghanistan.

""Obviously, we have some leverage that's been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as a non-NATO alliance partner,"" Tillerson told reporters. ""All of that can be put on the table.""

Tillerson's comments follow on President Donald Trump's threat to slash aid to Pakistan as punishment for giving sanctuary to the Taliban and other Islamist militant groups operating in Afghanistan.

""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,"" Trump said Monday evening in his speech announcing the new Afghanistan strategy. ""But that will have to change, and that will change immediately.""

In fact, funding for Pakistan has been falling for some time.

Annual economic and security assistance peaked at more than $3.5 billion in 2011, but the Obama administration and Congress steadily scaled back aid for Pakistan since then, with funding falling below $1 billion in the 2016 budget request.

U.S. assistance to Pakistan falls roughly into three categories: economic aid, security aid and funding to help the country pay for the cost of counter-terrorism operations. The economic assistance includes funding to support Pakistan's agriculture, energy and health sectors, as well as humanitarian aid. Security aid comes under several headings, including counter-narcotics, counterterrorism, military education, money to assist with purchase U.S. military equipment, and transfers of excess military gear.

Amid concern about the threat posed al Qaida militants, U.S. aid to Islamabad increased dramatically in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. But Washington's relationship with Islamabad soured after a series of incidents, including the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad that revealed the al Qaida chief had been hiding in plain sight in Pakistan.

In July, the Trump administration said it was suspending $300 million in aid originally obligated to reimburse Pakistan for counterterrorism operations near the Afghan border. The money is part of the $800 million Coalition Support Fund, which since 2002 has reimbursed Pakistan to the tune of $14 billion.

Washington has also previously cut arms supplies, which the Pakistani military has managed to weather by turning to China or other third parties for aircraft and weapons. In 2016, Congress blocked the sale of eight additional F-16s to Islamabad, citing the continuing support for the Taliban and Haqqani Network.

But the military pipeline remains a key bargaining chip for the United States. The Pakistani air force covets more U.S.-built F-16 aircraft, and pilots are waiting for the shipment of nine more AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters due to be delivered next year for the counterterrorism mission. ""There are a lot of things we could pull off the table,"" said Sameer Lalwani, deputy director of the South Asia program at The Stimson Center.

But Islamabad knows that at some point the Americans will leave Afghanistan, and it sees the Haqqani network and the Taliban as proxy groups needed to assert their influence in Afghanistan. ""It's the only real play they have left,"" Lalwani said.

""Pakistan has an abiding interest in peace and stability of Afghanistan"" Islamabad's ambassador to Washington, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, said Monday. ""We have had to manage the blowback of an unstable Afghanistan for 38 years - more than half of Pakistan's independent life. Our leadership repeatedly, categorically mentioned absence of tolerance and safe havens for any terrorist"" on Pakistani soil.

The American and Pakistani militaries retain close ties, however. The head of U.S. Central Command Gen. Joseph Votel visited the country this week and met with Pakistan's army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, and was flown to the embattled Waziristan area near the Afghan border that has long been a base of militant activity.

Even if Trump doesn't cut funding to Pakistan, there's increasing pressure from Congress to limit U.S. support. In June, two U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill that would revoke Pakistan's status as what's known as a ""Major Non-Nato Ally,"" a legal status that confers certain benefits, such as the transfer of excess defense articles from the U.S. military.

The bill, put forward by Rep. Ted Poe , R-Texas, and Rick Nolan, D-Minn., would target Pakistan's military in ways that cutting funding might not. Countries dubbed Major Non-Nato Allies are eligible for some types of expedited arms deliveries and access to a U.S. loan guarantee program to finance arms exports.

Those familiar with arms transfers done under the Major Non-Nato Ally status said that revoking it would have little more than symbolic effect. It's also unclear how much Washington's military assistance translates into influence over Pakistan.

In late 2011, after U.S. forces mistakenly bombed Pakistani troops inside Pakistan, Islamabad responded by shuttering border crossings along a critical ground route that NATO used for resupply, connecting the port in Karachi and Afghanistan. The route remained closed for months, costing NATO about $100 million a month in extra transportation costs, and helped lead to the dwindling of U.S. aid.

That row, according to The Stimson Center's Lalwani, showed that when confronted by Washington in the past, ""Pakistan hasn't blinked.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson',

John Nicholson, the top U.S. general in Afghanistan, vowed Thursday.

Nicholson also had a message for the Taliban: ""Stop fighting against your countrymen. Stop killing innocent civilians. Stop bringing hardship and misery to the Afghan people. Lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children.""

Nicholson and Hugo Llorens, the U.S. Embassy's Special Chargé d'Affaires, told reporters in the capital Kabul that President Donald Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan announced Monday was a promise to Afghans that together they would defeat terrorism and prevent terrorist groups from establishing safe havens.

""We will not fail in Afghanistan,"" Nicholson said. ""Our national security depends on it, as well as Afghanistan's security, and our allies and partners.""

But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid was defiant in a telephone interview with The Associated Press: ""We are not giving our guns to any one and our Taliban are fighting until the last U.S. soldier is no longer here in Afghanistan.""

Senior U.S. officials have said that Trump may send up to 3,900 more troops, with some deployments beginning almost immediately. Nicholson did not offer a time frame for deployment, however, saying only that ""in the coming months, U.S. Forces Afghanistan and NATO will increase its train, advise and assist efforts in Afghanistan. And we will increase our air support to Afghan security forces.""

Nicholson had particular praise for Afghanistan's commandos and special forces known as Ktah Khas, saying they had yet to lose a battle and plans were being made to double their size.

""The Taliban have never won against the commandos and Ktah Khas,"" he said. ""They never will.""

Nicholson told reporters that the losses among Taliban foot soldiers have exceeded those of the Afghan National Security Forces, though he didn't offer figures.

The U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in its latest report released July 31 said 2,531 Afghan service members were killed in action in just the first five months of this year and another 4,238 were wounded.

Nicholson said efforts were being made to tackle corruption within the Afghan security force, an issue that was flagged in the same July Inspector General report that identified more than 12,000 Afghan Ministry of Defense personnel that were ""unaccounted for,"" fearing some could be so-called ""ghosts"" who exist only on paper.

Trump too addressed the need for reforms by the Afghan government in his Monday night speech.

""The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results. Our patience is not unlimited,"" Trump said. ""We will keep our eyes wide open.""

Reporters questioned both Nicholson and Llorens about how the U.S. would force Pakistan to close Taliban sanctuaries in its territory. Trump was uncompromising in his demand that Pakistan close the safe havens that the U.S. and Afghanistan have repeatedly accused them of allowing on their soil.

""For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror,"" he said. ""That will have to change, and that will change immediately.""

Nicholson said discussions with Pakistan would be held in private, adding ""it has already started"" without offering more details.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Associated Press'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_air_support', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Close air support'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Security Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabiullah_Mujahid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Zabiullah Mujahid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Commando'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'National security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Inspector_General_for_Afghanistan_Reconstruction', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Afghanistan)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Infantry'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Special forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Political corruption'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}]",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/theeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/76/c769f1eb-3830-5f5d-ab9b-89493d89030c/599eb980db4b8.image.jpg?resize=512%2C325,eng-3382459,-0.05882352941176472,241264080,1,theeagle.com,news,The Eagle,Taliban Kabul United States Afghanistan Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Associated Press Close air support NATO Terrorism Demographics of Afghanistan Afghan National Security Forces Zabiullah Mujahid Donald Trump Commando National security Al-Qaeda Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan) Infantry Politics of Afghanistan Special forces Political corruption Pakistan,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,48,9,2017-08-24

""We will not fail in Afghanistan,"" Nicholson said. ""Our national security depends on it, as well as Afghanistan's security, and our allies and partners.""

But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid was defiant in a telephone interview with The Associated Press: ""We are not giving our guns to any one and our Taliban are fighting until the last U.S. soldier is no longer here in Afghanistan.""

Senior U.S. officials have said that Trump may send up to 3,900 more troops, with some deployments beginning almost immediately. Nicholson did not offer a time frame for deployment, however, saying only that ""in the coming months, U.S. Forces Afghanistan and NATO will increase its train, advise and assist efforts in Afghanistan. And we will increase our air support to Afghan security forces.""

Nicholson had particular praise for Afghanistan's commandos and special forces known as Ktah Khas, saying they had yet to lose a battle and plans were being made to double their size.

""The Taliban have never won against the commandos and Ktah Khas,"" he said. ""They never will.""

Nicholson told reporters that the losses among Taliban foot soldiers have exceeded those of the Afghan National Security Forces, though he didn't offer figures.

The U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in its latest report released July 31 said 2,531 Afghan service members were killed in action in just the first five months of this year and another 4,238 were wounded.

Nicholson said efforts were being made to tackle corruption within the Afghan security force, an issue that was flagged in the same July Inspector General report that identified more than 12,000 Afghan Ministry of Defense personnel that were ""unaccounted for,"" fearing some could be so-called ""ghosts"" who exist only on paper.

Trump too addressed the need for reforms by the Afghan government in his Monday night speech.

""The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results. Our patience is not unlimited,"" Trump said. ""We will keep our eyes wide open.""

Reporters questioned both Nicholson and Llorens about how the U.S. would force Pakistan to close Taliban sanctuaries in its territory. Trump was uncompromising in his demand that Pakistan close the safe havens that the U.S. and Afghanistan have repeatedly accused them of allowing on their soil.

""For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror,"" he said. ""That will have to change, and that will change immediately.""

Nicholson said discussions with Pakistan would be held in private, adding ""it has already started"" without offering more details.

(Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)

President Trump's Fort Myer speech was possibly his most coherent, controlled and unobjectionable public articulation since he took charge at the White House.

His remarks, which indicated more troops for Afghanistan, came down like a ton of bricks on Pakistan's continued patronage of terrorist groups. The speech was a lucid -- and long-overdue -- recognition: The United States' 16-year war in Afghanistan has been floundering partly due to Pakistan's dualism on terrorism, as well as Washington's dualism on Pakistan.

Trump's penchant for going madly off-script was contained by a teleprompter, and his speech was likely overseen by national security adviser H.R. McMaster. The remarks were a sharp shift from President Barack Obama's tentative nudging of Pakistan in his 2009 Afghanistan address at West Point.

In that famous speech, Obama committed to a troop ""surge"" in Afghanistan and vowed to start to bring home American soldiers 18 months later. He did speak out against ""safe havens"" for terrorists in Pakistan. But unlike Trump's, his tone was confused and conflicted -- as if he couldn't make up his mind on whether he wanted to support Pakistan or admonish it. Eventually, Obama chose to place the United States and Pakistan on the same side of the trenches in Afghanistan, fighting what he called a ""common enemy."" Obama's contradictory framework allowed Pakistan to continue to draw good-terrorist, bad-terrorist distinctions between extremist groups, with its army acting against the Taliban in areas such as Waziristan and Swat -- while facilitating groups such as the Haqqani network in Afghanistan and the Lashkar-e-Taiba against India with impunity.

Trump has, at least verbally, abandoned Obama's equivocation. ""The next pillar of our new strategy is to change the approach in how to deal with Pakistan,"" he announced, calling out the contradiction of paying ""billions and billions of dollars"" to Pakistan while it is ""housing the very terrorists we are fighting."" Trump reminded the world that 20 U.S-designated terrorist organizations were operational in Pakistan and Afghanistan, making that the highest concentration of terrorist groups anywhere in the world. One of the groups, the Lashkar, which carried out the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, is presently talking about transforming into a political party. That impunity is the precise reason that the Trump administration's shrapnel attack on Pakistan's deep state is music to Afghanistan's and India's ears.

""Well, I think that Trump was wise to consider many different alternatives and arrive at one that reflects a longer-term view of the region (and its challenges),"" Saad Mohseni, often described as Afghanistan's first media mogul, told me. Mohseni, who launched the country's first privately owned radio station and the groundbreaking Tolo TV, argues: ""America has fought one-year wars, 16 times. Interestingly, Trump -- not [former president George W.] Bush or Obama -- has opted to adopt a longer-term approach to countering violent extremism. The likes of Mattis, McMaster and [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph] Dunford know Afghanistan very well. More importantly, they have witnessed Pakistan's meddling close-up. They will not be that easily fooled.""

With an estimated 10,000 U.S troops in Afghanistan and about twice as many contractors, the United States has been working on alternative supply lines that can reduce its logistical dependency on Pakistan. Now, Trump has taken it one step further, with a public pivot to India in his address. Beyond his snarky and childish swipe at how many billions of dollars India makes in trade with the United States, the president's open invitation to India to get more economically involved in Afghanistan is guaranteed to make Pakistan even more apoplectic.

When Trump declared that ""another critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India, the world's largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States,"" it was certainly an official acknowledgment of India as the dominant -- and responsible -- power in the region. India can be forgiven for chortling with satisfaction at the permanent erasure of the long-held hyphen between India and Pakistan. ""The comments by President Trump on Pakistan are certainly welcome,"" Vijay Chauthaiwale, the head of the ruling BJP's foreign affairs department, told me. ""He has rightly blamed Pakistan for being the home ground to terrorism that hits both India and Afghanistan. India is already involved in several development projects in Afghanistan. The appeal from POTUS in this regards will further strengthen USA-India-Afghanistan collaboration.""

India is Afghanistan's largest regional donor -- just last year, it pledged $1 billion in aid to Kabul. It has built more than 2,500 miles of road in Afghanistan, power projects and even the country's new parliament building. No government in Delhi will take dikats from Washington on its Afghanistan policy. However, Trump's address underscores the legitimacy of India's strategic involvement in Afghanistan and presents an opportunity for even more direct engagement.

So what happens next? Pakistan has always looked for ""strategic depth"" in Afghanistan because of paranoia about India's rising influence. Trump's courting of Indian involvement may have two possible outcomes. An enraged security establishment in Pakistan could step up help to terrorist groups to retain control and use it as leverage with the Americans. In other words, brace for an escalation of terrorist violence in Afghanistan. Trump's repudiation of Islamabad is also likely to push it deeper into the protective embrace of China, drawing the lines for another proxy battle of global superpowers.

In India, no one is holding their breath. People want to see whether this is anything more than mere words. But the warning by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of punitive action against Pakistan (this year the United States withheld $350 million in military aid) has raised hopes.

Can Trump be counted on to not unravel on Afghanistan? What if he tweets the exact opposite -- or comes unhinged and has a change of heart? In this one case, Mohseni is putting his money on the president. He tells me what we see as Trump's weakness may end being his strength when it comes to Afghanistan: ""Obama's mistake was to telegraph his intentions by disclosing his endgame to the likes of the Taliban and the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence agency]. All they had to do was to wait him out. Trump's biggest strength is his unpredictability. Folks in Islamabad and Rawalpindi are nervous; they are not sure how far he is willing to go.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Myer', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Fort Myer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Associated Press'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._McMaster', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'H.

Gen. John W. Nicholson, Jr., commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and the acting U.S. ambassador, Hugo Llorens, spoke about the importance of reaching a settlement with the Taliban in attempts to end the nearly 16-year war.

Afghans see a peace pact as crucial to future stability, but Trump's address on Monday seemed to dismiss an accord as a vague possibility. Both U.S. officials insisted they were not breaking ranks with the White House, but framed their comments as additional details and reinforcement of Trump's message.

""We are determined to pursue the goal of a political settlement. As these terrorist groups realize that they cannot win, they will see that their best option is to pursue peace,"" Nicholson said.

He invited the Taliban to ""stop bringing hardship and misery to the Afghan people. Lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children.""

Although Afghan officials immediately embraced Trump's message, many Afghan analysts and commentators expressed concern this week that it would be focused too narrowly on fighting the Taliban and terrorist groups. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai called it a formula based on ""killing, killing, killing.""

Many Afghans also expressed worries about Trump's declaration that the U.S. government would no longer pursue ""nation-building"" in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The United States has invested billions of dollars in aid, advisers and projects to help build Afghanistan's democracy and economy since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001.

Nicholson and Llorens -- following similar reassurances made by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington after Trump's speech -- emphasized that the new policy would be much more than a battle plan. Llorens said it would ""integrate all the instruments of American power,"" including diplomacy and economic support.

Llorens described a newly launched ""compact"" between Washington and the Afghan National Unity government, which he said ""codifies"" a number of areas in which the two governments have agreed to cooperate, such as fighting corruption and promoting investment.

Nicholson, however, repeatedly returned to the theme of America's staunch military commitment to the war effort, vowing to pursue and ""annihilate"" Islamic State forces in Afghanistan and to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorists, who ""wish to attack the rest of the world from Afghan soil.""

Like Trump, he declined to say how many additional U.S. troops would be sent. But he sought to counter critic that the new military strategy would follow that same path as others that have failed to make significant headway in the conflict, even with more than 100,000 international troops in Afghanistan at one time.

One difference he cited was cooperation from the current Afghan government, which he called ""a trusted and willing partner"" that seeks to reform and professionalize the security forces. He also repeatedly praised the Afghan special operations forces, which are going to be doubled in size and trained by U.S. and NATO advisers.

""These brave soldiers have never lost a battle, and they never will,"" Nicholson said. ""With the additional support we will provide them, they will become larger and more lethal.""

Another change he mentioned was the shift from an American strategy of support based on ""arbitrary timelines"" to one ""guided by conditions on the ground.""

Trump did not specify those conditions, and many Afghans have asked this week what they would involve. Comments by Tillerson, followed by Lloren and Nicholson, suggested that progress on fighting corruption and holding elections could be key.

Story highlightsPresident Trump criticized Pakistan in a speech on Monday""To scapegoat Pakistan will not help in stabilizing Afghanistan,"" Pakistan's council said

(CNN)Pakistan's National Security Council issued a strongly worded rebuttal on Thursday to President Donald Trump's remarks that Pakistan provided ""safe havens for terrorist organizations.""

""The (National Security) Committee outrightly rejected the specific allegations and insinuations made against Pakistan,"" the council said in a statement. ""To scapegoat Pakistan will not help in stabilizing Afghanistan. In fact, being its immediate neighbor, Pakistan has an abiding interest in peace and stability in Afghanistan.""The rebuttal comes days after Trump's speech Monday in which he announced that the US military would expand its presence in the war in Afghanistan, now in its 16th year. In particular, Trump had harsh words for Pakistan, the US ally that borders Afghanistan to the south. He said Washington could ""no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations.""""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars. At the same time, they are housing the very terrorists we are fighting ... that must change immediately,"" Trump added.Read MoreIn its statement, Pakistan defended its role in the lengthy war and said it has worked to promote peace in Afghanistan.""The Committee observed that Pakistan has consistently supported all international efforts for a stable and peaceful Afghanistan,"" the council's statement said. ""On its own part, Pakistan has taken indiscriminate actions against all terrorist networks and sacrificed tens of thousands of troops and civilians in this fight."" US officials have long accused Pakistan's leadership of not doing enough to stabilize Afghanistan and have suspected that Pakistan knowingly hid terrorists. For example, when US soldiers killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin in a raid in Pakistan in May 2011, White House officials did not inform Islamabad ahead of time. In addition, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar died in April 2013 in Pakistan, a spokesperson for Afghanistan's president said in 2015.""Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan (and) much to lose from harboring criminals and terrorists,"" Trump said in his speech Monday.

Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and the acting U.S. ambassador, Hugo Llorens, spoke about the importance of reaching a settlement with the Taliban in attempts to end the nearly 16-year war.

Afghans see a peace pact as crucial to future stability, but Trump's address on Monday seemed to dismiss an accord as a vague possibility. Both U.S. officials insisted they were not breaking ranks with the White House, but framed their comments as additional details and reinforcement of Trump's message.

""We are determined to pursue the goal of a political settlement. As these terrorist groups realize that they cannot win, they will see that their best option is to pursue peace,"" Nicholson said.

He invited the Taliban to ""stop bringing hardship and misery to the Afghan people. Lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children.""

Although Afghan officials immediately embraced Trump's message, many Afghan analysts and commentators expressed concern this week that it would be focused too narrowly on fighting the Taliban and terrorist groups. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai called it a formula based on ""killing, killing, killing.""

Many Afghans also expressed worries about Trump's declaration that the U.S. government would no longer pursue ""nation-building"" in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The United States has invested billions of dollars in aid, advisers and projects to help build Afghanistan's democracy and economy since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001.

Nicholson and Llorens - following similar reassurances made by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington after Trump's speech - emphasized that the new policy would be much more than a battle plan. Llorens said it would ""integrate all the instruments of American power,"" including diplomacy and economic support.

Llorens described a newly launched ""compact"" between Washington and the Afghan National Unity government, which he said ""codifies"" a number of areas in which the two governments have agreed to cooperate, such as fighting corruption and promoting investment.

Nicholson, however, repeatedly returned to the theme of America's staunch military commitment to the war effort, vowing to pursue and ""annihilate"" Islamic State forces in Afghanistan and to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorists, who ""wish to attack the rest of the world from Afghan soil.""

Like Trump, he declined to say how many additional U.S. troops would be sent. But he sought to counter critic that the new military strategy would follow that same path as others that have failed to make significant headway in the conflict, even with more than 100,000 international troops in Afghanistan at one time.

One difference he cited was cooperation from the current Afghan government, which he called ""a trusted and willing partner"" that seeks to reform and professionalize the security forces. He also repeatedly praised the Afghan special operations forces, which are going to be doubled in size and trained by U.S. and NATO advisers.

""These brave soldiers have never lost a battle, and they never will,"" Nicholson said. ""With the additional support we will provide them, they will become larger and more lethal.""

Another change he mentioned was the shift from an American strategy of support based on ""arbitrary timelines"" to one ""guided by conditions on the ground.""

Trump did not specify those conditions, and many Afghans have asked this week what they would involve. Comments by Tillerson, followed by Lloren and Nicholson, suggested that progress on fighting corruption and holding elections could be key.

Trump continued criticizing Pakistan for providing ""safe haven"" to terror groups during the speech. Trump's speech outlined his administration's new policy for the war on terror in Afghanistan; a reevaluation of the U.S.'s relationship with Pakistan, as well as its neighbor and rival India, was a key pillar of the strategy Trump outlined.

Verdict: True

Pakistan has never officially admitted to consciously ""housing"" or supporting terror groups. Investigations of previous terrorist attacks and public statements by Pakistani government officials, however, reveal that Pakistani government bodies and agents have harbored and supported terror groups - all while the U.S. has indeed provided ""billions and billions"" in military and civilian aid to the country.

A year after the brutal November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, the FBI arrested a man named David Headley for involvement in the attacks. Headley, born Daood Gilani to an American mother and Pakistani father, conducted multiple surveillance missions in Mumbai for the 2008 attacks and in Copenhagen for a planned Charlie Hebdo-style attack on a Danish newspaper, all using his U.S. passport as cover.

A 2010 report by India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) - after the NIA was granted permission to interview Headley in the U.S. - revealed the extent of Pakistani involvement in the gruesome Mumbai attacks that left over 170 dead.

Headley explained to Indian investigators and the FBI how ""every important member of LeT [the Pakistani-based terror group responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks] is handled by one or more ISI officials."" The ""ISI,"" or Inter-Services Intelligence, is Pakistan's intelligence agency. Headley admitted to having two ISI handlers himself and also confessed having knowledge of what the report described as joint ""LeT / ISI safe houses.""

Headley had also confessed direct involvement of the Pakistani military in the LeT and 2008 terrorist attacks. Headley recalled to investigators that one of his LeT colleagues ""visited several Pakistan army installations"" and how he personally believed that the boat used by the LeT extremists to penetrate Mumbai for their operation was ""from the Pakistani navy.""

A few months later, Pervez Musharraf - a former high-ranking Pakistani general and exiled Pakistani president - echoed these themes of Pakistan's official support of and involvement with terrorism.

In an October 2010 interview with Musharraf, Der Spiegel - a German weekly news magazine - asked Musharraf why Pakistan formed ""militant underground groups,"" or terrorist camps, to combat India. Musharraf confirmed the groups' existence and admitted that the Pakistani government ""turned a blind eye because [it] wanted India to discuss Kashmir [a region disputed between India and Pakistan].""

When confronted by Spiegel about Pakistani security forces training terrorists, Musharraf responded by blaming ""The West"" for ""ignoring"" tensions over Kashmir. Spiegel asked if that gave Pakistan ""the right to train underground fighters."" Musharraf responded in the affirmative: ""Yes, it is the right of any country to promote its own interests when India is not prepared to discuss Kashmir... [or] resolve the dispute in a peaceful manner.""

Headley's or Musharraf's statements are only two examples in a long list of evidence linking the Pakistani government and Pakistani officials to terrorism. In the absence of official Pakistani acknowledgment, however, these statements are elucidative firsthand accounts of high-level policy making in an opaque country.

There is, moreover, a semblance of consensus in the international community and among independent researchers and think tanks that Pakistan is a state-sponsor of terrorism.

Numerous high-level foreign leaders have criticized or condemned Pakistan for its terror links, including former British Prime Minister David Cameron, Bangladeshi Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Canadian Citizenship & Immigration Minister Chris Alexander, and a litany of Indian leaders.

A 2008 report by the Brookings Institution, a progressive think tank, discusses how Pakistan ""has long supported a range of [Kashmir-related] terrorist groups... and is a major sponsor of Taliban forces fighting the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan.""

A 2017 issue brief by the Heritage Foundation, following a similar line of reasoning and evidence, recommended that ""NATO leaders"" should attempt to ""pressure"" Pakistan to ""stop providing relief to the Taliban.""

Some U.S. lawmakers have listened to these and countless other assessments. Most notably before the Trump presidency, in September 2016, Republican Rep. Ted Poe of Texas and Democratic Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California introduced a bill to Congress to review Pakistan's record on terror and likely designate it as a state sponsor of terrorism.

Although Pakistan has repeatedly denied it, the evidence, alongside domestic and international consensus, acknowledge the Islamic Republic's support of terror groups and activities.

Trump is also correct that the U.S. paid Pakistan ""billions and billions"" while the country organized and bankrolled radical Islamic terrorism.

The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) estimates that from the fiscal year (FY) 2002 - roughly indicative of the start of the War on Terror - to FY2016, the U.S. has appropriated nearly eight billion dollars in ""Security-Related"" aid to Pakistan. (The FAS underscores that this is likely an overstatement of the actual aid total as the U.S. can and has withheld appropriated aid funds.)

FAS additionally estimates that the U.S., between FY2002 and FY2016, paid (not appropriated) Pakistan around $14.5 billion for ""Coalition Support Funds"" - payments essentially for logistical and operational support of U.S.-led military efforts in neighboring, landlocked Afghanistan.

These $22 billion of defense-related appropriations and payments are in addition to FAS' estimate of another nearly $11 billion in economic and humanitarian aid appropriations to Pakistan during the same time span. Combined, these appropriations and payments total $33 billion over a decade and a half.

Trump's claim that the U.S. has ""been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars"" as it was ""housing the very terrorists that we are fighting"" holds up to the facts.","[{'uri':

The message also reiterated Islamabad's rejection of Trump's allegation that Pakistan harbors militants who battle U.S. forces across the border in Afghanistan. In turn, the Pakistani officials demanded that the U.S. military eliminate militants who use Afghan soil to stage attacks in Pakistan.

Islamabad's response followed an hours-long meeting between Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and army chiefs, all members of the National Security Committee - Pakistan's top forum on issues relating to the country's defense and security.

Trump's remarks on Monday, in which he lashed out at Pakistan, an ostensible U.S. ally, blaming it for violence in Afghanistan, and demanding that Islamabad stop giving sanctuary to ""agents of chaos, violence and terror,"" have shocked Pakistan.

They have also drawn nationwide condemnation. Pakistan's opposition has asked Abbasi to cancel a scheduled visit by Pakistan's foreign minister to Washington. Pakistan's top opposition leader, cricket-star-turned-politician Imran Khan, also demanded Abbasi convene a special session of Parliament to discuss Trump's threats.

Thursday's meeting of the National Security Committee also noted Trump's comment in which he said Washington paid billions of dollars to Pakistan - only to have it shelter terrorists.

""Scapegoating Pakistan will not help in stabilizing Afghanistan,"" the committee said, according to a statement issued by the premier's office. It also called for recognition by the Trump administration of Pakistan's many sacrifices - thousands of civilians and security forces have lost their lives in the country's fight against insurgency and militancy on its own soil. The struggle has also cost this Islamic nation $120 billion in economic losses.

However, U.S. officials and analysts have long accused Pakistan of playing a double-game with Islamic extremists - supporting those that threaten its rivals in India and Afghanistan while cracking down on those who target its own citizens.

The committee reiterated Pakistan's commitment that it will not allow its soil to be used for violence against any other country.

""We expect the same from our neighbors,"" it said - a reference to Afghanistan and India.

Trump's claims of giving billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan were ""misleading to the extent that the reimbursements to Pakistan since 2001 only account for part of the cost of ground facilities and air corridors used by the United States for its operations in Afghanistan, rather than any financial aid or assistance,"" the statement stressed.

The meeting pledged to continue helping international community to ensure peace in Afghanistan.

Pakistan has been at war with the Pakistani Taliban and homegrown extremists for years, but it has also long tolerated the Afghan Taliban and the allied Haqqani network, which have been behind many attacks in Afghanistan.

Islamabad has also been under international pressure to try and bring the Taliban leaders, based in Pakistan's restive southwestern region since their rule in Afghanistan was overthrown in the 2001 U.S. invasion, into some form of negotiations with Kabul.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Associated Press'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Imran Khan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Parliament of the United Kingdom'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic extremism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islam'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}]",,eng-3382459,-0.2627450980392156,241291680,1,hosted.ap.org,news,Associated Press,"Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Donald Trump Islamabad United States Pakistan Afghanistan Associated Press Imran Khan Parliament of the United Kingdom United States Armed Forces Foreign minister Washington, D.C.

Bush's and Barack Obama's before him.

At best, the reported dispatch of an additional 4,000 American troops will prevent the total collapse of Afghanistan and thwart the Taliban from winning. Given the complex nature of the conflict, however, the status quo will not change in any significant way.

One might think that after 16 years, the US would have learned that the Taliban will not be defeated. Indeed, the only solution rests on a negotiated agreement with the Taliban, while inviting the Afghan tribes to do the heavy lifting, since they are the only party that can effectively work with the Taliban to reach an enduring agreement.

The only pointed and correct statement that Trump made about his ""new strategy"" is that the US should not undertake the practice of nation-building, and certainly should not dictate how the Afghan people live their lives and govern themselves. The US, with the support of the tribes, should focus on combating terrorism, especially from Al Qaeda, ISIS and other radical extremist groups.

The Taliban should receive a clear signal that they are an important part of the new strategy to reach a peace accord, provided that they demonstrate their willingness to negotiate in earnest and renounce terrorism.

It is true and necessary that the US must develop strategic partnerships, especially with India and Pakistan, to help in the fight against terrorism, and that Washington should use its political, economic and military assets to that end.

However, whereas India should be willing to partner with the US, it is not a given that the besieged Pakistani government will be able to fully commit itself even if it chooses to do so, because a.) the ongoing political turmoil in Islamabad prevents the development of a cohesive policy to combat the plethora of terrorist groups; and b.) Pakistan does not want to fight the Taliban -- because they might soon become part of the Afghan government.

For these reasons, it is naive to think that after 16 years of fighting, dispatching an additional military force of 4,000 soldiers will change anything. In fact, at its peak of more than 100,000 American soldiers, the US was unable to dramatically change the dynamic of the conflict and create a sustainable political and security structure that would allow US troops to leave.

No one in the Trump administration, including the Pentagon, is offering any convincing argument that additional forces will win the war. At best, they can arrest the continuing advances of the Taliban, which is now in control of nearly half the country.

Trump's effort, therefore, will succeed only if the US immediately embraces peace talks while fighting foreign terrorist groups.

There will not be a military solution to the Afghan war. Yet Trump has now the opportunity to change the dynamic of the conflict by looking at the Taliban not as the enemy, but as the partner in the search for a sustainable solution.

The sooner the US accepts this reality, the better.

In a conversation that I had with Ajmal Khan Zazai, the tribal leader and paramount chief of the Paktia province in Afghanistan, he noted that previous American military approaches have never had a chance of succeeding, due to their ""[obsession] with their version of 'democracy' and 'human rights.'"" He emphasized the fact that ""Afghanistan is a tribal country, the tribes are the past, present, and the future."" Excluding the tribes from the battle against violent extremism, including Al Qaeda and ISIS, will simply not work.

To prevent repeating past mistakes, the Trump administration must now reach out to the tribal chiefs and together develop a strategy that would allow the Taliban to fully participate in peace talks.

The chiefs would require US financial assistance, to the tune of 400-500 million dollars a year (which is a fraction of what we spend today). The purpose of this would be to recruit and train their own militias to fight against the assortment of terrorists.

To be sure, the Taliban are Afghan nationals and will not be dislodged from their own land. They know that time is on their side because every foreign power has been forced to eventually leave the country. If the US wants to end this debilitating war, it must focus on local forces for a permanent solution, and leave Afghanistan sooner rather than later -- and with some dignity.","[{'uri': 'alon_ben_meir@algemeiner.com', 'name': 'Alon Ben-Meir', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'George W.

Following statements from President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton bashing Pakistan for harboring terrorists, the office of Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi released a rare statement in response.

""We would like to see effective and immediate U.S. military efforts to eliminate sanctuaries harbouring terrorists and miscreants on Afghan soil, including those responsible for fomenting terror in Pakistan,"" the prime minister's office said in a statement, Reuters reports.

Not only did Abbasi's office refer to the Afghan Taliban, but it also stated that the Pakistan Taliban has outposts in Afghanistan, as well.

Further, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif complained that Washington was using Pakistan as a scapegoat to cover up its military failings in Afghanistan. The war in Afghanistan is now America's longest war, spanning 16 years, but despite the amount of time U.S. troops have spent in the region, the Taliban still either controls or contests about 40 percent of all districts in Afghanistan, according to a quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

While President Donald Trump has in the past pushed for troop withdrawal in Afghanistan, he recently was persuaded otherwise by his advisers and now has authorized a new troop surge, though it's unclear how many troops will be sent over. However, Trump has emphasized that even though more troops will enter the war theater, he is not interested in ""nation-building.""

""I share the American people's frustration,"" Trump said in his address on Afghanistan strategy. ""I also share their frustration over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money -- and, most importantly, lives -- trying to rebuild countries in our own image instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations.""

Part of the strategy calls for a renewed toughness on Pakistan, which is believed to be providing safe haven for terror groups to launch attacks into Afghanistan. On a call with reporters Tuesday, Anton said that the U.S. is considering levying sanctions against Pakistan terror groups and also on any Pakistani officials with ties too close to these groups.","[{'uri': 'jonah_bennett@dailycaller.com', 'name': 'Jonah Bennett', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'sanctuaries_harbouring_terrorists@dailycaller.com', 'name': 'Sanctuaries Harbouring Terrorists', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Prime Minister of Pakistan'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Reuters'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Inspector_General_for_Afghanistan_Reconstruction', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Economic sanctions'}}]",http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/taliban4-e1503594845792.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.2862745098039216,241294680,1,dailycaller.com,news,The Daily Caller,"Terrorism United States Pakistan Afghanistan Donald Trump United States Armed Forces Rex Tillerson Khawaja Muhammad Asif Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan Prime Minister of Pakistan United States National Security Council Taliban United States Secretary of State Reuters Foreign minister Washington, D.C.

Gen. John Nicholson said President Trump's new plan for the Afghanistan war shows Afghans that ""the United States and our NATO Allies and partners are with you. We stand with your security forces against terrorists and the enemies of Afghanistan.""

""Along with our Afghan partners, we will relentlessly pursue ISIS-K and annihilate them,"" Nicholson told reporters in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. ""We will continue to crush the remnants of al Qaeda, and we will increase our pressure on all terrorist groups in Afghanistan.""

Trump

Nicholson would not offer any specifics on the new plan but said that ""in the coming months, U.S. Forces Afghanistan and NATO will increase its train, advise and assist efforts in Afghanistan. And we will increase our air support to Afghan security forces.""

He also urged the Taliban to join peace negotiations, insisting that they could not win on the battlefield.

""Stop fighting against your countrymen. Stop killing innocent civilians. Stop bringing hardship and misery to the Afghan people. Lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children,"" Nicholson said.

But the effort likely faces an uphill climb, with the Taliban's hold on part of the country showing no signs of relenting

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told The Associated Press after Nicholson's speech that the group would ""not giving our guns to any one and our Taliban are fighting until the last U.S. soldier is no longer here in Afghanistan.""

Nicholson, who had commanded both of U.S. and NATO forces in the country since March 2016, made several references to the president's Monday night address.

""As President Trump said in his speech, and I quote: 'These killers need to know that they have nowhere to hide. These killers need to know that no place is beyond the reach of American might and American arms.'""

Trump reportedly suggested firing Nicholson in July after being fed up with the state of the 16-year war and the options being presented to him.

""We aren't winning,"" Trump reportedly said during a Situation Room meeting on Afghanistan. ""We are losing.""

Nicholson also said Trump's approach is different than the past because it is now ""guided by conditions on the ground and not arbitrary timelines,"" it ""provides for more U.S. and NATO resources,"" and international commitment to Afghanistan ""has gotten stronger in the last year.""","[{'uri': 'ellen_mitchell@thehill.com', 'name': 'Ellen Mitchell', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ethnic groups in Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Security Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Associated Press'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabiullah_Mujahid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Zabiullah Mujahid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International Security Assistance Force'}}]",http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/nicholsonjohn_020416getty.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.05882352941176472,241297920,1,thehill.com,news,The Hill,Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Donald Trump Afghanistan NATO Taliban Al-Qaeda Terrorism Ethnic groups in Afghanistan Afghan National Security Forces Kabul Demographics of Afghanistan Associated Press Zabiullah Mujahid International Security Assistance Force,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,12,19,2017-08-24

At a news conference in the Afghan capital, the military commander for US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John W. Nicholson, said that the influx of new troops -- mostly trainers for the Afghan security forces -- would continue over the next few months.

He did not provide details on the number of troops, and he emphasized that US forces would remain in Afghanistan with no prestated timeline for withdrawal. Previous reports have suggested that the increase, which Trump has put in the hands of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former Marine general, would amount to around 4,000 additional US troops.

They would be joining a US force that officially totals about 8,400, but that the Pentagon recently acknowledged to The Wall Street Journal is closer to 12,000. More than 4,000 troops from other NATO countries are also said to be in Afghanistan.

""There will be additional capabilities, some of that is already arriving,"" Nicholson said. ""But we are not going to talk about the specific numbers. We are not going to telegraph to the enemy what it is we are going to do and how we are going to influence the battlefield.""

Nicholson said that air support to the Afghan forces would also be ramping up. That support has already been extensive in a year of major territorial gains for the Taliban insurgency. The US Air Force reported dropping about 1,250 bombs and other ordnance in the first seven months of this year, almost twice as many as in the same period last year.

At the same news conference, the top US diplomat in Afghanistan, Hugo Llorens, said that the new commitment was a message to the Taliban that negotiation would be the only way out of the war.

""The Taliban has a choice: they can continue to kill fellow Afghans and terrorize communities in a conflict they have no possibility of winning,"" Llorens said. ""Or they can seek reconciliation and put an end to the war.""

Though Trump's Afghan strategy announcement came Monday, discussion within the administration and the Pentagon over the increase in troops had gone on for months, including plans for how to deploy them.

On Thursday, Nicholson characterized the new strategy in Afghanistan as defining success by conditions on the ground and not ""arbitrary timelines."" And he described the Taliban as a criminal organization increasingly focused on its profit from the drug trade.

The Taliban reacted to the news conference in real time, with one Twitter account associated with the insurgents saying that the general ""describes Taliban as criminals & still wants Taliban to join his rotten political process.""

After nearly 16 years of war, the new troop commitment without deadlines is also a tacit US commitment to a conflict that is not going well. Though US officials insist that the Afghan forces must bear the brunt of the fighting, they also acknowledge a long road ahead for army and police forces that have lost men in record numbers.

The officials have also signaled frustration with the pace of reform in the national police forces, which are widely seen as unruly and corrupt despite years of international assistance and training.

Llorens said that along with the US policy shift, the Afghan government had also initiated a long list of commitments to reform. On Wednesday, the Afghan government and US officials signed a bilateral compact on those commitments, with hundreds of specific actions listed, Llorens said.","[{'uri': 'defense_department@bostonglobe.com', 'name': 'Defense Department', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'mujib_mashal@bostonglobe.com', 'name': 'Mujib Mashal', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'jawad_jalali@bostonglobe.com', 'name': 'Jawad Jalali', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'The Boston Globe'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Mattis', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Jim Mattis'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Security Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_air_support', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Close air support'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of Defense'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International Security Assistance Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_warfare', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Aerial warfare'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Pentagon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Wall Street Journal'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Organized crime'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Air Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Illegal drug trade'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ammunition'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}]",http://www.bostonglobe.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2017/08/24/BostonGlobe.com/Foreign/Images/06159230.jpg,eng-3382459,0.2,241304940,1,bostonglobe.com,news,The Boston Globe,United States Afghanistan The Boston Globe Donald Trump Taliban United States Armed Forces Kabul Jim Mattis Afghan National Security Forces Close air support Afghan Armed Forces United States Secretary of Defense International Security Assistance Force NATO Aerial warfare The Pentagon The Wall Street Journal Taliban insurgency Organized crime United States Air Force Illegal drug trade Ammunition Insurgency Twitter Politics of Afghanistan,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,9,21,2017-08-24

(David Guttenfelder/AP)

In this occasional series, we will bring you up to speed on the biggest national security stories of the week.

President Trump outlined his strategy for the war in Afghanistan Monday night during a speech at Fort Myer in Arlington, Va. The new direction would likely call for an increase of thousands of troops to assist and train Afghan forces. Trump also emphasized he would step away from ""nation building."" The administration also plans to put more pressure on Pakistan to eradicate safe havens for terrorists, and the president indicated that India would assist in economic and development support.

Ending the 16-year conflict has eluded former presidents, and Trump has made it no secret that he considers the war too costly. He said his first instinct when considering what to do was to pull out. The war for some time has been described by numerous analysts as a stalemate with the Taliban continuing to grow stronger while rampant corruption continues to plague the Afghan government, hampering U.S. military initiatives.

Many experts and veterans contend that Trump's plans for the country remain much like those of his predecessor, former president Barack Obama: Strengthen the Afghan government forces on the battlefield in hopes a bloodied Taliban will come to the negotiating table to negotiate a political solution.

Here's what you need to know about the longest conflict in U.S. history:

Soldiers are still deployed to the region -- and still dying.

About 8,500 U.S. troops have remained in Afghanistan since Obama officially ended the combat mission there. There are also NATO troops that work with the U.S. military to train, advise and assist Afghan security forces, as well as U.S. Special Operations forces on a separate counterterrorism mission targeting al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. If more troops deploy to the region, they would likely continue to help the Afghan military fight a resurgent Taliban with more air support and other resources.

Ten U.S. service members have been killed this year -- three of whom died in June when an Afghan soldier opened fire on American troops battling the Islamic State in Nangahar province. The most recent death occurred last week when Staff Sgt. Aaron R. Butler, 27, was killed by an improvised explosive device.

The U.S. has spent billions of dollars fighting the war.

More than $700 billion has been spent to fund reconstruction and war efforts in Afghanistan, and the troop increase will likely add billions of dollars more to the cost of the conflict. Military strategists predict direct U.S. spending could balloon up to $840 billion. Those costs also include spending on the treatment of veterans' medical and disability needs.

In some instances, the money American taxpayers contributed has been squandered. One infamous example includes a $6 million program designed to breed Italian and Afghan goats for better cashmere to improve the yield. The experiment failed when many of the goats became sick and died.

""I'm not sure flying Italian goats into Afghanistan was exactly what the founders had in mind when they created a standing army for the United States,"" said John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.

Corruption in Afghanistan is a major obstacle.

Corruption remains a widespread problem in both the Afghan government and its armed forces. In March, more than 1,000 Afghan army service members were fired following corruption charges. A prominent Afghan general who was in charge of the restive Helmand province -- a region where U.S. and Afghan soldiers have experienced some of the deadliest fighting -- is also on trial on embezzlement and corruption charges.

President Ashraf Ghani and his attorney general have launched a campaign to target senior officials in an effort to boost public confidence in the government, but the president also has to address widespread joblessness and anxiety about security of the country.

The Islamic State and the Taliban continue to launch major terrorist attacks.

The Taliban has recently been responsible for some of the country's deadliest attacks in years. More than 140 Afghan soldiers were killed or wounded in April when a group of insurgents dressed in army uniforms stormed a heavily fortified base, detonating suicide vests and throwing grenades. The assault rattled the country, which was already reeling from an Islamic State attack that killed dozens in one of the country's largest military hospitals. The attacks were major blows to the U.S. war effort to help the Afghan army become self-sustaining.

Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and the senior U.S. embassy official, special charge' d'affairs Hugo Llorens, spoke at a joint news conference about the importance of reaching a settlement with the Taliban in attempt to end the nearly 16-year war.

Trump's address Monday dwelled on ""winning"" the war and depicted an accord as a remote possibility. Both U.S. officials were careful to avoid contradicting the president, framing their comments as additional ""details"" and reinforcement of his message.

""We are determined to pursue the goal of a political settlement. As these terrorist groups realize that they cannot win, they will see that their best option is to pursue peace,"" Nicholson said. He invited the Taliban to ""lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children.""

Although Afghan officials embraced Trump's message, many Afghan commentators expressed concern this week that it focused too narrowly on fighting the Taliban and terrorists. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai called it a formula based on ""killing, killing, killing.""

Afghans also voiced worries about Trump's declaration that the U.S. government would no longer pursue ""nation-building"" in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The United States has invested billions of dollars in efforts to rebuild Afghanistan since 2001, yet the country is still struggling with political divisions and a moribund economy.

Nicholson and Llorens - following similar reassurances made by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington after Trump's speech - emphasized that the new policy would be much more than a battle plan. Llorens said it would ""integrate all the instruments of American power,"" including diplomacy and economic support.

But Nicholson also emphasized the U.S. military commitment to the war effort, vowing to pursue and ""annihilate"" Islamic State forces in Afghanistan and to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for international terrorists.

Like Trump, the general declined to say how many additional U.S. troops would be sent. But he rejected criticism that the new military strategy would echo previous U.S. policies that failed to make significant headway, even with more than 100,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan at one time.

One difference Nicholson cited was the current Afghan government, which he called a ""trusted"" partner that seeks to ""reform and professionalize"" the security forces. He also praised the Afghan special operations forces, which will be doubled in size and trained by U.S. and NATO advisers.

""These brave soldiers have never lost a battle,"" Nicholson said. ""With the additional support we will provide them, they will become larger and more lethal.""

Nicholson also expressed concern for the high level of war casualties suffered by Afghans, saying, ""The United States deeply appreciates and respects the sacrifice and strength of the Afghan people."" Rising casualty rates have become a source of growing concern here, with more than 11,000 Afghan civilians killed or injured last year.

Nicholson also touted the shift from an American strategy of support based on ""arbitrary timelines"" to one ""guided by conditions"" on the ground. ""You can believe it will be different because we removed the calendar from the equation,"" he said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Nicholson_Jr.', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'John W.

The Korean Peninsula and the Middle East come immediately to mind. Afghanistan also belongs on that list -- something President Donald Trump has finally come to realize, seven months after taking office.

The Los Angeles Times reports that, although he didn't offer a specific number during his Monday night address to the nation, Trump is poised to send roughly 4,000 more U.S. troops to the South Asian country, the site of the longest war in America's history. Like their countrymen already in Afghanistan, these Americans won't be a combat force. They'll carry out counterterrorism missions and advise Afghan officers fighting on the front lines against a resurgent Taliban.

Until Monday, Trump had said little about the Afghan conflict, and had not acted on pleas from top military advisers to beef up the U.S. military contingent in Afghanistan. Instead, he had focused on the Islamic State's presence in northern Iraq and Syria, while keeping Afghanistan as a policy to be determined.

Trump was right to continue helping the Iraqi government root out Islamic State from that country's second largest city, Mosul, and right to arm Syrian Kurdish fighters in their bid to defeat Islamic State in Raqqa, the militant group's Syrian stronghold. The Islamic State's footprint in Iraq and Syria has shrunk considerably, and continues to shrink.

We also think he's right to broaden the U.S. role in Afghanistan. That country matters -- this war matters -- because America can pay a high price when it glances away from lands vulnerable to terrorist takeover. Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, paid that price in Syria and Iraq. Obama's troop withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 left that country in a state of chaos, and Islamic State rose from the ashes of al-Qaida in Iraq. Obama's policy in Syria was halfhearted and troubled -- recall the $500 million train-and-equip program for Syrian rebel fighters that yielded only a handful of troops. Many factors contributed to the Islamic State burgeoning into the world's most feared terrorist group, but Obama's reluctance to take stronger stands in Iraq and Syria played a part.

Is there a danger of Afghanistan again becoming a terrorist haven, as it once was for al-Qaida before 9/11? Without a doubt. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's military can't tamp down the carnage, and only 8,400 U.S. and 5,000 NATO troops are there now to train and support them. Ambushes and suicide bomb attacks kill Afghan security forces and civilians with harrowing regularity. According to the United Nations, 11,418 civilians were killed in the country last year -- the most since the U.N. started tallying casualties in 2009. Taliban insurgents now hold sway over vast stretches of territory - the most since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.

Islamic State militants also have established a foothold in the eastern province of Nangarhar. Last week a booby trap laid by the terror group killed an American soldier from Utah and injured 11 fellow troops.

While Trump inherited the chaos that is Afghanistan, it's his watch now. It's a relief to see him finally forging an Afghan strategy, because so much is at stake.

Allowing the Taliban, Islamic State and other groups to succeed there creates two perilous scenarios: It turns the country into a rogue state, and thus an ideal training ground for terrorists with designs on attacking targets in the U.S., Europe and beyond. And it supplies militant leaders fodder for their online propaganda to inspire new attacks by lone wolves or sleeper cells.

Left on its own, the fractured, inept Afghan government likely won't be able to turn the tide against the Taliban. The Afghan army needs a stronger boost from U.S. and NATO troops, who can help Kabul's military hurt the insurgency enough that Taliban leaders see the value in beginning peace talks. Those talks are the only way Kabul and Washington can break free from the quagmire the Afghan conflict has become.

Every president who faces deployment decisions knows the danger of sending more young men and women into war zones. But letting rogue groups dig deeper into Afghanistan is the greater long-range danger to America. Trump is correct to increase the U.S. role there.

His ""principled realism"" approach rejects hard and fast timelines and troop levels and recognizes and adapts to the conditions on the ground. Trump's strategy directly confronts the Taliban and terrorist organizations and calls on regional partners for enhanced cooperation.

An explicitly announced timeline for withdrawal without a concluded peace process would have catastrophic consequences, allowing the Taliban and other violent organizations to bide their time before unleashing yet another series of assaults on human rights and life; thus undermining the impressive gains Afghanistan has made towards democratic governance and an inclusive society.

After decades of playing the spoiled spoiler, Pakistan will now face intensified pressure by the U.S. to end its support of the Haqqani Network and Taliban leadership -- a decidedly welcome and necessary development. The signal that the U.S. would seek to engage India as a key economic development partner in Afghanistan, in tandem with the threat of withdrawal of billions of dollars of aid, will hopefully serve as the impetus for Islamabad to finally jettison the extremist elements that have, for far too long, sowed instability in its northwestern neighbor.

Trump rightly put the Afghan government on notice -- if the U.S. is going to continue to expend lives and treasure on Afghan soil, then the leadership in Kabul must do its part to increase the capacity of its security forces, expand the reach of its territorial control, increase implementation of basic services, eradicate the culture of corruption and ensure that it creates an inclusive political process. However, he also affirmed that the U.S. would utilize every implement in its foreign policy toolbox to facilitate sustainable stability in Afghanistan -- diplomatic, economic and military aid.

While the president asserted that the U.S. will not undertake further ""nation-building,"" American and international economic and capacity-building assistance has undeniably led to phenomenal strides in all facets of life, particularly for Afghan women and girls in their ability to overcome the gender inequality, discrimination and collective trauma systemic in Afghanistan after decades of conflict and Taliban rule. Girls have gone back to school. Women work as government ministers, judges, lawyers, soldiers, doctors and engineers. A new generation is being raised in a country that recognizes women's rights as human rights.

The U.S. has worked closely with the Afghan government to make these achievements come to fruition. If it now decides to turn its back on the initiatives that have given rise to these dramatic changes -- which address many of the social ills that have allowed radicalization to exist and expand in the first place -- it will significantly handicap the military engagement America has vowed to undertake in this revamped strategy. If the U.S. is to achieve ""victory"" against ""the terrorists,"" it must address the root causes away from the battlefield that give rise to terrorism.

To make this approach truly effective, the administration must resist the president's isolationist inclinations and pressure regional actors -- including Pakistan, Russia, China, Iran and the Gulf states -- to reject material, financial, technical and all forms of support to the Taliban and extremist entities operating within the national borders of Afghanistan.

In addition, the State Department must be populated with competent experts at its leadership posts in southeast Asia and funded enough to be able to effectively exercise its institutional expertise.

The Afghan government should be heartened that U.S. assistance will persist, despite the president's former campaign pledges. However, more details must be enumerated to truly determine whether or not this is simply a repackaging of previous administrations' policies, or an approach that has the power to turn the tide towards peace and stability.

After 16 years, outright ""victory"" and ""defeat"" have remained elusive. The U.S. must more clearly articulate what constitutes a ""win,"" and work closely with its NATO and regional allies, the Afghan government, and -- most importantly -- the Afghan people to ensure its definition aligns with their own.","[{'uri': 'manizha_naderi@thehill.com', 'name': 'Manizha Naderi', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri':

John Nicholson, top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said that success will be determined by conditions on the ground.

KABUL, Afghanistan - Days after President Donald Trump's announcement of a new strategy for Afghanistan, the top U.S. officials in Kabul said Thursday that a promised increase in U.S. military personnel and air power was underway in the country.

At a news conference in the Afghan capital, the military commander for U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, said that the influx of new troops -- mostly trainers for the Afghan security forces -- would continue over the next few months.

He did not provide details on the number of troops, and he emphasized that U.S. forces would remain in Afghanistan with no prestated timeline for withdrawal. Previous reports have suggested that the increase, which Trump has put in the hands of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former Marine general, would amount to the deployment of around 4,000 additional U.S. troops.

They would be joining a U.S. force that officially totals about 8,400, but that the Pentagon recently acknowledged to the Wall Street Journal is closer to 12,000. More than 4,000 troops from other NATO countries are also said to be in Afghanistan.

""There will be additional capabilities, some of that is already arriving,"" Nicholson said. ""But we are not going to talk about the specific numbers. We are not going to telegraph to the enemy what it is we are going to do and how we are going to influence the battlefield.""

Nicholson said that air support to the Afghan forces would also be ramping up. That support has already been extensive in a year of major territorial gains for the Taliban insurgency. The U.S. Air Force reported dropping about 1,250 bombs and other ordnance in the first seven months of this year, almost twice as many as in the same period last year.

At the same news conference, the top U.S. diplomat in Afghanistan, Hugo Llorens, said that the new commitment was a message to the Taliban that negotiation would be the only way out of the war.

""The Taliban has a choice: They can continue to kill fellow Afghans and terrorize communities in a conflict they have no possibility of winning,"" Llorens said. ""Or they can seek reconciliation and put an end to the war.""

Though Trump's Afghan strategy announcement came Monday, discussion within the administration and the Pentagon over the increase in troops had gone on for months before, including plans for how to deploy them.

On Thursday, Nicholson characterized the new strategy in Afghanistan as defining success by conditions on the ground and not ""arbitrary timelines."" And he described the Taliban as a criminal organization increasingly focused on its profit from the drug trade.

The Taliban reacted to the news conference in real time, with one Twitter account associated with the insurgents saying that the general ""describes Taliban as criminals & still wants Taliban to join his rotten political process.""

After nearly 16 years of war, the new troop commitment without deadlines is also a tacit U.S. commitment to a conflict that is not going well. Though U.S. officials insist that the Afghan forces must bear the brunt of the fighting, they also acknowledge a long road ahead for army and police forces that have lost men in record numbers.

The officials have also signaled frustration with the pace of reform in the national police forces, which are widely seen as unruly and corrupt despite years of international assistance and training.

Army Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan and the NATO Resolute Support Mission, was careful not to say whether the new ""capabilities"" included more troops, but Army Gen. Joseph Votel, Nicholson's superior as head of U.S. Central Command, said Tuesday that additional troops could be on the ground within days or weeks.

At a news conference in Kabul, Nicholson said ""There will be additional capabilities, some of that is already arriving, but we are not going to talk about the specific numbers,"" the New York Times reported.

Echoing what Trump said Monday in an address to the nation, Nicholson said ""We are not going to telegraph to the enemy what it is we are going to do and how we are going to influence the battlefield.""

In forceful terms, Nicholson, who has been lobbying for more troops since February, said that Trump's pledge to send more resources and put pressure on Pakistan meant that the U.S. will stay in the 16-year-old war until the Taliban agrees to lay down its arms and the Islamic State offshoot known as ISIS-K is destroyed.

The message to the Kabul government and the Afghan National Security Defense Forces was ""We are with you in this fight and we will stay with you."" Nicholson said.

""The United States and our NATO Allies and partners are with you. We stand with your security forces against terrorists and the enemies of Afghanistan,"" Nicholson said.

""Along with our Afghan partners, we will relentlessly pursue ISIS-K (Islamic State-Khorasan province) and annihilate them,"" Nicholson said. ""We will continue to crush the remnants of al Qaeda, and we will increase our pressure on all terrorist groups in Afghanistan.""

Nicholson said the Taliban should view Trump's renewed commitment as a guarantee that they cannot win on the battlefield by waiting for the U.S. to lose resolve.

He urged the Taliban to ""Stop fighting against your countrymen. Stop killing innocent civilians. Stop bringing hardship and misery to the Afghan people. Lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children,"" Nicholson said.

Nicholson also repeated some of the pledges that U.S. commanders have been making since U.S. troops entered the country in 2001 -- the Afghan security forces would become more professional, corruption would be curbed, and the government would be reformed.

The Taliban immediately rejected Nicholson's offer. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told The Associated Press that the group would ""not giving our guns to anyone and our Taliban are fighting until the last U.S. soldier is no longer here in Afghanistan.""

Afghanistan's New Unity Government (NUG) of President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah expressed relief at Trump's buildup which will add troops and keep the flow of U.S. support and aid coming that props up the failing economy.

In his own address to the nation Wednesday, Ghani said that ""After this (Trump's commitment), there is no timeline or time-based conditions -- the US will stay with the Afghan people to the end.""

However, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in Tweets that the new Trump strategy ""excludes bringing peace and prosperity to Afghanistan and is focused on more war and rivalry in the region.""

In the long deliberations on a new strategy, Trump acknowledged Monday night that ""my original instinct was to pull out"" and abandon the effort that has cost the U.S. nearly $1 trillion and the lives of more than 2,250 troops.

However, Trump said he had come to realize that a ""hasty withdrawal"" would allow Afghanistan to return to being a sanctuary for terrorists to plot attacks against the U.S. homeland and repeat the mistakes of the Obama administration in withdrawing from Iraq, resulting in the rise of ISIS.

""We cannot repeat in Afghanistan the mistakes our leaders made in Iraq,"" Trump said.

Currently, there are about 8,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, although defense officials told the Wall St. Journal earlier this week that the actual number on the ground was closer to 12,000 due to overlaps in troop rotations and the widespread use of troops on so-called ""temporary"" assignment. A similar situation exists in trying to determine the actual number of U.S. troops in the ground in Iraq and Syria.

Nicholson began asking in February for a ""few thousand"" more troops and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was believed to be considering deploying about 3,900. However, Mattis said earlier this week that there was a number ""I'm authorized to go up to"" but he would not give any figures until Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford presented him with detailed deployment plan.

In his speech, Trump said he was also counting on more support from NATO. ""We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy, with additional troops and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will,"" Trump said.

In a statement Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said ""NATO remains fully committed to Afghanistan and I am looking forward to discussing the way ahead with Secretary Mattis and our allies and international partners.""

However, it was unclear how much support NATO could and would offer, given the focus of the alliance on the Russian threat.

In addition to the U.S. forces, NATO and coalition partners have about 4,500 troops in Afghanistan. They are strictly limited to the train, advise and assist role, unlike the U.S. forces which also carry out counter-terror raids and airstrikes.

Some allies have already indicated that they are only prepared to make modest increases in their troop commitments.

Poland, which has 200 soldiers currently serving there, has said it intends to boost that number to 230. Britain has 585 troops in Afghanistan, and an additional 85 advisers have already been pledged.

""The U.S. commitment is very welcome,"" Michael Fallon, Britain's defense secretary, said in a statement Tuesday. ""It's in all our interests that Afghanistan becomes more prosperous and safer: That's why we announced our own troop increase back in June.""

However, Fallon did not indicate any plans to increase British forces beyond what it has already pledged.","[{'uri': 'richard_sisk@military.com', 'name': 'Richard Sisk', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_Support_Mission', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Resolute Support Mission'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Nicholson_Jr.', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'John W.

He took command in Afghanistan during the Obama administration, is on his fourth tour and even met his wife because of their shared interests in the country.

The general got most of what he had sought in the strategy announced by Mr. Trump: increases in American military trainers and air support in targeting the Taliban, without deadlines.

But Mr. Trump emphasized that he had been reluctantly persuaded to perpetuate the war, which he has described as a total disaster -- not exactly a vote of confidence in General Nicholson. ""My original instinct was to pull out,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And historically, I like following my instincts.""

Now, the task of ensuring that Mr. Trump's gamble does not blow up in his face falls on General Nicholson, making the tightrope he has been walking even more wobbly.

The general, who had pleaded with the Obama administration not to reduce his resources, got little attention from the Trump White House for months. And just a few weeks ago, word leaked that Mr. Trump had talked of firing him -- for little of his own doing. So while General Nicholson may be newly empowered, he has also been undermined in the eyes of his Afghan partners.

""I was not only surprised, I was shocked -- to me it showed how Washington was detached from reality of Afghanistan, the reality of the U.S. military,"" Amrullah Saleh, a former Afghan intelligence chief, said of Mr. Trump's talk of firing General Nicholson. He called the general ""a rare and exceptional personality -- he stands out.""

General Nicholson is now not only the American face of the war, but also the face of American continuity for an Afghan government dealing with a new administration in Washington. A new ambassador to Kabul has yet to be confirmed.

He has described himself as the product of the United States' post-Sept. 11 campaign in Afghanistan. In this country, more than anywhere else, personal relationships are crucial. Battles often turn as much on winning the trust and faith of local leaders as on driving out the Taliban.

""I have seen many American commanders here, but the combination of qualities that Nicholson brings -- as a professional general, as a leader who understands and is comfortable with the culture here -- is very rare,"" said retired Gen. Sher Mohammad Karimi, the former chief of the Afghan Army, who has known General Nicholson for a decade.

""I have watched him from when he was a colonel, to now that he is a general,"" General Karimi said. ""Even then, like he does now, he would meet elders in Khost and in Nangarhar, for lunch, for tea, for discussions.""

General Nicholson's three tours in Afghanistan before he arrived as commander gave him an extraordinary knowledge of the country. It took him from the east along the Pakistani borderlands to the Taliban hotbed in the south. At the peak of the American military surge, when President Barack Obama sharply escalated the number of troops, he served in Kabul as the deputy commanding general for operations.

Even when he was posted outside the country, his work was connected to Afghanistan. From 2009 to 2010, he was the director of the Pakistan and Afghan Coordination Cell at the Pentagon, allowing him to see how a victory in Afghanistan would be impossible if insurgents enjoyed sanctuaries across the border.

He fell in love with Norine MacDonald, a researcher who campaigned for licensing opium for medicine, after meeting her at an event on Afghanistan, and they got married.

She often accompanies him on provincial trips, an unusual sight not only for local Afghan leaders to see a battlefield commander with his wife, but also for young American soldiers.

By the time General Nicholson was chosen in March 2016 to lead the command in Afghanistan, after a stint as the commander of NATO's Allied Land Command in Turkey, the resources on the ground were depleted even as the Taliban's threat was growing to a point that they verged on overrunning cities.

Back at home, priorities had shifted to the fight against the Islamic State. The command staff in Kabul had been radically reduced, forcing him to juggle mundane tactical decisions as well as larger questions of the war's direction.

Much of his time since taking over the war effort has been spent between presidential reviews, essentially forcing him to put his head down and work quietly behind the scenes.

At first, he spent months trying to persuade President Obama to stop the further reduction of American forces and expand the authorities of the command by allowing them to go after the Taliban. Then, just as this year's fighting season was starting in Afghanistan, the Trump administration began another policy review.

The general assigned his staff to study other conflicts, including the FARC guerrilla war in Colombia and a Maoist insurgency in India, for clues that could help in a war where the United States was out of ideas. It was under his command that American forces dropped a MOAB, the biggest non-nuclear weapon in the United States military.

General Nicholson has also played the role of a diplomat, and not just because the American Embassy has lacked an ambassador since winter. Afghanistan's fractured politics has required constant hand holding to keep political fights from further undermining the country's security forces.

While his predecessors were largely focused on trying to manage a relationship with former President Hamid Karzai, who increasingly challenged the American military presence, General Nicholson has a comfortable partnership with President Ashraf Ghani and his coalition partner, Abdullah Abdullah.

But the partners lack strong political support in the face of growing opposition. So the American general has stepped in, taking helicopter rides to the villa of Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf, a firebrand former warlord, on the outskirts of Kabul, or having tea with other figures mobilizing against Mr. Ghani's government. An aide to Mr. Sayyaf said his boss often described the general as ""a good listener.""

""He understands he is operating in a fragmented society, and that the cohesion within the state is fragile,"" said Mr. Saleh, the former Afghan intelligence chief. ""The very fact that he is reaching out to various persons who matter in the political landscape shows his farsightedness.""

Much of the general's time also is spent on encouraging, and often pressuring, the Afghan forces to reform and do more of the fighting -- a must, if Mr. Trump's new strategy is to work and if he is to get value for his dollar.

Afghan and Western officials described General Nicholson as courteous and friendly in meetings -- often reminding the Afghans across the table of old battles they had fought together -- but also firm. He has withheld pay for tens of thousands suspected of being fictional ""ghost soldiers"" until proved otherwise, and has suspended fuel contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars because of fear of corruption.

How General Nicholson will fare under the Trump administration remains unclear. But an episode this year gave the general and his Afghan partners a taste of the president's unpredictability.

With Mr. Trump's review of the war well underway, General Nicholson visited Kandahar Province, the former epicenter of the Taliban insurgency, and assured local officials that the United States was committed to Afghanistan and Mr. Trump's yet-to-be announced strategy would show that.

But in the following months, as Mr. Trump took his time to decide, reports came out that not only had the president flirted with the idea of a complete withdrawal, but had also raised the possibility of dismissing General Nicholson -- before meeting him.

While the general's superiors, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, expressed full confidence in him, some damage from the seesaw messages had been done.

""He promised us the situation would not get worse, and the U.S. was here to stay,"" said Sayed Jan Khakrezwal, the chief of the Kandahar provincial council. ""Then after some days we heard in the media that Trump is firing General Nicholson.""","[{'uri': 'mujib_mashal@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Mujib Mashal', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri':

President Donald Trump outlined his strategy for the war in Afghanistan Monday night during a speech at Fort Meyer in Arlington, Virginia. The new direction would likely call for an increase of thousands of troops to assist and train Afghan forces. Trump also emphasized he would step away from ""nation building.""

The administration also plans to put more pressure on Pakistan to eradicate safe havens for terrorists, and the president indicated that India would assist in economic and development support.

Ending the 16-year conflict has eluded former presidents, and Trump has made it no secret that he considers the war too costly. He said his first instinct when considering what to do was to pull out. The war for some time has been described by numerous analysts as a stalemate with the Taliban continuing to grow stronger while rampant corruption continues to plague the Afghan government, hampering U.S. military initiatives.

Many experts and veterans contend that Trump's plans for the country remain much like those of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama: Strengthen the Afghan government forces on the battlefield in hopes a bloodied Taliban will come to the negotiating table to negotiate a political solution.

Here's what you need to know about the longest conflict in U.S. history:

--Soldiers are still deployed to the region - and still dying.

About 8,500 U.S. troops have remained in Afghanistan since Obama officially ended the combat mission there. There are also NATO troops that work with the U.S. military to train, advise and assist Afghan security forces, as well as U.S. Special Operations forces on a separate counterterrorism mission targeting al-Qaida and the Islamic State. If more troops deploy to the region, they would likely continue to help the Afghan military fight a resurgent Taliban with more air support and other resources.

Ten U.S. service members have been killed this year - three of whom died in June when an Afghan soldier opened fire on American troops battling the Islamic State in Nangahar province. The most recent death occurred last week when Staff Sgt. Aaron Butler, 27, was killed by an improvised explosive device.

--The U.S. has spent billions of dollars fighting the war.

More than $700 billion has been spent to fund reconstruction and war efforts in Afghanistan, and the troop increase will likely add billions of dollars more to the cost of the conflict. Military strategists predict direct U.S. spending could balloon up to $840 billion. Those costs also include spending on the treatment of veterans' medical and disability needs.

In some instances, the money American taxpayers contributed has been squandered. One infamous example includes a $6 million program designed to breed Italian and Afghan goats for better cashmere to improve the yield. The experiment failed when many of the goats became sick and died.

""I'm not sure flying Italian goats into Afghanistan was exactly what the founders had in mind when they created a standing army for the United States,"" said John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.

--Corruption in Afghanistan is a major obstacle.

Corruption remains a widespread problem in both the Afghan government and its armed forces. In March, more than 1,000 Afghan army service members were fired following corruption charges. A prominent Afghan general who was in charge of the restive Helmand province - a region where U.S. and Afghan soldiers have experienced some of the deadliest fighting - is also on trial on embezzlement and corruption charges.

President Ashraf Ghani and his attorney general have launched a campaign to target senior officials in an effort to boost public confidence in the government, but the president also has to address widespread joblessness and anxiety about security of the country.

--The Islamic State and the Taliban continue to launch major terrorist attacks.

The Taliban has recently been responsible for some of the country's deadliest attacks in years. More than 140 Afghan soldiers were killed or wounded in April when a group of insurgents dressed in army uniforms stormed a heavily fortified base, detonating suicide vests and throwing grenades. The assault rattled the country, which was already reeling from an Islamic State attack that killed dozens in one of the country's largest military hospitals. The attacks were major blows to the U.S. war effort to help the Afghan army become self-sustaining.

""My original instinct was to pull out -- and, historically, I like following my instincts,"" Trump told the nation in a prime-time address outlining his strategy for Afghanistan. But after studying the situation -- and weeks of dithering in the face of vicious infighting on the subject among his staff -- he came to understand why withdrawal wasn't wise: ""9/11, the worst terrorist attack in our history, was planned and directed from Afghanistan because that country was ruled by a government that gave comfort and shelter to terrorists.""

The course he chose is little different from the status quo, with one exception: The president called out one of Afghanistan's neighbors for providing protection to those destabilizing the country. ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,"" Trump noted. ""No partnership can survive a country's harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. service members and officials."" It was a direct rebuke to his predecessor, Barack Obama, who declared in his Afghanistan strategy speech that ""we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interests, mutual respect, and mutual trust."" Obama didn't mention Pakistan's neighbor and rival, but Trump did; working more with India, he said, was a ""critical part of the South Asia strategy.""

Trump rightly recognizes that to change the situation in Afghanistan, America must change its strategy in the broader region. But he only mentioned countries to Afghanistan's east and south. He said not a word about its direct western neighbor, which enjoys causing chaos in that country and beyond: Iran.

Trump noted that ""Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror."" The Islamic Republic does, too -- and much more. Iran sees itself killing two birds with one stone there. A permanently destabilized Afghanistan is easier to exert influence over, and through the Taliban, Iran can help hit what it calls the Great Satan: the United States. In a long report in its August 6 edition, ""Iran Flexes in Afghanistan As U.S. Presence Wanes,"" the New York Times detailed the ways Iran contributes to the terrorist cause. Some Taliban commandos live in Iran, moving back and forth across the border, and new fighters are recruited and trained there. Iran also gives Taliban terrorists direct aid: fuel, weapons, cash. As Afghan officials told the Times, ""Iran is set on undermining the Afghan government and its security forces, and the entire United States mission, and maintaining leverage over Afghanistan by making it weak and dependent.""

The details in the Times account were eye-opening, but its conclusions weren't a revelation. ""In the past several months, multiple U.S. commanders have warned of increased levels of assistance, and perhaps even material support, for the Taliban from Russia and Iran,"" the Congressional Research Service noted in an August 22 report. Weekly Standard contributing editor Thomas Joscelyn last year analyzed documents, including records from the State Department, Treasury, and a D.C. district court, and concluded, ""Iran has supported the Taliban's insurgency since late 2001.""

Some skeptics persist in claiming that Iran, a Shia state, wouldn't align itself with a Sunni fundamentalist group. Superficial students of the Middle East and environs think all alliances and enmities there are sectarian. But not every battle in the region sees Sunni pitted against Shia (think only of the recent diplomatic row between Qatar and a group of Arab Gulf states). Who can be surprised that a government that imprisons and tortures dissidents, encourages acid attacks on women who go unveiled, and bans social media is happy to back an organization that, when it was in power, outlawed music and movies, prevented girls from being educated, and gave safe haven to terrorists plotting attacks against the United States?

The Trump administration is reportedly close to finishing its review of U.S. policy toward Iran. The president has made it clear he would like to tear up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action signed by his predecessor, but he's twice bowed to pressure from advisers and recertified it. Here the author of The Art of the Deal should follow his instincts. The nuclear deal is providing the Islamic Republic with increased resources it's using to fund terrorism in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Iran received $1.7 billion from the United States through the agreement. ""None of that money reached the Iranian people,"" Farzad Madadzadeh, a 32-year-old dissident who fled Iran less than two years ago, told me recently. He was quick to name some of the people and groups who have benefited from the largesse: Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis. And more American money will be pouring into the country the State Department calls ""the foremost state sponsor of terrorism."" Boeing has signed two deals to supply Iran with aircraft, one for $16 billion, the other for $3 billion. By making those contracts possible, the JCPOA gives Iran the ability to do more harm to U.S. forces and interests in Afghanistan.

Will Trump ultimately overrule his viziers? One of them undermined the president just moments after his Afghanistan address. Trump said in his speech that someday ""perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan."" It was a strange statement, one that contradicted his declaration that ""it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future, to govern their society, and to achieve an everlasting peace."" Do the Afghan people want to be ruled by murderous fundamentalists who massacred civilians and brutally repressed women before they were replaced by the country's first elected government? They haven't indicated so at the ballot box; but then, a Taliban spokesman once stated, ""General elections are incompatible with sharia and therefore we reject them.""

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has admitted that he and the president ""have differences"" over the Iran nuclear deal. And not just there, it seems. Tillerson released a statement the night of Trump's address stating that the Taliban has a path to ""political legitimacy."" ""We stand ready to support peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban without preconditions,"" he said, adding that Pakistan ""can be an important partner in our shared goals of peace and stability in the region."" Trump's secretary of state is a lot more willing than his boss to make deals with terrorists and their supporters. Let's hope that this is one area in which the president is willing to recoup his authority.","[{'uri': 'kelly_jane_torrance@weeklystandard.com', 'name': 'Kelly Jane Torrance', 'type': 'author',

Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and the acting U.S. ambassador, Hugo Llorens, spoke about the importance of reaching a settlement with the Taliban in an attempt to end the nearly 16-year war.

Afghans see a peace pact as crucial to future stability, but Trump's Monday address seemed to dismiss an accord as a vague possibility. Both U.S. officials insisted that they were not breaking ranks with the White House, but framed their comments as additional details and reinforcement of Trump's message.

""We are determined to pursue the goal of a political settlement. As these terrorist groups realize that they cannot win, they will see that their best option is to pursue peace,"" Nicholson said.

[PRESIDENT TRUMP: Timeline, appointments, executive orders + guide to actions in first 200 days]

He invited the Taliban to ""stop bringing hardship and misery to the Afghan people. Lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children.""

Although Afghan officials immediately embraced Trump's message, many Afghan analysts and commentators expressed concern this week that it would be focused too narrowly on fighting the Taliban and terrorist groups. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai called it a formula based on ""killing, killing, killing.""

Many Afghans also expressed worries about Trump's declaration that the U.S. government would no longer pursue ""nation-building"" in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The United States has invested billions of dollars in aid, advisers and projects to help build Afghanistan's democracy and economy since the fall of the Taliban's regime in 2001.

Nicholson and Llorens -- after similar reassurances made by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington after Trump's speech -- emphasized that the new policy would be much more than a battle plan. Llorens said it would ""integrate all the instruments of American power,"" including diplomacy and economic support.

Llorens described a new ""compact"" between Washington and the Afghan National Unity government, which he said ""codifies"" a number of areas in which the two governments have agreed to cooperate, such as fighting corruption and promoting investment.

Nicholson, however, repeatedly returned to the theme of America's staunch military commitment to the war effort, vowing to pursue and ""annihilate"" Islamic State forces in Afghanistan and to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorists who ""wish to attack the rest of the world from Afghan soil.""

Like Trump, he declined to say how many additional U.S. troops would be sent. But he sought to counter critics that said the new military strategy would follow the same path as others that have failed to make significant headway in the conflict, even with more than 100,000 international troops in Afghanistan at one time.

One difference he cited was cooperation from the current Afghan government, which he called ""a trusted and willing partner"" that seeks to overhaul and professionalize the security forces. He also repeatedly praised the Afghan special operations forces, which are going to be doubled in size and trained by U.S. and NATO advisers.

""These brave soldiers have never lost a battle, and they never will,"" Nicholson said. ""With the additional support we will provide them, they will become larger and more lethal.""

Another change he mentioned was the shift from an American strategy of support based on ""arbitrary timelines"" to one ""guided by conditions on the ground.""

Trump did not specify those conditions, and many Afghans have asked this week what they would involve. Comments by Tillerson, followed by Llorens and Nicholson, suggested that progress on fighting corruption and holding elections could be key.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Executive order (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hamid Karzai'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'White House'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Political corruption'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Democracy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomacy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Special forces'}}]",,eng-3382459,0.06666666666666665,241346880,1,arkansasonline.com,news,ArkansasOnline,"Donald Trump Taliban United States Afghanistan Terrorism Kabul Demographics of Afghanistan Executive order (United States) Taliban insurgency Hamid Karzai President of Afghanistan White House Federal government of the United States Washington, D.C.

Trump's predecessors also tried to pressure Pakistan into taking a harder line on terrorist groups. But Islamabad's fears of India's influence in Afghanistan, coupled with the United States' need to avoid alienating a major non-NATO ally, have meant that the steps the United States has taken thus far have not yielded significant results.

Whether Trump fares better remains to be seen.

""I would say the rhetoric on Pakistan represents most the significant discontinuity"" from the Obama administration's Afghanistan strategy, said Joshua White, director for South Asian affairs in the Obama administration's National Security Council. ""But at this point Trump's talk about Afghanistan is merely suggestive. While it may presage tougher policies, it's not clear yet that the administration has the stomach for undertaking dramatic action with respect to Pakistan.""

The U.S. relationship with Pakistan has seen ups and downs over the course of the 16-year war in Afghanistan, with the tensest moment coming after U.S. special forces killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011.

The United States has three main requests for Pakistan, according to White: clearing tribal areas used by the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network, delegitimizing terrorist groups focused on attacking India and ending so-called ""vertical"" nuclear proliferation -- increasing Pakistan's own delivery systems and warheads.

Most consequential for the Afghanistan conflict is the failure to clear out the Haqqani network, considered the most lethal insurgent group fighting in Afghanistan.

""The Haqqani network represents the most significant force protection threat to the U.S. military anywhere in the world,"" White said.

Pakistan denies that it provides safe haven to terrorists, often pointing to the operation launched in 2014 to clear groups such as the Haqqanis from the Waziristan border region with Afghanistan. The operation was launched after the June 2014 attack on the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, which was claimed by the Pakistani Taliban and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.

""To scapegoat Pakistan will not help in stabilizing Afghanistan,"" the country's National Security Committee said in a statement Thursday after a meeting on Trump's Afghanistan strategy. ""On its own part, Pakistan has taken indiscriminate actions against all terrorist networks and sacrificed tens of thousands of troops and civilians in this fight.""

But experts say Pakistan does continue to provide the Taliban and the Haqqani network with refuge and support for two main reasons.

First and foremost in Pakistan's calculus is using the terrorist groups as a counter to archrival India. New Delhi is Afghanistan's biggest regional donor, giving more than $3 billion in assistance since 2001 and building the country's new parliament building, hydropower plants, dams and 2,500 miles of road.

""The elephant in the room is the India-Pakistan relationship,"" said Moeed Yusuf, associate vice president of the Asia Center at the U.S. Institute of Peace. ""India-Pakistan relations are only thing that Pakistan really cares about in terms of changing its behavior.""

In Pakistan's mind, according to Yusuf, the Taliban is its best ally for countering Indian influence in Afghanistan.

The second main reason for Pakistan's behavior, experts say, is that it is hedging its bets should the United States withdraw from Afghanistan, the current government collapse and the Taliban come back into power.

The Taliban and the Haqqani network ""are the people who can guarantee them at least a sphere of influence in Afghanistan if things fell apart there,"" said Marvin Weinbaum, director for Pakistan studies at the Middle East Institute and former analyst for Pakistan and Afghanistan in the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research.

U.S. options for pressuring Pakistan include curtailing or conditioning aid, sanctioning Pakistani officials, stepping up drone strikes inside the country, taking away its status as a major non-NATO ally or even naming it as a state sponsor of terrorism.

""All of those things you just listed are on the table for discussion if, in fact, they are unwilling to change their posture or change their approach to how they're dealing with the numerous terrorist organizations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan,"" Secretary of State Rex TillersonRex Wayne TillersonOPINION | There is no Trump administration Why the next Fed chief will be a Republican who loves low rates Why this US-North Korea standoff is different MORE told reporters Tuesday.

The United States has put conditions on aid to Pakistan. Former President Obama's last Defense secretary, Ash Carter, withheld $300 million meant for Pakistan for fiscal 2016 over insufficient action against the Haqqani network.

Defense Secretary James MattisJames Norman MattisTrump to tackle Afghanistan strategy at Camp David Four members of Joint Chiefs denounce racism US, Japan conduct air drills after North Korea issues Guam warning MORE decided last month to withhold the remaining $50 million for that fiscal year for the same reason.

But there are a number of factors keeping the United States from acting more aggressively against Pakistan.

For one, U.S. forces rely on Pakistani ports and roads to resupply troops in landlocked Afghanistan. Pakistan could respond to increased U.S. pressure by cutting off access to those routes.

""They've got a chokehold on us,"" Weinbaum said.

Another reason is that Pakistan's concerns about India are so ingrained in the country's security planning, nothing but drastic action could change its mind, experts say.

Yusuf said he does not see U.S. efforts on Pakistan working unless ""there is a decision in Washington that it doesn't matter if there's a rupture"" in the region.

Still, until the Trump administration specifies the new steps it will take against Pakistan, experts say it's unclear how effective the effort will be.

""The reaction in Pakistan was much more a sense of eye-rolling than fear,"" Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Wilson Center's Asia program, said of the reaction the Trump's speech. ""The proof is in the details. Will Trump actually be willing to take more hard-line steps than before?""","[{'uri': 'rebecca_kheel@thehill.com', 'name': 'Rebecca Kheel', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri':

(Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)

The Post reports:

Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and the senior U.S. Embassy official, special charge d'affairs Hugo Llorens, spoke at a joint news conference about the importance of reaching a settlement with the Taliban in an attempt to end the nearly 16-year war.

In an address Monday, Trump focused on ""winning"" the war and depicted an accord as a remote possibility. Both U.S. officials were careful to avoid contradicting the president, framing their comments as additional ""details"" and reinforcement of his message.

""We are determined to pursue the goal of a political settlement. As these terrorist groups realize that they cannot win, they will see that their best option is to pursue peace,"" Nicholson said. He invited the Taliban to ""lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children.""

While Trump disparaged ""nation-building,"" the generals recognized that political and economic reform is as important as military success. (""Llorens said it would 'integrate all the instruments of American power,' including diplomacy and economic support."")

In essence, Trump's rhetoric is a less reliable barometer of what we are actually trying to accomplish in Afghanistan.

Back from a recent trip there, Max Boot explains:

[A]ll the briefings I received from American officials were about nation-building. Admittedly, no one used that term -- the preferred euphemisms are ""capacity building,"" ""enabling"" and ""working by, through and with."" But the intent is the same: to create Afghan government institutions that can overcome the threats from the Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and other Islamist terrorist groups active in that country.

The United States really has no alternatives. It is willing neither to abandon Afghanistan, that way allowing it once again to become a safe haven for transnational terrorists, nor to put the entire combat mission on the backs of United States forces, an effort that would call for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops.

So, contrary to Trump's remarks, we aren't aiming for a military victory, we are nation-building and our policy is much more similar to that of his predecessors than it is different (absent a clear improvement, namely no fixed timetables). It's not clear whether the speech was an attempt by the military triumvirate (Defense Secretary James Mattis, NSA Director H.R. McMaster and chief of staff John Kelly) to convince Trump he's aiming for a ""win"" or to convince America we can still ""win."" Perhaps it is some of both. The downside of taking Trump ""seriously but not literally"" in this context is clear. This is a democracy, and leaders have an obligation to be transparent with voters so they can be held accountable for their actions. As a practical matter, it's never wise to set up voters for a surprise, namely an eventual end to fighting that leaves the Taliban in some sort of power-sharing arrangement. In other words, it would be nice if our leaders had enough confidence in themselves and faith in the American people to just tell it like it is.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Mnuchin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Steven Mnuchin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Attorney General'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-building', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Nation-building'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of the Treasury'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sessions', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Jeff Sessions'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Associated Press'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States,_Kabul', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Embassy of the United States, Kabul'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Nicholson_Jr.', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'John W.

Story highlightsIn the same province, 26 Afghan soldiers were killed last week in a Taliban attackA blast there in January killed 11 people

(CNN)An attack on a NATO mission convoy in Afghanistan has resulted in the death of two US service members, the Pentagon said Wednesday.

""Two US service members were killed in action in Kandahar, Afghanistan, when their convoy came under attack"" on Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said in a statement.Earlier Wednesday, the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission, which trains and advises Afghanistan's military and police, confirmed that the attack had resulted in casualties.""Resolute Support can confirm a NATO convoy was attacked this afternoon in Kandahar. The attack did cause casualties,"" the statement said.The high-profile attack targeting the coalition comes as President Donald Trump's administration is attempting to determine its commitment to and strategy for Afghanistan and the wider region and could be seen as an attempt to shape that debate.Read MoreSecretary of Defense James Mattis told Congress that the strategy would be decided upon by mid-July but has since said that the administration is continuing to work on it.In the absence of an administration policy on Afghanistan Sen. John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Monday he would work to produce a strategy for winning the conflict in September.""Eight years of a 'don't lose' strategy has cost us lives and treasure in Afghanistan. Our troops deserve better,"" McCain said in a statement.US and coalition casualties in Afghanistan have become rarer in recent years, falling dramatically since the Afghan government assumed responsibility for combat operations in 2014. But there has been an uptick in recent months as US forces have become more directly involved in the fight against the local ISIS affiliate.Wednesday's bombing is the latest attack to rock southern Kandahar province, which borders Pakistan, in recent months.At least 26 Afghan soldiers were killed and 13 more wounded last week in a Taliban attack on an army camp in the province's Khakrez district, the Afghan Ministry of Defense said.An explosion in January at a provincial government compound killed at least 11 people, including Kandahar's deputy governor, and injured 14 more, authorities said. Five Emirati humanitarian workers were among those killed, and the Emirati ambassador to Afghanistan was injured.Violence also continues elsewhere in the country.At least 29 people were killed and dozens more injured Tuesday in a suicide attack during evening prayers at a Shiite mosque in Herat city, western Afghanistan.A day earlier, two Afghan workers for the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul, the Afghan capital, were killed after gunmen launched an attack.

When Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. met Rep. C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger at a spartan military post in Afghanistan last year, they ran through the list: Ravens, Orioles and people they knew in common.

""We just talked local for a while,"" Ruppersberger said.

Then they turned to business. Ruppersberger was there to be briefed by Nicholson, a 1975 graduate of Gilman School who grew up in the Towson area and is now the top NATO and U.S. military officer in Afghanistan. It's a role he's held since early last year, but it took on new prominence this week as President Donald Trump outlined his plans to revamp the nation's strategy there and send thousands more troops to help.

Nicholson was not available for an interview with The Baltimore Sun, but he told reporters in Kabul this week that some of those forces had already begun arriving and that Trump's policy of a seemingly open-ended commitment to Afghanistan would ultimately force the Taliban to make a deal.

""With the announcement of this policy, the Taliban cannot win on the battlefield,"" he said. ""It is time for them to join the peace process.""

Schoolmates of Nicholson's from Gilman -- who knew him as Nick, a moniker that has morphed into Mick over the years -- say they're not surprised he's risen so high in the military. But former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., his football teammate, said he was in many ways a regular student even though, like Nicholson, his father was a West Point graduate who went on to become a brigadier general.

""It wasn't all about the military or his dad or 'I'm going to West Point and I want to be a general,' "" Ehrlich said. ""He was a good student, you knew he was going to be successful. ... He had his act together at a very early stage.""

Ehrlich said Nicholson wasn't a big guy on the football field but rather ""thin and tough"" and ""a very strong competitor.""

Alongside achievements on the athletic field, Nicholson's Gilman yearbook page shows him sporting longish hair and includes shout-outs to rockers Black Sabbath and Mick Jagger. Unusually, he holds degrees from both Georgetown University and West Point, and didn't receive his first military assignment, with the 82nd Airborne Division, until 1983.

That was in time for the American invasion of Grenada, where he earned a Bronze Star for valor, and began his climb through the military ranks.

Since the Sept. 11 terror attacks -- in which he reportedly narrowly avoided being killed when his Pentagon office was destroyed -- Nicholson has spent much of his time supporting the Afghan campaign at the Pentagon and NATO or leading troops in the field. He is said to have more experience in the country than any other senior American military officer.

Nicholson told senators during his confirmation hearing last year that the nation's 16-year war in Afghanistan ""has largely defined my service.""

He took command as head of NATO's Resolute Support mission and American forces in Afghanistan in March 2016, as the Obama administration planned a final few months of fighting before ultimately pulling out in January. But before Nicholson even departed Washington, it was clear some on Capitol Hill had misgivings about that plan, and he pledged to review troop levels and come back with recommendations. This February, he told Congress the fighting had reached a stalemate and that he needed thousands more troops on top of the 10,000 or so Americans already there to carry out his mission.

Thomas Spoehr, a retired Army lieutenant general, said that admission took courage because senior officers are sometimes not willing to be candid when their efforts aren't going well.

""I give him respect and credit,"" Spoehr said.

At one point, it looked as though Nicholson's command might end early after reports that Trump was upset with his leadership. But Defense Secretary James Mattis publicly offered his support for Nicholson, and following Trump's announcement, Nicholson appears set to get the additional forces he wanted. Spoehr said the White House will likely give him greater flexibility to shape the mission.

""The authority of the commanding general there is probably increasing,"" said Spoehr, now the director of the Center for National Defense at the Heritage Foundation. ""During the final years of the Obama administration, their latitude was restricted.""

Yet despite Trump's prime-time speech and pledge to abandon nation-building, the new strategy appears to mostly be a modified version of the old one. It will still focus on training and aiding the Afghan military, which is doing the frontline fighting against the Taliban, and seeking to prevent al-Qaida and the Islamic State terror groups from using Afghanistan as a base to plot against the United States.

An Afghan television reporter asked Nicholson this week why Afghans should expect anything to be different, but the general sounded upbeat, saying the new plan meant the United States was ready to wait until peace could be achieved, rather than setting a deadline to pull out.

""So this is why I would say to the Afghan people that they can believe this will be different, because we have removed the calendar from the equation,"" he said.

Throughout his rise in the military, Nicholson has stayed in touch with old friends from Baltimore, some of whom went to the ceremonies at Fort Bragg, N.C., when he took command of the 82nd Airborne and attended his 2013 wedding at West Point to security analyst Norine MacDonald. Ehrlich said he's hosted him at his home in recent years and they have one of those friendships where meeting up even after years feels like picking up right where you left off.

And, according to a report in the Gilman Bulletin, he was a star attraction at the class's 35th reunion in 2010, where Nicholson outlined a strategy of putting pressure on the Taliban to force them to negotiate that is almost identical to the current plan.

He also took a dig at officers assigned to run the higher profile campaign in Iraq, deriding them for living in palaces while commanders in Afghanistan made do in tougher conditions, and described coming under fire even as a general.

Yet he was still their old school pal, according to the school magazine: ""Nick looks happy and relaxed, evidently digging being dropped back behind Gilman lines.""

At this time, 8,400 U.S. troops are present in Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pakistan has said that Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua met with Afghanistan's vice foreign minister, Nasir Andisha, currently on a visit to Islamabad. Promotion of cooperation between the two countries in different areas, as well as the establishment of lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan, were discussed in the meeting. Both leaders were in agreement on this point that terrorism is the common enemy of both Pakistan and Afghanistan and their people.

What the Trump administration calls its Afghan military strategy is actually India's line. The current administration is very much under India's influence, which is evident in the deep similarity in the reactions of India and the U.S. to terrorism events. Indian influence over American policies can also be seen here in the fact that the U.S. has declared the well-known freedom-loving organization, Hizbul Mujahideen, along with its leader Syed Salahuddin, to be a terrorist organization, at India's request. As long as the Trump administration fails to base its strategy on objective research of the region, Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot be rid of terrorism.

In consideration of its position as the world's lone superpower, America's highest priority should be the establishment of peace in the world. But its biased policies that are not based on reality have created difficulties for Palestinians and Kashmiris fighting for their freedom, and for Pakistan, engaged in fighting against terrorism.

Following the destruction of the twin towers, America's craving for revenge has resulted in subjecting a large part of the world's population to the menace of terrorism. Pakistan had no connection to the destruction of the twin towers. There was no Pakistani or Afghan among those who drove the plane into the twin towers. Yet the U.S. destroyed and ruined Afghanistan. The terrorism that was created as a result claimed more than 60,000 lives in Pakistan. The loss to the country's economy exceeded $1 billion.

The only way to be free of America's destructive policies is for Pakistan and Afghanistan to develop a joint strategy against their common enemy, terrorism, without the influence of any third country. During the time of Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's perverse attitude toward Pakistan served to promote terrorism. The initial attitude of Ashraf Ghani raised the hope that this policy would change. But, unfortunately, that did not prove to be the case. The only solution for overcoming the difficult situation being faced by Afghanistan and Pakistan lies in deep cooperation and mutual trust between the two countries.

As far as the new military strategy of the U.S. relating to Afghanistan is concerned, even that will not solve the problem. The problem cannot be solved by military strength; rather, the only way to solve it is through talks and discussions with different Taliban groups, particularly those who are opposed to terrorism, and by including them in the peace process.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hizbul_Mujahideen', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hizbul Mujahideen'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Affairs', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Palestinians'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiris', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kashmiris'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Hamid Karzai'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Superpower'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_peace_process', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Israeli–Palestinian peace process'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}]",,eng-3382459,-0.2235294117647059,241393740,1,watchingamerica.com,news,Watching America,Presidency of Donald Trump Terrorism Pakistan India Afghanistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan) Hizbul Mujahideen Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Foreign minister Islamabad Ashraf Ghani Palestinians Kashmiris Hamid Karzai Superpower Israeli–Palestinian peace process Taliban,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,49,21,2017-08-25

In announcing his strategy, Trump portrayed a break from his predecessor, Barack Obama. But in substance, the new strategy looks remarkably similar to the old one. More soldiers will be deployed to train Afghan forces, and diplomatic pressure might again be applied to neighboring Pakistan because it harbors terrorists -- with the twist of getting help from India, which angers Pakistan.

Trump did not specify how many troops will be deployed, how long they would serve, or what would constitute success in the region. Instead, he simply said the surge would not be a ""blank check"" for American involvement.

News reports suggest as many as 4,000 additional troops could join the 8,400 Americans already in Afghanistan.

Trump's rationale for the surge, despite his initial instinct to withdraw our troops, is to stabilize the region and limit terrorism.

We understand the rationale, but there is still that same sense of open-endedness that were the hallmarks of the previous two administrations.

Americans are rightfully weary of our prolonged involvement in Afghanistan. The war has spanned 16 years and three presidencies. Thousands of American troops have been killed. Yet we have little to show for this sacrifice. When America has reduced troop levels, the Taliban has gained ground. The Afghan government remains weak and corrupt. Pakistan remains a haven for terrorists (remember, Osama bin Laden was living there).

Most military and Afghanistan experts have said this modest troop surge could stabilize the region in the near term, but it won't change the game. When the United States deployed 100,000 soldiers to Afghanistan under Obama, the Taliban was not compelled to negotiate a peace agreement. Why would 4,000 more troops suddenly inspire diplomacy?

This speaks to the quagmire of Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, analysts expect the CIA to step up its covert counterterrorism campaign there, but the role of diplomacy remains unclear. The State Department has closed the office of its special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan.

There are short-term merits to this troop surge, but without any compelling diplomacy to engage the Taliban, Afghanistan remains a long-term quagmire. At some point, America will have to withdraw from Afghanistan. At some point, the Afghan people will have to resolve their own problems. This ""new"" strategy does not seem to envision this.","[{'uri': 'express_news_editorial_board@mysanantonio.com', 'name': 'Express-News Editorial Board', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_treaty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Peace treaty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Central Intelligence Agency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Osama bin Laden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Department of State'}}]",http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/65/02/06/13902240/3/rawImage.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.05098039215686279,241395300,1,mysanantonio.com,news,mySA,Donald Trump Pakistan Afghanistan Terrorism Afghan Armed Forces Barack Obama Peace treaty Politics of Afghanistan Taliban Counter-terrorism Central Intelligence Agency Osama bin Laden Demographics of Afghanistan United States Department of State,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,15,22,2017-08-25

By Josh Smith

BAGRAM AIRFIELD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - For the fighter pilots at the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan, President Donald Trump's new strategy for the war should mean escalating an already surging air campaign, and possibly including an unrestrained offensive against the Taliban.

The number of U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan has already dramatically spiked since Trump took office in January, from 1,074 in all of last year to 2,244 as of August 20 this year.

After a months-long review of his Afghanistan policy, Trump committed the United States last week to an open-ended conflict in the country and promised a stepped-up campaign against the Taliban insurgents.

Few details have emerged, but the pilots in Bagram are preparing for the possibility they'll be taking the fight to the Taliban in a way they haven't since the U.S.-led ""combat mission"" in Afghanistan was called off at the end of 2014.

Among their targets since then have been Islamic State militants, who are also active in the country.

""Between the two groups, the Taliban are definitely smarter,"" F-16 pilot Maj. Daniel Lindsey told Reuters. ""The Taliban are much harder to kill.""

While Islamic State has launched a series of deadly attacks around the country, it has nowhere near the influence, reach, and community ties that the Taliban has.

It's those factors that pilots say make the Taliban a more challenging target, and one that has outlasted years of heavy bombardment.

""The Taliban is often embedded in the community, but nobody likes the Islamic State, so they are often separate,"" Lindsey said.

NEW PARAMETERS

In many ways, Trump's policy is less a new plan than the continuation of a slow slide back into combat for American troops, although officials are quick to say their mission will remain focused on training and advising Afghan forces.

On Thursday, the commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, confirmed that his forces would increase air support for Afghan troops.

""We know the enemy fears air power,"" he told reporters in Kabul.

White House officials have said that rolling back territorial gains by the Taliban will be one of the key objectives of the new strategy.

For a time after former president Barack Obama declared America's combat mission over in Afghanistan at the end of 2014, U.S. forces were restricted from attacking the Taliban in most circumstances except self-defense.

As the group expanded its hold in Afghanistan, however, Obama began to loosen some of those rules and Trump has gone further in sending U.S. troops back into battle with their old adversaries.

Asked about the recent effects of U.S. air strikes, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the group's fighters had become used to dodging American bombs.

""In 2010, 2011 and 2012 the U.S. air strikes were successful and we lost many Mujahedeen,"" he told Reuters. ""But now we have enough experience to avoid casualties during their strikes by hiding in mountain holes and other places.""

Still, forcing the Taliban to hide and preventing them from massing fighters has in some cases been credited with helping Afghan security forces hold on to some cities and blunt Taliban offensives.

Trump also announced that he would ""lift restrictions and expand authorities in the field,"" but it remains unclear exactly what that would entail.

A U.S. military spokesman in Kabul, Capt. William Salvin, said U.S. forces are still limited to conducting air strikes in three broad circumstances: self-defense, counter-terrorism strikes against specific groups, and helping Afghan troops achieve ""strategic effects.""

He declined to say whether those parameters might change.

The U.S. military does not publicize its rules of engagement, but Lindsey said compared to when he was a fighter pilot at the height of the troop surge in Iraq in 2007, the so-called ""ROE"" in Afghanistan were less restrictive.

""Some guys can complain about it, but most I know don't seem to have any problem finding Islamic State or Taliban to kill,"" he said. ""If you use the rules smartly, you'll get the bad guys.""

The surge in air strikes has led the U.S. Air Force units at Bagram to increase their maintenance and intelligence efforts, said F-16 pilot Maj. Abraham Lehman.

Officials say ramping up the number of strikes further would require the deployment of more support staff as well as additional specialized troops on the ground to coordinate the strikes.

While he said he had no information on new plans to deploy additional aircraft, Lehman said it ""made sense"" to increase air support as the Pentagon sends thousands more troops to the country.

""What we do is always a joint effort between us and the ground troops,"" Lehman said.

Crowley is former assistant secretary of state and author of ""Red Line: American Foreign Policy in a Time of Fractured Politics and Failing States.""

For the most part, President Trump's speech laying out his strategy in Afghanistan earlier this week focused on policy and not politics, reaffirming America's interest in preventing that country from again becoming a haven for terrorists. Despite his instincts to withdraw all remaining forces, a step that President Barack Obama also contemplated, Trump likewise decided the troops would remain.

But foreign policy is not immune to domestic politics. The president, in a gesture to his base, did fall back to a campaign pledge at one point in the speech:

""We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live or how to govern their own complex society,"" Trump said. ""We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.""

""Nation-building"" has become something of a lightning rod in foreign policy for both parties. Obama often said that ""nation-building begins at home."" There is not a great rhetorical distance from that narrative to ""Make America Great Again.""

In reality, nation-building is the only strategy that is likely to produce the elusive exit from Afghanistan that American leaders have sought since 2001. The clearest path to success -- even if it takes far longer than anticipated -- is continuing to build the capabilities of the Afghan government.

Trump spoke of an integrated strategy in his speech, but there is no development surge included in that plan. In fact, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Trump administration, which has advocated deep cuts in the budgets of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, will actually spend less in Afghanistan going forward.

Instead, Trump spoke only of a military victory, signaling (without specifically announcing) a modest increase in troop levels and more aggressive rules of engagement. This renewed commitment sends the right signal. U.S. forces will still be there when his presidency ends.

But Trump has oversimplified the mission as killing more terrorists. The United States and its NATO allies have been doing that for 16 years, expecting battlefield success to generate a political settlement. All corners turned have led to stalemate, and no viable negotiations are in sight.

The actual U.S. exit strategy is not the defeat of the Taliban and its allies; it is the formation of an Afghan government strong enough to defend itself from insurgent groups and meddling neighbors. This is something Afghanistan, supported by the United States, would have to achieve through political negotiations -- should they ever get off the ground.

It remains unclear whether the Taliban wants to negotiate. As such, creating leverage on the Taliban to negotiate is vital. Trump rightly called out Pakistan for playing a duplicitous role in Afghanistan and called on India to take on a greater role in the conflict. But while Trump threatened to withhold aid to Pakistan, again quite appropriately, Pakistan could retaliate by halting the resupply of U.S. forces through its ports. Meanwhile, increased Indian influence would likely generate counterproductive impulses from Pakistan as well.

Afghanistan has been called ""The Great Game"" for good reason. Russia and Iran have a stake as well. They played a constructive role in Afghanistan in 2001. They aren't now. Trump's regional approach is unlikely to gain traction if key neighbors are excluded from the process. (Who knew foreign policy could be so complicated?)

If the president truly wants to win, the Afghan government needs to be able to retake territory from the Taliban, hold it and govern it adequately; develop a more modern culture whereby Afghanistan invests in all its people, not half; build an economy based on legitimate enterprise, not narcotics; and connect Afghanistan to the rest of the region, making the country more sovereign and less the subject of geopolitical games.

Whatever you want to call it, it's nation-building. This is not about charity. It's about strategy. If the days of nation-building in Afghanistan are over, then the president lacks a path to success in Afghanistan.

Members of the 2nd Battalion 502nd Infantry speak about the war. Lacy Atkins / The Tennessean

CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE

Joe Oleniczak Sr. sees a lot of himself in President Donald Trump, and is confident in the president's ""path forward"" in the nation's longest war ever.

""I feel that President Trump has put together an excellent (probably the best) team to address the military situation,"" Oleniczak Sr. said in a letter to USA TODAY Network - Tennessee. ""By doing this he has put the ""experts of protecting America"" in charge.""

Oleniczak lives in Centerville, in rural Tennessee, and is the father of Air Force Master Sgt. Joe Oleniczak, Jr. The pair became reknown this week when the father's letter to his son during the war was read in a White House briefing.

Trump's strategy for Afghanistan has mixed reviews, and questions from Republican lawmakers.

Trump's plan has no timetable for withdrawal, no cost projection and no clear indication of how many extra American troops like Oleniczak will be sent to train Afghan forces to fight for themselves.

But Oleniczak lauded Trump's team, which includes Defense Secretary James Mattis, to whom Trump has delegated almost all decisions about Afghanistan.

""They are the octane this fight needs right now,"" Oleniczak Jr. said.

Others, though, are less confident in the plan, saying it will continue the current ""stalemate,"" a term used by Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

Rebecca Zimmerman, a policy researcher for the Rand Corp., spent years in Afghanistan studying strategy.

She said Trump's new focus on ISIS-Khorasan is a deviation from past strategies, noting it contradicts what others in the administration have suggested to ""buy space for peace with the Taliban.

Analysis: Trump's strategy in Afghanistan lacks winning options

""I find it distressing to place so much emphasis on a group, ISIS-K, that is not an existential threat to the U.S. or Afghanistan,"" Zimmerman said.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the goal is to negotiate with Taliban.

But Oleniczak, who's witnessed brutal attacks on troops and civilians by the Taliban, doesn't endorse that.

""I don't know how you can trust or negotiate with somebody like that,"" he said.

Closer to home

At Fort Campbell, one of the largest military installations in the country, the soldiers are preparing for their next mission, which may mean bolstering the 8,400 troops in Afghanistan.

""Right now, we don't (know what the next mission will be),"" said Adam M. Sawyer, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team.

The battalion is one of dozens of military units that have been in near constant states of training and preparation for their next ""rendezvous with destiny,"" the unofficial slogan of the 101st and a common quip at Fort Campbell.

Current soldiers and veterans are cautious about discussing Afghanistan, but confident the 101st will perform as it has for ages, regardless of duration or nature of the mission.

More: With Trump's Afghanistan strategy murky, experts divided on future

""I don't know what direction (the war is headed), but the 101st will be around forever,"" he said.

Beside him, Randolph Worrell, of North Carolina, says the division will ""carry the torch like they're already doing.""

Dale S. Kirby, a retired teacher and Vietnam veteran from Cottontown, winced on Wednesday when asked about the decisions the Trump administration had laid out.

""It's so up in the air, a lot of us Vietnam veterans got really sad (when the U.S. first invaded Afghanistan),"" he said. The war in Afghanistan is the only other American conflict with a comparable time frame to Vietnam.

Fellow 2-502 member Roy Leo Hill of Rockhold, Ky., said he hopes there will be another way other than creating an opportunity where more names might be permanently chiseled on a battalion monument.

""They should find a way to not (fight war),"" Hill said. ""I hope someday we advance enough we can do that.""

The new policy moved beyond specifying future U.S. troop numbers to defining a larger strategic end state in Afghanistan.

It drew a clear distinction between America's friends and foes and sent the right message to the Taliban and their patrons that U.S. commitment to Afghanistan is unwavering and that we will no longer telegraph our exit with artificial deadlines.

Many have criticized the new policy as a status quo, but it was welcomed in Kabul. Afghan leaders have applauded the U.S. shift from a calendar-based approach to one based on conditions on the ground, although those conditions need to be properly defined to ensure the United States does not sign on to a forever war.

For years, Pakistan has pressed the Afghan government to reach a political settlement with the Taliban, which is Islamabad's preferred option, but has refused to allow the Taliban leaders to engage in negotiations with Afghanistan, especially when Pakistan's needs were unmet. In his speech, Trump urged the Taliban to engage in peace talks, but he was right to not give up U.S. military efforts against the group that would eventually force them into the negotiating table.

However, this will not happen without Pakistan's cooperation. The challenge is that there are multiple competing voices among those who run Pakistan's Afghan policy about what accommodation they expect in a political deal for them to relinquish the Taliban. On the one hand, there are elements within Pakistan's security hierarchy that relish chaos in Afghanistan, which they can manage over a noncompliant regime in Kabul.

These forces view destruction as power and leverage and use terrorism as a tool to create disorder. This has emboldened the Taliban, who are energized by their territorial gains in Afghanistan and believe that time is on their side.

On the other hand, there are also elements in Pakistan that are fretful about the infusion of radicalism into the ranks of its powerful military. For instance, radical Islamic ideals that appeal to unemployed youth are now also affecting lower- to mid-level members of Pakistan's military.

Although this blowback effect has not yet been morphed into tangible threats within the army, Pakistan's military realizes that if this trend continues, it will most likely create subversive insiders in the army that will threaten its stability from within. Unfortunately, these minority voices go unnoticed and their concerns often receive scant attention.

Meanwhile, the Taliban has not publicly sought a political deal, and they are unlikely to sue for peace. A cursory look at past peace efforts shows that each of them failed either because of bad faith, miscalculation, bad timing or they were torpedoed by Pakistan. There is another problem: The Taliban has no single pro-peace voice or a messenger who could authoritatively speak for the group to negotiate peace.

There is also no Taliban leader who can coalesce the entire group around a political deal and deliver on it. Nor would any Taliban leader freely engage with the Afghan government without Pakistan's consent.

How Pakistan's policy unfolds in response to the new U.S. policy remains to be seen, but there are reasons to believe that any shift in Pakistan's policy would be short-term and tactical. First, several of Pakistan's political parties are supporting radicalization and flirting with jihadi mindsets, including calling for a jihad against the United States in Afghanistan.

Even Imran Khan, the leader of Pakistan's main opposition party, has said that the Taliban are fighting a ""jihad"" in Afghanistan that is justified by Islamic law. Khan's recent response to the new Afghan policy was that it was the outcome of the ""Indian and Jewish lobby."" Such public condoning of terrorist activities inspires violent ideologies and provides a space for insurgents to recruit.

The underlying thinking in Islamabad may well be that it can still achieve its traditional goals through different means, perhaps even by creating another proxy group. Even if Islamabad changes its posture towards the Taliban, the distasteful history of Afghan-Pakistan relations would likely hamper the policy shift. There would also be no positive change in Pakistan's strategy unless it genuinely supports political inclusivity in Afghanistan.

Second, the mainstream media in Pakistan, rather than being a force broadly supportive of Afghanistan's stability, often does the opposite. A broad cross-section of Pakistani media (social and print) frequently claim that America has failed in Afghanistan and that it should pull out. Elements in the Pakistani media are also stoking paranoia and anti-Americanism among the people, while openly advocating on behalf of the Afghan insurgency.

Under such conditions, the mini-surge of 3,900 additional U.S. troops would be crucial in tilting the Afghan stalemate in favor of the Afghan government and would help boost the offensive capabilities of Afghan forces. This would include doubling the size of Afghan special forces to 30,000 soldiers, bolstering the Afghan air force and improving the leadership and intelligence collection capabilities of Afghan forces that will serve as force multipliers.

To be sure, future concessions from Pakistan are likely to be tactical in nature and should be taken with a grain of salt. Trump's speech should be followed through with concrete actions, including extending drone strikes to Taliban and Haqqani leadership in Pakistan and imposing targeted financial and travel sanctions on known Pakistani intelligence and military personnel who abet these groups.

Diplomatic isolation of Pakistan should also be on the cards if Islamabad does not deliver. Finally, Kabul must resist the temptation of trailing into hasty and high-risk peace talks or accepting conditions that favor Pakistan's interests at the expense of Afghan security.

John W. Nicholson, Jr., made the case for an expanded U.S. military commitment to Afghanistan, telling skeptics that the faltering Afghan war was an urgent matter of American security, that the struggling Afghan government was a reliable partner, and that its defense forces just needed more time and U.S. support to become self-sufficient.

Last week, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan finally got his wish.

President Trump, who once advocated abandoning Afghanistan and in recent months questioned the fundamental premises of America's costly 16-year military involvement here, has now publicly committed himself to a strategy that hews closely to the military plan Nicholson and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani hammered out in dozens of meetings this spring and summer.

Now, the burden will be on Nicholson, 61, a boyish-looking four-star general who has spent more time in Afghanistan than any other senior commander, to deliver on what many observers say may be an impossible mission. Its aim is to help Afghan forces turn around a stalemated conflict with the aid of a few thousand extra advisory troops -- something his predecessors failed to do with more than 100,000 combat troops at the war's peak.

[A 'win' in Afghanistan includes peace talks with the Taliban, say U.S. officials in Kabul]

Trump and Nicholson do not know each other, and the general said last week that he communicates with administration officials through the military chain of command, meaning his boss at the U.S. Central Command in Tampa. At one White House meeting to discuss Afghan policy, Trump reportedly threatened to fire the popular Nicholson out of frustration at the stumbling war effort, stunning his aides.

In an interview at his headquarters here Friday, Nicholson declined to discuss that episode, and he referred to Trump's speech on Afghanistan several times rather than answer questions directly. Asked if he now believes the president supports him, Nicholson paused, smiled and answered, ""Yes."" Asked to elaborate, he smiled again and shook his head.

If he has any doubts about his mission here, the congenial but cautious West Pointer has buried them beneath a can-do persona and a glass-half-full approach to every problem. He exudes confidence in Ghani and his determination to reform the Afghan security forces, which have been weakened by corruption and nepotistic leadership. He heaps praise on the Afghan special operations forces, which will be doubled in size and trained by U.S. and NATO advisers under the new military plan.

And he is relentlessly on message about connecting the dots among the ongoing fight against Afghan insurgents; the dangers of terrorism radiating from an unstable, Taliban-plagued Afghanistan; and the American interests at stake in making sure this impoverished Muslim nation does not again become a redoubt for international Islamist militias such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.

""As a soldier, the concern I have is about terrorism emanating from this area,"" Nicholson said in the interview, echoing Trump's speech last Monday on Afghan strategy. ""The requirement to keep pressure on these terror groups to prevent another attack on our homeland . . . fundamentally, that is why we are here.""

Americans, he added, ""need to be concerned about the Islamic State emerging from this region. The Taliban enable them to exist, and if the Taliban were to return, they would flourish."" A return to Taliban rule . . . would mean another threat to our homeland.""

There is also another more personal aspect to Nicholson's commitment: an evident empathy for Afghans and their struggles, developed through four tours of duty totaling five years of immersion in the conflict -- from early optimistic days of sipping tea with tribal elders and inaugurating village projects to later struggles with military setbacks and growing Afghan resentment of the foreign military presence.

[How Afghanistan is ramping up its fight against corruption -- especially among the country's elite]

""I believe in the Afghan people,"" he said. Since his first assignment here in 2006, he continued, ""I came to have great respect and affection for the Afghan people, who have endured an incredible amount of hardship for the last four decades, yet still in spite of all that are incredibly pious, hard-working, hospitable and truly want a better life for their children.""

That attachment deepened during one of the worst crises of the U.S. combat mission, when an airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital killed 42 people in 2015 during a chaotic battle with Taliban forces in the northern city of Kunduz. Several months later, when Nicholson assumed command of the U.S. reduced advisory mission, a U.S. military report came out acknowledging that a series of errors had led to the tragedy. Nicholson immediately apologized to the nation, then flew to Kunduz with his wife and met with families of the victims.

""It was a very emotional and personal event,"" he said. Afghans ""don't want to see a return of Taliban rule, and they genuinely appreciate our help. So when we make a mistake, it is the right thing to do to reach out to them."" The gesture also had a strategic aspect. ""In this culture, when you make a mistake and make a genuine apology,"" Nicholson said, it is ""almost always accepted, and you are able to move on in the relationship. . . . That needs to happen in this long war.""

Lately, Nicholson said he has spent a lot of time consulting with Afghans of all political stripes and affiliations, seeking support and common cause at a time of domestic political turmoil and uncertainty about U.S. intentions, especially with the post of U.S. ambassador vacant since last winter. As a matter of course, he works with senior army, police and intelligence officials.

[In Afghanistan, Trump's speech brings relief to some. To others, 'it means more war, destruction.']

But the Afghan closest to Nicholson is Ghani, a no-nonsense technocrat who is often criticized by Afghans as autocratic and remote. The general, who meets with Ghani several times a week, called him a ""very willing and capable partner"" who is pursuing ""rigorous reforms"" across the government and the security sector, where corruption and poor leadership have been major impediments to the war effort.

Nicholson particularly praised Ghani for replacing a number of senior army and police officials with others who were more qualified and not tainted by corruption. He pointed to the removal of two army commanders in Kandahar and Helmand provinces, one of whom was recently convicted of keeping money for soldiers' food and using combat troops as personal guards. Their replacements, he said, have ""fundamentally changed the environment. . . we're already seeing a difference on the battlefield.""

The general declined to discuss Pakistan's role in the Afghan conflict, although for months he publicly argued in Congress and elsewhere that Pakistan was harboring Taliban fighters and that the U.S. government should pressure Pakistan to stop. In the interview, he was far more circumspect, referring vaguely to the problem of ""external enablement"" of insurgencies but stating that relations under the new U.S. strategy will be ""managed from Washington to Islamabad.""

Nicholson was much more loquacious about the challenges on his own turf, with a ready list of achievements he hopes the expanded U.S. role in Afghanistan will produce. They include the defeat of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, the reduction of foreign support to the insurgents, the increased capacity of the Afghan security forces, and the ""marginalization"" of the Taliban insurgents until they must either ""die or reconcile."" Reconciliation will be complicated, he acknowledged, ""but this conversation needs to begin.""

John Nicholson, top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, speaks during a press conference in Kabul, Afghanistan, Aug. 24. (AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)

Pamela Constable, The Washington Post's Kabul bureau chief, sat down this week with the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson, Jr., for a wide-ranging interview after President Trump's announcement of a new U.S. strategy for Afghanistan. Nicholson expressed his determination to see Islamic State militants defeated there, and Taliban insurgents driven to seek political reconciliation. He praised Afghan President Ashraf Ghani for pressing to reform and professionalize the Afghan defense forces, and expressed a strong emotional connection with the Afghan people. Here is the full transcript of the interview:

[Asia & Pacific U.S. top military commander in Afghanistan finally gets his wish]

Pam Constable (PC): You are the face of this mission, you are said to have a passion for it, a passion for something that many people view as a hopeless military quagmire in a country that is riddled with corruption and divided by ethnic warlordism. Where does your passion come from, what gives you hope, and why have you kept coming back?

Gen. Nicholson: I believe in the Afghan people, for starters, and so from my first experience here in 2006, I came to have great respect and affection for the Afghan people, who have endured an incredible amount of hardship for the last four decades, yet still in spite of all that are incredibly pious, hard-working, hospitable and truly want a better life for their children, so these are all things any of us can relate to and share. Coupled with that, as a soldier, is the concern I have about terrorism emanating from this area and when we have the potential to work with people like the Afghans to bring about stability who are so grateful for our presence here and our help then we have the ingredients for a successful outcome, where we reduce the potential for terrorism coming from the region that can threaten our homeland and those of our allies.

PC: You have seen both high and low points in your four or five tours here, when we first met you were a colonel and just landed in Laghman to inaugurate a bridge. It was a time of optimism, with a sense of Afghan support and cooperation. Since then there have been a myriad of setbacks that have strained relations and caused a buildup of Afghan frustration and resentment against foreign forces. There have been numerous green on blue attacks, even by members of the Afghan Special Forces, on which your mission is banking so much. Perhaps the low point for you was the airstrike on the hospital in Kunduz in April 2016, shortly after you assumed command, for which you personally apologized to the Afghan people. Can you briefly talk about that incident and other setbacks and what lessons came from them?

Gen. Nicholson: Sure, just one point of fact, the airstrike occurred in October of 2015, before I took command and then the report came out after I took command. So I was the commander when the results of the investigation were released and then I went up there with Norine (MacDonald, Nicholson's wife) to apologize. So let me take this down to a human level. What I found is quite often, in the case of green-on-blue attacks, you actually find a troubled individual, a confused individual, who has been influenced in a negative manner to conduct these attacks. I have never seen this green-on-blue phenomenon reflect a broad or concerted effort on the part of a general reaction to our presence. It has typically been an individual acting often on his own or maybe with one or two others; that's it. Therefore, I don't universalize this green-on-blue phenomenon. I don't believe the green on blue reflects any trend across the Afghan security forces, rather it reflects the actions of individuals who for a variety of reasons choose to do that. So moving on to the visit to Kunduz, this has been a long war and these people have endured an incredible hardship and in spite of that, the vast majority of these people, close to 90 percent reject the Taliban. They don't want to see a return of the Taliban rule and they appreciate, genuinely appreciate our help. So when we make a mistake, as occurred in October 2015, and strike a hospital, it is the right thing to do, to reach out to them on a personal basis. In this case we apologized, once the investigation was complete; we determined that, yes, we had made a mistake. It was the appropriate thing to do on a number of levels; on a human level, it is the right thing to do. On a cultural level, in this culture, when you make a genuine apology for your actions -- and that is normally almost always accepted -- and then you are able to move on in the relationship. On the other hand if you don't apologize, if you try to characterize the event as something else than you do irreparable damage to your relationship. So it was extremely important to do that with not only the community, which my wife and I did, and we met with the individual families who lost their loved ones, and that, as you can imagine, was a very emotional and personal event, but that was important to the healing process. That needs to happen in this long war, and then, since then, my wife stayed in touch with the families to remain in contact with them. So we care about these families, we care about these on a personal level so I will give you another example. So after the 31 May bombing, when seven Afghan policemen died protecting the government and diplomatic community by not allowing that huge bomb into the green zone, and they did their job. This individual had paperwork that would have allowed him into here and potentially could have been even worse than what it was and so we invited the families to those who were killed and those who were wounded to personally express our appreciation. This is really important that we do this, and they know that we do care about them as people and as individuals and we respect and honor their sacrifice and know they are fighting on behalf of us, and also the reason we don't require so many forces here is because the Afghans own the war, and these are the words of President Ghani: ""We own the war; we want to own the war."" They just ask for our help in this, so, therefore, I think that given the threat of terrorism coming from the region and their willingness to fight against these terrorists with our help is the key reason why we should stay, not only to help them but to protect our own homeland and those of our allies.

PC: Your recent comments, as well as President Trump's, seem to be describing two wars against two enemies in Afghanistan ... the Taliban and the forces of international terrorism ... there are two separate audiences for these messages: the Afghan people who are desperately seeking peace and the American voter tired of the Afghan war but who understand the need to fight terror. Are these fights complementary or contradictory?

Gen. Nicholson: The president, in his speech, has acknowledged that we have not been attacked in this region since we got here. I think fundamentally that requirement to keep pressure on these terror groups to prevent another attack on our homeland, I think that fundamentally ... that is why we're here, and that is because of the Taliban. So the Taliban had provided that environment, they maintained the relationship with these terrorist groups, even though these recognize that the reason they were removed from power is because of their hospitality to al-Qaeda; they had maintained that relationship ... so they don't talk about it publicly, but they still cooperate and work together on the battlefield. So a return to Taliban rule in Afghanistan is a return to al-Qaeda. And a return to al-Qaeda would mean another threat to our homeland ... and, of course, another thing President Trump mentioned in his speech is the presence of more than 20 terrorist groups, one of the highest concentrations in the world. So another dynamic we've seen over the last 16 years is the emergence of a variety of these groups. And so this also is a reason to remain here. And this is also a something the Afghan people reject as well. The best example is Daesh. Islamic State, the membership of ISIS-K, is mainly Pakistani, Pashtu from TTP and Islamic Movement Uzbekistan, two foreign groups that came together to form this group and then attempting to take over parts of Afghanistan. So their method of operation, their barbaric behavior, is all abhorrent to Afghan culture, so they're totally rejected by the Afghans, but they need our help to defeat them. But they're the ones leading the fight against Daesh, typically in the form of their special forces, advised by our special forces, but together they have effectively squeezed Daesh into one third of the space that was occupied, killed over half of their fighters, killed their last three leaders, and so on ... so this in an area where Americans need to be concerned about Islamic State emerging from this region. The Taliban enable them exist, and if the Taliban were to return they would flourish, al-Qaeda would exist here once again, and therefore, if we have a willing partner in the Afghans with a modest investment from the U.S., then this is a good investment in our eyes.

PC: My point was more the Afghans are seeking a peaceful settlement.

Gen. Nicholson: Oh, sure.

PC: ... with the Taliban, where the terrorist thing is more of a fight to the death. These are two really different kind of wars.

Gen. Nicholson: On that point, the president mentioned that we would welcome a reconciliation, certainly, as a part of our desired end state here; that's how this war ends, with reconciliation between belligerents. That reconciliation will occur when the Taliban realize they cannot win. Them realizing they cannot win is a condition that leads us to reconciliation ... They need to recognize that the door is open for reconciliation, that needs to be put out there and it has been. And I see many Afghans working this every day, but we need to keep military pressure on the Taliban so they realize they can't win and their best choice is to rejoin society.

PC: Let me go back to the other questions that I was going to ask ... you said this week that you had communicated with President Trump essentially through the chain of command, mainly Gen. [Joseph] Votel at CENTCOM, implying that you had never spoken with him directly. In a recent White House meeting, the president reportedly threatened to fire you and was frustrated by the lack of progress in the war. Do you believe today that President Trump has your back?

Gen. Nicholson: That's an interesting question ... yes.

PC: Anything else? I'll take that as a yes ... President Trump spoke on Monday about being determined to win in Afghanistan. Others, including Secretary [of State Rex] Tillerson and yourself, have framed the issue on how to prevent defeat or failure, what would success or the acceptable avoidance of failure look like to you in Afghanistan?

Gen. Nicholson: Well first it would mean that ISIS-K and al-Qaeda are defeated, destroyed and that other terrorist groups have no freedom of action to pursue their agendas from Afghanistan. That's one. Second is external enablement of these groups and terrorists would be reduced or hopefully eliminated. External enablement. Third, the Afghan security forces grow in capacity, and that's primarily through the special forces, and the air force would expand their control of the country to say ... at least 80 percent. This then leads to a set of conditions for reconciliation. So the insurgents are then increasingly marginalized, frankly, either die or reconcile. So next would be an adequate level of political and economic progress to enable the government to be self-sustaining, and this would include the conducting of fair and credible elections in 2018 and 2019. Those are the elements I think success would look like over the next few years.

PC: You have placed a tremendous amount of faith and confidence in President Ghani, you have worked closely with him on the four year military road map, you've especially pointed to his efforts to fight corruption and bring professionalism to the security sector. But President Ghani is struggling and is distracted by internal and external opposition, much of it is motivated by pushback against his reform efforts. His government lacks a popular mandate and constitutional legitimacy. Do you think he is going to be able to deliver?

Gen. Nicholson: Yes, I do. So first off, President Ghani has already delivered international support for Afghanistan. Starting on the July 2016 Warsaw summit, where the coalition, largely because of their belief in President Ghani and the Afghan people, extended their mandate by four years, to resource the security forces and to extend the presence of NATO troops and coalition troops for four years. And second, the Brussels donor conference, where again President Ghani invested a tremendous amount of personal effort, and by him and his whole government team, and they received $15 billion in pledges for economic developmental assistance over the next several years. And third is the recently concluded policy process with the United States, which President Ghani and his team were key partners in producing that. And this one example is one of the things we talked about yesterday the compact between the U.S. and Afghanistan, and this was offered by President Ghani, he said hold us accountable, here's what we will do, and we will work together on this compact in the security arena. There are literally hundreds of milestones and benchmarks that the Afghans have agreed to meet, for which we will hold them accountable. So I think the answer to the first question: He has delivered. He has delivered international support and extended the mandate. And the United States policy that supports Afghanistan. And he has done this because he has been a very willing and capable partner and working with us for the security of Afghanistan and the security, indeed, of all of the coalition. This is extremely important. On the reform and counter-corruption agenda, I think this is extremely important. It has been a big part of credibility within the international community and certainty, and certainly when you implement such a rigorous reform effort, there is going to be people who will resist that, and I think that can explain some of the political resistance that he has experienced as he has gone forward with his reform agenda. And so within the security sector, the reform agenda has been absolutely critical to success, and so we support this reform agenda, and I think that over time this is going to be -- the results of this are going to be demonstrated, the results will be appreciated by the Afghan people, the impact of this reform agenda. I know I am speaking for the security sector in particular, we're already seeing a difference on the battlefield.

PC: You are basically saying that time will tell. It will become clear over time. Because you know, right now we got all this controversy over people like [Vice President Abdul Rashid] Dostum and [Gov. ] Atta [Muhammad Nur] -- these different people who have gone rogue, essentially -- and bringing in this whole other big problem with this whole ethnic rivalry and violence that has nothing to do with the war.

Gen. Nicholson: So on this, this is why we work very close with President Ghani. I have seen him, you know, typically four times a week along with Chief Executive [Abdullah] Abdullah and the security ministers, but we also meet frequently with members, political elites who are outside the government, so that they know and believe, and it's true that we are engaged with all Afghans, those in government as well as those outside of government, and so what I ask them is to say that please do not allow ethnic or political agendas to affect the cohesion of the military. That the military and police should be national forces and that police support the security services and do not allow these forces to affect their ability to secure the nation. And universally, they agree with us. I have been very encouraged by that. While there are political differences that you would expect in the year before an election, you are going to see a more intense political cycle emerge. But in spite of that, there is almost a universal support for the military. And this reflects in the the polling we are doing: 76 percent of the Afghan people have high confidence in their military and police; 87 percent believe the return to be Taliban would be bad for the nation.

P.C. I had a long interview recently with someone you know (name inaudible) who had just come from a long meeting with you, just by chance, and we were discussing this very issue. He was making those same points.

Gen. Nicholson: He, Minister Salay, professor Sayaf, former government officials like Vice President Kununi, Minister Bizmala Khan Wardak, I mean I meet with shuras in different parts ... down in Kandahar with the provincial council members I know well, and we host them here when they come up. We maintain an active dialogue with all these groups of Afghan society. I am always encouraged by their strong support for the security forces.

P.C. They probably say the army more than the police.

Gen. Nicholson: Yeah it's interesting. The young police officers, like these brave seven that died out here, I find they are doing their job every day, and that is the -- when I hear complaints about the leadership and that is why back to President Ghani's focus on anti-corruption, the replacement of leaders at senior level both in MoI and MoD have been crucial. I will give you a couple of examples. We have two new corps commanders in the south, Brigadier General Amidzi, now-Major General Amidzi in Helmand, and MG Azir in Kandahar ... so these two core commanders of the 205th and 215th fundamentally changed the environment down there. And (name inaudible), who's an Uzbek in Kandahar, works extremely well with other security leaders there, and there connecting with the people. So what we're seeing there is a soldier of the nation who is connecting with the people, who happens to be an Uzbek, who's in the heartland of the former Taliban, and largely delivering security for what is mostly a Pashtun population. This, to me, is indicative of a focus on quality not ethics. There was some discussion about do you put an Uzbek in Kandahar; he's turned out to be great. And then General Ahmadzi's Pasthtun, but from a different part of the country, and he's being successful in Helmand. And we have General Mobin, who's Hazaran, who's the corps commander in the north. And that's a very complex and difficult area. But he's doing, where he goes out and does military operations, he's having success because he's a very good commander and he's been selected based on merit. When Ghani did this, when he selected the corps commanders, he lowered the age by an average of 10 years. So it's a younger generation, and what he's after is sort of a generational change, and the leadership of the military and police.

PC: And just coincidentally on the other side of the coin, I just covered the trial of the commander from Helmand, and it was very interesting.

Gen. Nicholson: He's the guy I replaced. I mean, look at the contrast, right. This guy was selling food to his own soldiers, stealing fuel. I mean, it's unbelievable.

PC: The allegation that he had forced, that he had required, 30 active troops under his command to go guard his house and drive his kids to places is crazy.

Gen. Nicholson: He was relieved by President Ghani and was replaced by Brigadier General Ahmadzi, who came out of the brigade in Kunar and was sent to Helmand. And Ahmadzi has turned that place around and the 215th Corps, in terms of its effectiveness on the battlefield, through personal leadership. And this is why the selection that Ghani is making based on merit is so important for the future of this country.

PC: This is something you may not want to discuss in detail, but perhaps some of it you can. You have repeatedly pointed out the critical role of Pakistan in being a part of the problem or part of the solution of the Afghan conflict, especially in terms of sanctuary for insurgents and terrorists. President Trump has warned he will take measures against Pakistan if they do not stop halt such support. But previous American administrations have made the same warnings, with little effect. Pakistan now has strong backing from China. The primary concern remains Indian hegemony and how to counteract it. Do you have any sign that Pakistan is more likely to respond to U.S. pressure on Afghanistan now or signs that its thinking may be changing?

Gen. Nicholson: First, I'd say that the Pakistanis have suffered grievously at the hands of terrorists, and they have their security forces that fought and fight bravely, and courageously against certain terrorists inside their country and we respect that. On the other hand, President Trump laid out the current state of U.S.-Pakistan relations, and I really have nothing to add to that. I think we are at a crucial point in our relations, and this'll be managed from Washington to Islamabad. That's about all I have to say about that.

PC: Actually it was your testimony, about the Haqqanis and others, but yours, I think, was the salient one that got everyone's attention. So it's not as if it's something you haven't talked about or expressed concern about.

Gen. Nicholson: I'll say historically, if an insurgency enjoys external enablement, it's very difficult to defeat. So concerns about external enablement are extremely important to our chances of success in the conflict. I'll just leave it at that. Sorry, Pam, maybe another time.

PC: President Trump did not talk about the other important regional players, especially Iran and Russia, which are keenly interested in influencing Afghanistan and the conflict and which I'm sure concerns you. In your view, what should the U.S. be doing to help ensure that these powerful regional neighbors do not interfere?

Gen. Nicholson: I think the regional neighbors share common interests with the coalition and Afghanistan. Number one would be the spillover of terrorism. So we share in interest in counterterrorism, and especially the concerns about Daesh, so I would hope that the neighbors realize that the Afghan special forces, enabled by U.S. counterterrorism forces, are the ones who will defeat Daesh, not the Taliban. So, in the context of CT, the support of neighbors should be going to the Afghan government and its forces, and the defeat of these terrorists. The Afghans and their U.S. advisers are fighting the fight that will benefit the neighbors, and so therefore our efforts should be supported and not undermined by support to the Taliban.

The second concern is counternarcotics. So, the narcotics trafficking out of Afghanistan and into Iran and Russia sadly results in tens of thousands of deaths every year. You'd think that these nations would work closely with the government of Afghanistan to cooperate against the flow of narcotics.

That would be issue number two, and then, with respect to Afghanistan and Iran in particular, you have areas of mutual interest like water. Water from Afghanistan into Iran. You have areas of mutual interest like economic development, the port of Chabahar, and the potential economic route from central Asia through Afghanistan, out through Iran to Chabahar. So there are areas of mutual interest. So I would hope that these areas of mutual interest would be used to build a positive relationship that would reinforce the stability of Afghanistan, not undermine it.

PC: It's very complicated, especially with Iran. They have so much interest, positive interest here, with this huge Hazara community, and all of these attacks that are happening now, like the one today, against all these Shiite targets -- and yet, there are all these accusations that Iran is actively fomenting support for Taliban, even in Syria. It's very tricky.

Gen. Nicholson: It is. Historically, when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, they murdered Iranian diplomats. So it's surprising to hear of Iranian support to these people who are not their natural allies.

PC: Most Afghans I've spoken to are appalled at the idea of the U.S. sending in private contractors to substitute for government troops here, saying it would destroy Afghan trust and goodwill in the United States. Do you think there's still any chance that the Trump administration will decide to bring in such contractors?

Gen. Nicholson: As the president discussed, he considered other options before deciding on this course of action. But now that this course of action has been selected, that's not a part of this. I would point out that we have a significant number of contractors performing many functions beyond those envisioned in those proposals you referenced.

PC: So you think that's really off the table now?

Gen. Nicholson: That's my read. I mean, the president made a decision.

PC: That's all the questions I have.

Gen. Nicholson: You asked about India, and I didn't say anything about India. I did want to mention the tremendously positive role that India's played here. As you probably are aware, they're one of the top donors, with over $3 billion in donations or pledges; they've done significant infrastructure projects like parliament, like the road from Delaram to Zaranj, the Psalm and Friendship Dam, the education of literally thousands of Afghans, and then a small amount of military support in the form of those helicopters. So my belief is that India was the first nation to conduct a strategic partnership with Afghanistan -- I think it was in 2011 -- so there's a friendship and a support from India and Afghanistan, that I think can lead to greater stability in Afghanistan and the region. And it's not a threat to the neighbors; this is something that's regional nations helping each other, which I think is very positive. I was heartened to hear the president support this relationship with India and India's role in Afghanistan because I agree it can be very important.

PC: Of course it is, as one person put it, a red flag to a bull with the Pakistanis. They see everything as an absolutely zero-sum game in terms of India. The enemy of my enemy ... you know what I mean.

Gen. Nicholson: I'm sure that this is part of the dialogue that's going on bilaterally between Washington and Islamabad.

PC: I just wonder. I just wonder what will happen there. I've heard there was some sort of huge celebration today in Pakistan, or not a celebration, but some sort of big gathering of religious leaders calling for, you know, ""We're going to defend our nation against Trump."" The Pakistanis are incredibly nationalistic, and it's amazing to hear everyone from right-wing leaders to Imran Khan saying ... ""We can't be bullied by America."" So they all come together when it comes to that, even when they all hate each other and criticize each other constantly. It's a very interesting country.

Gen. Nicholson: I hope, you know, as the president said, there's much to gain by working together with us.

PC: Is there anything else you would like to say?

Gen. Nicholson: I know you've done a lot of articles, I read your stuff, I think it's very accurate. You've touched upon a lot of stuff over time -- I mean, the ANDSF[, or Afghan National Defense Security Forces,] planning, the different events that have occurred ... I'm trying to think of anything you've not covered, or we haven't discussed here, but honestly I don't see much. We've talked about reconciliation, we talked about external enablement, you know, President Ghani has a willing and valued partner in this cooperation.

I would like to mention the alliance. Because that's something we didn't talk about.

PC: You mean NATO?

Gen. Nicholson: Yeah, so, we have a coalition of 39 nations, and last year when the U.S., when President Obama decided in June of '16 to raise our investment of troops from 5,500 to 8,450, you'll recall that the alliance immediately pledged to remain at the same level, and in some cases we even had increases. So, the legitimacy we get from the presence of 38 other nations, and the physical support, which is sometimes underestimated. The number tops 7,000, so not all these are counted against the NATO requirement, but there's over 7,000 allies here, so this is significant. And let's take the role of Germany in the north. Germany has a coalition of 19 other nations up there with them, in the north, very committed to the north. So this alliance is critical to the effort going forward. So as the NATO commander, number one, I really appreciate them being here. They bring capacity that we couldn't provide, to be candid. So the presence in the north and the west, and the presence in Kabul ... so you've got the German lead in the north, the Italians in the west and the Turks in Kabul... they provide the framework for all of our operations in those areas. And they have been steadfast in their support. Even in this June of '17. So in July of '16 they immediately pledged to stay at the same level or higher. And in June of 17, when the U.S. policy was under consideration, they pledged another 650 troops above the current pledge. So, we've seen a steady level of support from all the allies for this mission. [NATO] Secretary General [Jens] Stoltenberg's comments, you know, you can just look at them to see the steady support that they've had for this. So I think we should, we need to acknowledge and value their support as well because it's not just the United States going along here; this is 39 nations here together. We all see the benefits of protecting our homelands and, frankly, reducing migration. Afghans were the second-largest group of migrants into Europe, behind Syria. So this investment here, it's not just the United States, it's the United States plus 38 other allies, that have been here along with us for all this time. So, I know your audience is back in the states primarily, but I mean that's something important for them to understand. These nations have remained with us.

PC: Particularly since President Trump has been harping for a long time on getting them to step up to the plate, on various things, not just this.

Gen. Nicholson: You know, the Warsaw Summit, they all pledged another four years of financial support to the security forces. At Brussels they pledged $15 billion in assistance, and then with this U.S. policy announcement, on the margins of this, when this was being discussed, and allies knew it was important that the U.S. see additional contributions. Another 650 were pledged in advance, and now we have another half-dozen nations that have indicated they're ready to pledge more too. So I think we're going to see in the coming months more pledges from the alliance to augment what we're going to provide. So this is really important. I think it needs to be acknowledged.

PC: Can you envision a time when there will be a government here that will include the Taliban? That may be truly representative of all the segments of this nation?

Gen. Nicholson: Absolutely. A reconciliation is just that, and most wars end with belligerents joining together in the future governance of a nation, so absolutely that could happen. Now, this is a conversation that needs to happen between Afghans, and then the Afghan government needs to put provisions on the table, such as agreement with the provisions of the Afghan constitution, with protections for human rights, so there are some fundamental things -- a renouncement of violence and support to terrorism -- so there's been some pretty clear conditions put on the table, but if those are met, then absolutely. And you know, I get these, in many of the leaders that I talk to out of government in particular, they talk about they are having conversations with members of the Taliban who do want to rejoin -- I'm sure you've heard the same thing.

PC: One thing they always say, the one giant caveat, is always, ""but American/foreign forces have to leave."" That's always there, big sticking point.

Gen. Nicholson: Yeah, but this conversation needs to begin, or continue. So I think, there is a perception ... Well, some are irreconcilable; well, they just won't want to reconcile under any conditions. Some believe they can win militarily, so they need to understand they can't win militarily -- now that we've gone to a conditions-based presence and not a time-based presence -- they cannot win. So if you put the irreconcilables aside, then really what we're talking about are those that, once they realize they cannot win, will say, look, we want a better life for our kids. And they can't help but miss what's been going on in Afghanistan in the last 15 years. You look at pictures of Kabul in 2001 and pictures of Kabul today, there's no comparison. When you look at the education, the health care, the benefits, the life is better for the average Afghan. And then increasingly, the Taliban, as you know, Pam, has become very involved in the drug trade and criminal activities, and so the Taliban are not a political movement supported by the people inside the country. Ninety percent of them reject the Taliban. And then the Taliban's activities of killing civilians, and being engaged in narcotics trafficking, illegal mining, kidnapping, murder for hire, all of these things are moving them further and further away from any kind of legitimacy with the Afghan people. So when they stop engaging in those activities and rejoin the government, then yeah, I think ... there are former Taliban that, of course, are a part of Afghan society and governance.

PC: I hope it happens in my lifetime.

Donald Trump is now the third American president saddled with the intractable problem of Afghanistan. His strategy for pursuing a war in that south Asian country was not one he had wanted to embrace. But in the end, it was the only course he could take to protect the interests of the United States.

Trump, who ran on a promise to disentangle America from the affairs of other nations, and particularly to end the quagmires in Afghanistan and Iraq, last week gave the OK for a troop an increase that experts predict will add 3,000-5,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan.

In doing so, Trump committed the nation to a long-term presence there, one that may outlast his presidency. This new strategy is an acknowledgment that there is no quick fix for Afghanistan.

Taking the advice of his generals, Trump agreed to substantially add to the training and assist forces supporting the Afghan army.

To his credit, former President Barack Obama recognized that Afghanistan had to take responsibility for its own security. He pursued a strategy that built the native forces to 300,000, and set them against the Taliban insurgents.

But his aggressive draw down of U.S. troops left the Afghans with too little support, and his strict rules of engagement often prevented the ones left from taking a more active role when needed.

""The result is that we are burning through the Afghan army,"" says James Carafano, a foreign policy expert with the Heritage Foundation. ""It's not a sustainable strategy. And that's what the military complained about.""

Under the Trump plan, U.S. forces will get down to the tactical level, providing better ground and air fire support coordination, more logistical support and better medical evacuation aid.

Carafano says the new approach is informed by both the successes and failures of the previous administrations.

The Bush administration let Afghanistan fester while it pursued Saddam Hussein in Iraq. And Obama, in its too rapid withdrawal from Iraq and lack of engagement in Syria, left the door open for ISIS.

This new Afghanistan strategy should allow the country to sustain a fighting force in the field strong enough to deplete the Taliban. It will also extract a cost from those in neighboring Pakistan who profit from aiding the Taliban.

It changes the goal of a negotiated power sharing agreement with the Taliban to one that presses for its defeat, disarmament and reintegration, according to Carafano's analysis.

It also seeks to engage India in economic development efforts in Afghanistan.

Trump avoided specifying the number of new troops that are being deployed to Afghanistan, and did not set a timetable for accomplishing the mission, so the Taliban will not be able to hole up and let the clock tick down.

""What we have now is a clear mission and strategy for accomplishing what we want to achieve,"" Carafano says.

How long will that take? ""I think it's indefinite,"" Carafano says. ""That's one of the reasons Trump struggled so much with the decision.""

Having laid out a new strategy, the president is obliged to sell the American people on why stabilizing Afghanistan is in the interest of the United States.

It is essential that Afghanistan not be allowed to become an ongoing source of regional instability, in the manner of Iraq and Syria. Nor can it become a launching pad for international terror.

After 16 years, $700 billion and 2,000 lives, Afghanistan is not where Americans want to be. But the price for leaving now is too high to pay.

Donald Trump's decision to send more troops to Afghanistan -- announced Monday night in a prime-time address to the nation -- was the right call, but it was a 180-degree turn from what he promised during the campaign.

As both a private citizen and as a presidential candidate, he repeatedly criticized the war in Afghanistan, urging the United States to end the conflict there. Monday night, he largely abandoned that idea, recommitting the U.S. to the nation's longest-running war.

Trump did dress up this decision with his own rhetoric, promising that American troops would no longer be nation-building but instead killing terrorists. If that actually leads to a change in policy, that would be a good thing: for years nation-building, though successful elsewhere in the world, has seemed to be a pointless exercise in Afghanistan. No matter how many schools and hospitals we build, the nation always seems to be in the grip of anarchy, or just on the verge of it. If the U.S. focuses its efforts in Afghanistan on defeating the Taliban instead of trying to build a functional democracy, we might have a chance at some kind of success there -- though exactly what form that will take remains to be seen.

Trump is taking an enormous risk here, both strategically and politically.

Politically, many of his most ardent supporters will no doubt be disappointed that he ditched his early promises to get out of Afghanistan. Before he became a candidate, he frequently criticized the cost of the war and its lack of success, often employing the type of ""bring the war dollars home"" language more commonly used by the left. As a candidate, though, he stepped back from that, recognizing that he could not immediately bring the troops home. Now, as president, he's doing the complete opposite by sending more troops there.

This kind of change is nothing new in American politics. Many a presidential candidate has employed isolationist language while on the hustings, only to have their minds changed completely once they sat behind the Resolute desk. Barack Obama also promised to end the war in Afghanistan, but instead raised troop levels there -- while simultaneously ratcheting up the drone program. Before him, George W. Bush campaigned against nation-building and using the U.S. military as as an international sheriff, criticizing many of Clinton's military actions abroad. As president, of course, he launched the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and engaged in a global war on terror after Sept. 11.

Strategically, Trump will face critics who argue that this change is more rhetorical than anything. After all, it might be all well and good to move away from nation-building, but if you're simply increasing the troop levels instead is that really much of a change?

It's a more militaristic approach, to be sure, but it might not necessarily be more successful. Indeed, although Trump promised that the U.S. wouldn't be leaving Afghanistan before achieving success there, he offered no hints at a definition of that success.

Is success in Afghanistan simply defeating the Taliban? If so, how thorough does that defeat have to be?

It's unlikely (though not impossible) that the Taliban will ever sign a formal peace treaty with the government in Kabul and lay down their arms. They're in it for the long haul, with an experienced insurgency that is embedded within the local population and prepared to continue no matter how long it takes. They didn't abandon their fight after the last surge of troops, and they're not likely to after this surge, either.

The war in Afghanistan isn't just a conflict launched by the United States and its allies after the Sept. 11 attacks. It's also a civil war that, next year, will be entering its 40th year. That's an enormous part of the reason that it's so difficult for the U.S. to define success in Afghanistan: it's not our conflict, just one we were drawn into after an attack.

It's certainly in the interests of the U.S. to defeat the Taliban. They're a violent extremist group with international reach that befriends those who wish to destroy us. If we stick to that goal, of defeating the Taliban rather than ending the war or establishing a stable government, we might be able to declare victory and go home. However, there's every reason to believe that after we leave, chaos, violence and corruption will continue, making it difficult to tell victory from defeat.

The war in Afghanistan isn't just a conflict launched by the United States and its allies after the September 11 attacks. It's also a civil war that, next year, will be entering its 40th year. That's an enormous part of the reason that it's so difficult for the U.S. to define success in Afghanistan: it's not our conflict, just one we were drawn into after an attack.

It's certainly in the interests of the U.S. to defeat the Taliban. They're a violent extremist group with international reach that befriends those who wish to destroy us. If we stick to that goal, of defeating the Taliban rather than ending the war or establishing a stable government, we might be able to declare victory and go home. However, there's every reason to believe that after we leave, chaos, violence and corruption will continue, making it difficult to tell victory from defeat.

Now that President Trump has become the third consecutive commander-in-chief to increase America's commitment in Afghanistan, it's time for lawmakers from both political parties and in both houses of Congress to press the administration for the details.

Trump's address to the nation on the course of the Afghan campaign was long on aspiration but short on actual policy. The American people -- and most importantly, the men and women of the armed forces who will be ordered into a combat environment -- deserve a full, detailed, and comprehensive explanation of what Trump has in mind. Here are five questions that members of Congress should send to the administration.

1.What does winning look like?

This is the most essential question that Congress must ask. President Trump used the words ""win"" and ""victory"" on a number of occasions throughout his speech, but he failed to clearly define those words. It is dangerous for any country, let alone a superpower that has already sacrificed more than 2,400 soldiers and spent more than $700 billion, to deepen its involvement in an armed conflict without some idea of what the objectives are and when the mission can be declared over.

2. How many troops will be sent?

Trump refused to disclose publicly how small or large the troop surge will be, saying that ""we will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities."" There may be some logic to keeping the enemy in the dark, but America's elected officials have a responsibility to comprehend just how many of their constituents will be deployed to a war. As an independent and co-equal branch of government with primary oversight responsibility in the U.S. Constitution, it would be a dereliction if Congress failed to ask this most obvious of questions.

3.What conditions are placed on the Afghan government?

Trump is correct that American military and financial assistance to the Afghan government will continue to fail without substantial reform. What he didn't explain, however, is what those reforms should look like or what conditions Washington expects Kabul to meet.

It's smart for the U.S. to condition its warfighting aid on the host nation's willingness to get its own house in order, especially in a place like Afghanistan, where corruption is embedded within the political system. But the conditions need to be spelled out both to the Afghan government and to American personnel in country if the scheme has any chance of working. With a war that is already the longest in America's history, it is only fair for Afghanistan and its troops to be given some clear benchmarks to meet, and to be held accountable for meeting them.

4. How much will it cost?

According to the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, the U.S. has spent $714 billion on warfighting and reconstruction in Afghanistan since fiscal year 2002. Congress appropriated more than $4 billion to the Afghan national-security forces for 2017 alone, a price tag that will presumably go up now that the administration has settled on a new strategy that will require more American trainers over a longer period of time. Americans ought to know how many more of their taxpayer dollars will be diverted to this cause.

As the appropriators of the people's money, the Armed Services, Budget, and Appropriations Committees must force administration officials to come up with a number. This war is has been paid by credit card for far too long, with the bill contributing to an immoral $20 trillion national debt.

5. What will our NATO allies chip in?

Members of Congress must hold the administration accountable to its new plan.

""We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy with additional troop and funding increases in line with our own,"" Trump declared. How many troops NATO will send and how large a check it will cut, however, are a mystery. Operation Resolute Support is indeed a NATO mission, even if the U.S. is on the hook for most of the manpower. Yet if Washington is being asked to step up, America's European allies also have a responsibility to step up. The plan that Trump outlined on Monday is as much NATO's as it is America's. The administration is confident that NATO will rise to the occasion; Congress should hold the administration to it.

Trump's decision to prolong and expand the war in Afghanistan goes against the realistic foreign-policy promises that got him elected. At the very least, members of Congress must hold the administration accountable to its new plan.

The US is aware of Afghan Taliban leaders' presence in Quetta and Peshawar areas in Pakistan, General John Nicholson, the commander of US Forces and Nato in Afghanistan, said on Saturday (26 August).

Pakistan has to stop support to these militants, the commander said during an exclusive interview with Afghanistan's Tolo News agency. He added that the issue was being addressed diplomatically.

""The Quetta Shura, Peshawar Shura, these shuras are identified by cities inside Pakistan, we know Afghan Taliban leaders are in these areas,"" the general said. He stressed the need to address the issue of outside sanctuaries for militants, but noted that it was ""being addressed in private between the US government and the Pakistani government"".

""Support for terrorists and insurgents has to be reduced, has to be stopped.

""I am primarily focused on activities inside Afghanistan,"" but other officials are looking into the issue of sanctuaries in Pakistan, Nicholson added.

He did not rule out a diplomatic solution to the issue and noted that together the US would work with the Afghan government to increase its military capabilities to fight Taliban.

Elaborating on the Afghanistan strategy following US President Donald Trump's announcement earlier this week on increasing troops in the country, Nicholson suggested there will be a full-fledged assault on the militants.

He added that he has a new policy for Afghanistan - ""one based on conditions and not time"".

""It gives us additional capabilities. We have a direction now provided by the US policy that is being supported by Nato.

""The Taliban cause the vast majority of civilian casualties and even though they have stated that it is their objective to reduce civilian casualties they have in fact increased civilian casualties,"" Nicholson said about the civilian casualties of the ongoing anti-militancy campaign.

""This [civilian casualties] is one of the points that we need to put on the table with the Taliban. They are not acting in the best interests of the Afghan people.

When asked if he sees the Taliban as a terrorist organisation, Nicholson told Tolo News: ""They do terrorist activities and they enable terrorists."" He likened the group to al-Qaeda militant group.

When asked if he had the mandate to go out and kill Taliban militants, Nicholson said: ""It is our mandate to put military pressure on the Taliban.""","[{'uri': 'ananya_roy@ibtimes.co.uk', 'name': 'Ananya Roy', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOLO_(TV_channel)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'TOLO (TV channel)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta_Shura', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta Shura'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}]",https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1440577/afghan-taliban-attack-kabul-guest-house.jpg,eng-3382459,0.0117647058823529,241528680,1,ibtimes.co.uk,news,International Business Times UK,Taliban United States Armed Forces Pakistan Afghanistan Peshawar TOLO (TV channel) Quetta Shura Government of Pakistan NATO Insurgency Terrorism Quetta Politics of Afghanistan Donald Trump Demographics of Afghanistan Al-Qaeda,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,27,18,11,2017-08-27

Cepeda/ZUMA Press/NewscomSteve Bannon's Brietbart and others notwithstanding, that was Trump being Trump when he announced he would not be quitting Afghanistan, despite the manifest futility and counterproductivity -- that is, idiocy -- of America's 16-year war there. He is not a captive of ""my generals,"" bad as they are. He is his own man.

Just look at the attitude toward military power he displayed throughout his presidential campaign and young presidency. He boasted of being the most ""militaristic"" candidate in the large Republican field -- and that was saying something. He promised to ""bomb the shit"" out of ISIS, torture terrorist suspects, and kill their families. He promised to win.

So now he says his military's renewed effort in Afghanistan will be directed at killing terrorists and eradicating evil. What else is new?

The great disrupter of the establishment turns out to be -- surprise, surprise -- a man of the establishment. He craves its acceptance and adoration, but he'll settle for the love of his base until the real thing comes along. ""If you can't be with the one you love, honey,"" Stephen Stills wrote, ""love the one you're with."" The base may not like that he has put his ""instincts"" about Afghanistan on a shelf, but so be it.

Sure, during Barack Obama's second term Trump questioned the wisdom of staying the course in Afghanistan, although in October 2015 he said, ""At this point we probably have to [leave US troops there] because that thing will collapse in about two seconds after they leave."" The pro-withdrawal statements are easily explained in light of the Trumpian MO. As J.P. Sottile writes, ""Trump never had a 'policy' of anti-interventionism. He was simply a troll who tweeted out oppositional statements attacking Obama's foreign policy. If Obama was doing it ... he was against it. He knew that no matter what, it was red meat for his future base.... Sorry, but [his turn to intervene] wasn't a Deep State plot....""

Does anyone know what Trump's position on Afghanistan was on Sept. 12, 2001? I see nothing on the record, but it is hard to believe he opposed George W. Bush's invasion and occupation back then. It would have been out of character, to say the least, for him to have opposed a military response to 9/11. He probably thought Donald Rumsfeld's war-on-the-cheap strategy was for losers. Moreover, while he dishonestly and repeatedly bragged that he opposed in advance the U.S. military actions Iraq and Libya, I can't recall his bragging about his early opposition to the Afghan war. (I think he mentioned this one time.) In light of his change of heart, Trump's foes in the media, who love to point out flip-flops, would surely be pointing this out if it were true.

Beyond this, Trump's position is a tangled mess. He presents what is now his war as a matter of national security: his toy soldiers will be killing ""terrorists"" who allegedly threaten America, not building a democracy or telling the Afghans how to live. Leave aside the fact that killing alleged terrorists creates even more of them, as many military people recognize. Graeme Wood writes, ""On September 11, 2001, al Qaeda commanded an army of 400. A decade and a half later, the Islamic State (or ISIS) had mobilized some 40,000 people to travel to Iraq and Syria."" There was no ISIS in Afghanistan in 2001.

The national-security state is a perpetual motion machine, which is fine with most politicians, the military bureaucracy, and its contractors.

Yet while Trump says Afghanistan is about national security, he also says:

America will work with the Afghan government as long as we see determination and progress. However, our commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check. The government of Afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden. The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results. Our patience is not unlimited. [Emphasis added.]

If the U.S. occupation is, as Trump insists, a matter of self-defense, how can this be? If the Afghan government fails to fulfill his requirements, will he end the war and withdraw? How could he do that in light of his national-security premise? Maybe he's hinting he would overthrow the government and install a more cooperative one. Now we're back to regime-change and nation-building. This certainly sounds like nation-building after all: ""We want [India] to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development."" (Emphasis added.)

A related problem is Trump's stance that the U.S. government will not attempt to create a democracy in Afghanistan. Trump ignores that the democracy-builders make a national-security argument for their cause (which is not to say the argument is correct): a democracy, they say, would be less likely to harbor terrorists who seek to attack Americans. Trump surely cannot believe the political environment in Afghanistan is irrelevant to his security concerns. If he believes it is relevant and yet has no interest in promoting democracy there, doesn't it follow that he would prefer that a friendly authoritarian leader capable of crushing terrorists? It seems so. And we know what authoritarians do to their own populations.

The problem with Trump's case is his premise that Americans are threatened from any country that could be a safe haven for purported terrorists. Contrary to the official narrative, militant Islamists want revenge for decades of U.S. crimes against Muslims. (Civilian casualties are skyrocketing in several countries the U.S. government is bombing.) That's why Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda in Afghanistan did what it did on 9/11.

Moreover, much of the 9/11-attack planning occurred outside Afghanistan, including in the West. If Afghanistan, which the U.S. government helped to prepare for bin Laden by underwriting the guerilla war against the Soviet occupiers, had not been available, he would have found another place. In fact, the U.S. government has created havens for militant groups by destabilizing Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and Syria.

What is Trump's strategy for preventing anywhere in the world from becoming a safe haven? His working principle is hardly ""Come home, America.""

A far better way to keep Americans safe would be to stop killing Muslims and propping up repressive regimes (including Israel's) in the Muslim and Arab world -- in a word, liquidation of the American empire.

By the way, does Trump really think he can tell a terrorist in Afghanistan from an Afghan resisting the foreign occupation? He certainly can't tell a terrorist from a resistor to the savage U.S. occupation of the Philippines over a hundred years ago.

Also, how convenient for Trump to keep the American people in the dark about the details of his surge because it would tip off ""the enemy""? There's a handy argument against transparency in anything Trump sees in national-security terms.","[{'uri': 'sheldon_richman@reason.com', 'name': 'Sheldon Richman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Status quo'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Rumsfeld'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-building', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nation-building'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Militarism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Missouri'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Missouri'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Torture'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Honey'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Democracy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'National security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'George W.

The Fear of Another One Keeps It There.,"Killing terrorists is easy. Attaining peace requires hard work.

As the Trump administration was finalizing its Afghanistan strategy last week, the son of an Afghan governor-warlord was literally chewing on the ear of a provincial council member who threatened his father. Meanwhile, the country's vice president is abroad, having fled charges that he had a political rival dragged from a buzkashi match and sodomized.

In his recent address, President Donald Trump rightly disavowed nation-building in Afghanistan. The goals he announced -- preventing mass casualty attacks on America, eliminating Al Qaeda and ISIS, and preventing a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan -- are essentially the same pursued by the Obama administration. But he failed to make any mention of the political reforms necessary for the current system in Afghanistan to survive.

Afghanistan's domestic politics have taken a turn toward barbarism. And the post-Bonn framework that has kept Afghanistan together since 2001 is unraveling. The country's warlords, who donned tailored suits in the years after 9/11, fashioning themselves as statesmen, are reverting to their natural dispositions, bringing their country closer toward civil war. And on preventing this, President Trump had nothing to say.

The Taliban insurgency, as any map depicting insurgent control demonstrates, touches all corners of the country. It is easy to regurgitate boilerplate statements about insurgent safe havens in Pakistan. While the Afghan Taliban leadership is ensconced in Pakistan, the insurgency itself is now largely Afghanistan-based and controls large swaths of the country that do not border Pakistan. In these areas, it is the brutality of U.S.-backed militias that drives young men into the insurgency and forces locals to accept the Taliban as the lesser of many evils.

Obama's Afghanistan strategy involved a half-hearted surge whose enduring effect was the raising of the level of violence in Afghanistan, which continues unabated after the country was flooded with American weapons. Today, the Taliban are awash in American arms and vehicles, showing off their ""Made in America"" Humvees in their propaganda videos.

Last night, President Trump asserted: ""We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists."" But in Afghanistan, killing is the easy part. It's been going on for over three decades. It is attaining peace -- a durable peace that includes power brokers currently invested in the Western-backed system and a critical mass of insurgents -- that requires hard work.

Political indicators in Afghanistan are disconcerting. A peace deal secured last year between Kabul and insurgent leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was hailed as a potential model for peace with the Taliban. But his return to Kabul has reignited ethnic tensions between Pashtuns and non-Pashtuns that never went way and have been brewing since the contentious 2014 elections. Hekmatyar has busied himself by serving as President Ashraf Ghani's pitbull, advocating a strong central government and excoriating non-Pashtun power brokers.

President Ghani has failed to meet his end of the power sharing deal with Chief Executive Abdullah brokered by then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Parliamentary elections are already two years late. Rescheduled for next year, they and the presidential polls slated for 2019 are likely to exacerbate, not heal Afghanistan's ethnic wounds. Like previous elections, their validity will be questioned. And the underlying theme will be whether Afghanistan should have a strong, Pashtun-dominated central government, or a form of federalism that devolves power to the provinces -- i.e. ethnic strongholds.

It is 9/11 that brought America to Afghanistan. And it is the fear of another 9/11 that forces America to stay. But the United States has the luxury of physical distance from the landlocked, chaotic country. It is a luxury that Afghanistan's neighbors do not possess. What happens in Afghanistan does not stay in Afghanistan, as the millions of refugees who have lived in Pakistan and Iran for the past three decades attest.

Save for Pakistan, Trump made no mention of Afghanistan's other neighbors, including China and Iran. China not only shares a physical border with Afghanistan, but it invested in the four-way dialogue process that was to pave the way for talks with the Taliban. It has hosted Afghan Taliban emissaries. And it could make substantial investments in Afghanistan as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.","[{'uri': 'arif_rafiq@nationalinterest.org', 'name': 'Arif Rafiq', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzkashi', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Buzkashi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Gulbuddin Hekmatyar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Warlord'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Militia'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Civil war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sodomy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtuns', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pashtuns'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humvee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humvee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Federalism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Propaganda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'John Kerry'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}]",http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/rsz_2017-08-21t152820z_658093321_rc123143c2f0_rtrmadp_3_usa-trump-afghanistan.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.2862745098039216,241574400,1,nationalinterest.org,news,The National Interest,Donald Trump Taliban Insurgency Afghanistan Terrorism Pakistan Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Buzkashi Gulbuddin Hekmatyar Warlord Taliban insurgency Militia Civil war Sodomy Presidency of Barack Obama Al-Qaeda Kabul United States Ashraf Ghani Pashtuns Humvee Federalism Propaganda United States Secretary of State John Kerry Refugee Iran China,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,28,0,0,2017-08-28

The president's original instinct, expressed repeatedly over the years, was to pull any remaining troops out of Afghanistan. The American public is understandably tired of America's longest war that has dragged on for nearly 16 years. There are no good military options in sight.

Yet after a policy review that dragged on for seven months and bitterly divided the White House, the president finally faced up to grim reality: A full retreat from Afghanistan meant al-Qaeda and ISIS would find havens again as the Taliban seized more swaths of the country.

So Trump finally went with the advice of his generals, including National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, to boost the current 4,000 troops by a rumored 4,000 (some of the brass wanted more).

Shifts in direction

Needless to say, those numbers alone don't offer promise of reversing the current Taliban resurgence. But Trump's new policy, while vague and marked by some glaring holes, contained several shifts in direction that could make a difference on the ground.

Let's call those directional shifts the four Nos.

The first No is no deadline for troop withdrawal. President Obama made a huge error when he surged troops in Afghanistan in 2009 but announced in advance the date for their pullout. The Taliban just waited him out, as did Afghanistan's mischief-making neighbor Pakistan (see below).

Given the small number of U.S. troops - and their primary role as trainers - it makes more sense to see their presence as part of a long-term investment in order to prevent a terrorist resurgence. Their presence also reminds regional neighbors Iran, Russia, India and Pakistan that America is still paying attention.

The second No refers to no more efforts at nation-building. We tried that and failed.

The few thousand remaining U.S. troops will focus on training Afghan special operations forces and commandos, and, learning from lessons in Iraq, on calling in air and artillery strikes to support Afghans. This is how a limited number of U.S. troops helped the Iraqi army finally defeat ISIS in Mosul.

The third No is the apparent veto of a bizarre idea that the president toyed with: to hire Eric Prince, founder of the notorious Blackwater private contractor outfit that shot up Baghdad, to lead a mercenary force replacing U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

Most important is the fourth No: No more havens for Afghan Taliban in Pakistan. The Pakistani military and intelligence services have long played a double game, warring on Pakistani Taliban that attack their own military and civilians while giving safe haven to Afghan Taliban leaders and fighters. The Pakistanis have also hosted other Islamist terrorists that attack India, and, harbored Osama bin Laden for years.

Islamabad plays this double game because it views the Afghan Taliban and other terrorist groups as vital tools in its endless struggle against India. Both the Bush and Obama administrations tried fruitlessly to persuade Pakistan with financial carrots to shut down these terrorist safe havens.

McMaster is known to have sought a tougher line on Pakistan. And Trump proclaimed, ""We can no longer be silent"" about Pakistani safe havens for terrorists. The success of any Trump policy on Afghanistan may depend on whether his team can figure out how to change Pakistan's behavior.

Which brings me to the big holes in Trump's ""strategy.""

The president paid lip service to diplomacy, saying his policy would ""integrate all instruments of American power."" But the troubled State Department has been denuded of expertise on South Asia, and the president's words made clear his skepticism about diplomatic efforts.

'Outright victory'

Trump repeatedly promised to ""win"" in Afghanistan and called for ""outright victory."" Afghanistan's history shows that ""victory"" within its borders is a dubious hope.

Ultimately, the point of military progress in Afghanistan would be to provide muscle behind a diplomatic push in the region - aimed at persuading all of Afghanistan's neighbors that its stability was in their interests and they should stop backing factions on its soil.

Afghanistan is Trump's war now, and it will require the kind of long-range thinking he hasn't demonstrated up until now.
