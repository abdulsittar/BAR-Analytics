A UN agency in Afghanistan made a bold statement on International Women's Day by blacking out all of the photos on its website and replacing them with four words: #WhereAreTheWomen.

The move is meant to call attention to Afghan women's fear of appearing in public spaces or in photographs, Rob Few, a spokesperson for the U.N. Development Program in Kabul, told The Huffington Post.

""Women are scared of what will happen if they appear in public,"" Few said.

The detainees are being questioned and more information will be shared with media, but it is not known if high-profile (Taliban) leaders are among them, security officials told VOA Thursday on condition of anonymity.

The officials said law enforcement agencies, acting on a tip, picked up the men from the city's eastern Pashtoonabad area, which houses mostly Afghan refugees.

""We have also seized important maps and documents about sensitive places and installations in the province,"" they added, without sharing more details.

Government officials did not immediately comment on the arrests in Quetta.

Peace talk delays

PeacePakistan was supposed to host peace talks between Taliban and Afghan government officials in the first week of March, but, in a last-minute announcement, the insurgent group refused to attend the meeting, citing certain pre-conditions.

Earlier, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nafees Zakaria, at his weekly news conference in Islamabad, reiterated Pakistan's commitment to promoting the Afghan peace efforts.

""It has been our consistent position that a political negotiated settlement is the most viable option for bringing lasting peace to Afghanistan. We will continue to play our positive role in this regard,"" he said

The Taliban leadership is believed to be sheltering and directing the Afghan insurgency from areas in and around Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, which shares a border with Afghanistan.

For years, Pakistan rejected Afghan and U.S. assertions that Taliban insurgents are using Pakistani soil for their insurgent activities.

Taliban leaders in Pakistan

Last week, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's adviser on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz, for the first time, publicly admitted that Taliban leaders are present in Pakistan and that leverage can be used to push them to the negotiating table for talks with the Afghan government.

""We have some influence on them because their leadership is in Pakistan, and they get some medical facilities; their families are here. So we can use those levers to pressurize them to say, 'Come to the table,'"" Aziz said at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.

Afghan officials say Pakistan has assured a four-nation contact group, which includes China and the United States, that Islamabad will take action against Taliban insurgents on its soil who oppose political reconciliation with Kabul and want to continue with their violent campaign in Afghanistan.","[{'uri': 'ayaz_gul@voanews.com', 'name': 'Ayaz Gul', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_refugees', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan refugees'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Voice of America'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Balochistan, Pakistan'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sartaj_Aziz', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sartaj Aziz'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nawaz Sharif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Council on Foreign Relations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}]",http://gdb.voanews.com/B66DBC97-9F67-491D-BA88-FE7A88D45EAC_mw1024_mh1024_s.png,eng-2000634,0.2156862745098038,195315720,1,voanews.com,news,VOA Voice of America,"Taliban Quetta Pakistan Insurgency Afghanistan Afghan refugees Voice of America Politics of Afghanistan Taliban insurgency Balochistan, Pakistan Sartaj Aziz Nawaz Sharif Islamabad Council on Foreign Relations Kabul China",United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2016,3,10,22,14,2016-03-10

This includes the efforts of the Soviet Union in the '80s, as well as those of the British Empire during the 19th century, and their forced withdrawal after losing what seemed at first an easy victory. The American news network CNN concluded [in recent coverage] by saying, ""Indeed, the American forces now know that the Taliban are playing a game of time with them.""*

Days before the war was undertaken by the United States against the Taliban in Afghanistan -- which would cost the American taxpayers $3 billion, in addition to the dread experienced by the international forces there, as well as by the Afghan citizens due to Taliban attacks -- CNN aired a report begging the question, ""What is achieved by fighting the war against this organization?!"" The channel also said in its presentation that the losses suffered by Western forces include the deaths of 3,500 soldiers. In addition, tens of thousands of Afghanis have died during the years of the war, which began in 2001. Further, last week, the Afghan forces withdrew from two locations in the Helmand Province, Lashkar Gah and Sangin, giving the Taliban the opportunity to impose its control over the remainder of the province.

The former Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan in 1978, but it faced fierce opposition from what are known as the Afghan Mujahedeen, as well as the Arab Mujahedeen, who joined them in what is known as a jihad against the Soviet occupation. These fighters succeeded, as they were supported by U.S. intelligence as well as financially supported by the governments of some Arab countries, which also encouraged young people to emigrate and join the ranks of the Mujahedeen. In the end, Soviet troops were forced to withdraw from Afghanistan. After the withdrawal, fighting between yesterday's allies within the Mujahedeen, as well as between parties, dominates the chaos in Afghanistan today. It was in this atmosphere that the Taliban emerged as students of the Sharia led by Mullah Muhammad Omar and quickly took control over vast areas of Afghanistan, including the capital, Kabul, where they proclaimed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Among the Arab fighters in the Afghan ranks was Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, who had moved there after leaving Sudan.

The movement has persisted in Afghanistan but has not been recognized, except by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, which later withdrew their recognition following the Sept.11, 2001attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center towers in New York. The U.S. president at the time, George Bush, demanded that the Taliban government hand over bin Laden and al-Qaida, claiming that they launched the attacks on the United States. Mullah Omar, the leader of the movement, demanded that the U.S. government provide proof of bin Laden's involvement. The U.S. response in October 2001 was to bomb and attack Afghanistan, as well as the formation of an international coalition in order to oust the Taliban government, which has since been achieved.

However, the Taliban has not kept quiet. Rather, it has been fighting the U.S. forces, the coalition, as well as the Afghan government set up by the U.S. and international forces. The fighting continues today. The fact is that Taliban forces have become a major threat and are making progress in many areas; they are adept at hit-and-run operations and are familiar with the mountainous nature of Afghanistan. Therefore, their operations are diverse against the occupying forces and the Afghan government, and many deaths are to be expected given the repeated attacks on U.S. bases. Thus, imposed upon the U.S. and the Afghan government are negotiations with the Taliban in order to reach a consensual solution, which would make the movement a partner in the Afghan government, thus recognizing its strength. This is a matter that is being exploited and maneuvered by the movement. It recognizes the extent of the weakness of the Afghan government and its forces. It knows very well that the survival of the Afghan government is dependent on continued U.S. support and the presence of NATO forces.

However, in recent years, the participating countries in the U.S-led .coalition have begun to announce the withdrawal of their troops. The result is clear: All of the years of war have not been able to eliminate the Taliban, as the U.S. had once predicted. The knowledge of the imminent withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan is something that increases the strength of the Taliban, and the decision to pounce on the current Afghan government has been made and will occur immediately after the withdrawal of those forces. This also pushes the Obama administration to work to escape from the quagmire of Afghanistan.

There are meetings from time to time between officials of the Afghan government and the Taliban in the Qatari capital, Doha, in order to reach a settlement. However, until now, there have been no serious and genuine negotiations between the two parties. In order to reach a settlement, the U.S. is paying in American lives for a face-saving way out of Afghanistan. This means an announcement of their miserable failure in achieving their goals of invading Afghanistan, the elimination of al-Qaida, and the elimination of the Taliban. However, the Taliban has remained and has become stronger since the beginning. Likewise, al-Qaida has remained, branched out, and has had an unprecedented spread not only within Afghanistan, but also into other Arab areas and organizations, such as the Islamic State, al-Nusra Front, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, Boko Haram and others. The U.S. policy failures and losses are evidenced by the lives lost by the occupying forces, the Afghan forces, and others, as well as by the number of those wounded and injured due to the war. Additionally, the billions that have been spent for the sake of winning the war in vain also evidence U.S. failure, as well as the image of the U.S. as a superpower with the strongest marine fleets, armies, and marine bases around the world that could not achieve its goals in Afghanistan. To defeat all of this and triumph, the militants must not be carrying simple, but unconventional weapons. America bites its fingers furiously over all that was spent and suffered in vain.

Campbell, who recently stepped down as commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, at a news conference at in Kabul, Afghanistan. (Omar Sobhani/Pool Photo via AP)

The outgoing commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan pressed civilian leaders in the months before he left Kabul to expand the American role there, shedding light on what he called a slow and inefficient decision-making process as he prepares to retire.

Gen. John F. Campbell declined to detail the recommendations he had made to senior leaders before he stepped down earlier this month, but suggested that the United States may need to expand advisory missions with Afghan ground troops and take additional actions against the Taliban, which is seeking to expand attacks against local forces.

""If you want to have pressure, if you want to drive [the Taliban] toward reconciliation ... I would believe they need to have more pressure put on them,"" Campbell said. ""One way to do it would be potentially striking.""

""Now, I'm not advocating for 'Let's go back and be committed to a total war against the Taliban' ... but that is one way to go after them,"" he said. He declined to provide additional details about the nature of his proposed actions against the group.

Campbell, who spoke to reporters at the Pentagon about his nearly 37 years in the U.S. Army and his tenure as the top American general in Afghanistan, hangs up his uniform as the U.S. military grapples with a sharp deterioration in security across Afghanistan, where Taliban and other militants are seeking to expand gains against local forces.

The modest U.S. force of 9,800 troops is now assigned to a dual mission, advising local forces and conducting counter-terrorism operations against al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. Under a plan announced by President Obama in 2014, that force is due to be reduced to just 5,500 servicemembers by early next year.

Campbell expressed satisfaction at a series of White House decisions over the past year and a half that allowed him to adjust the U.S. mission to reflect both the ongoing weaknesses of Afghanistan's military, and the continued strength of the Taliban. He cited a series of steps approved by Obama since fall 2014, including authorization of certain combat activities; permission to strike the Islamic State's Afghanistan cell; and several moves to retain a larger U.S. force for more time.

But the general also voiced frustration at what he characterized as a painfully slow process chaired by the White House, which he said would often review potential actions in repeated meetings. Campbell said he sat in on so-called deputy-level, or sub-Cabinet, meetings, Cabinet-level meetings and full National Security Council meetings, often late into the night as he tuned in from Afghanistan.

""There were times I would say why are we going over this again - I've already laid it out."" But, Campbell said, ""every time I got to President Obama I got the decision I was really looking for.""

""The frustration was just the process we have but ... it was kind of good and bad at the same time,"" he said.

Campbell suggested that his successor, Gen. John ""Mick"" Nicholson, might take up the case for his pending military recommendations.

""I think sort of the same things I asked for ... again I don't want to speak for him, but I think he'd probably reemphasize those,"" he said. ""But I want to make sure we can get them done in a timely manner. Otherwise it's not going to impact [2016]"" he said.

Campbell said Afghan forces continue to lack basic military functions - intelligence, logistics, and air power - but had proved themselves a capable fighting force.

Campbell said the Obama administration had offered him a chance following his Afghanistan position to become the next head of U.S. Africa Command; its commander Gen. David M. Rodriguez is stepping down later this year. But Campbell said he declined for personal reasons.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Campbell_(general)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'John F.

Army Gen. John Campbell, who stepped down as commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan last week, said he has been encouraged by the Afghan forces' improvements over time.

Still, Campbell said he is concerned about shortcomings such as a general reluctance to leave checkpoints and go on the offensive against Taliban fighters, who often are outgunned.

""It will be a very, very tough year for the Afghans unless they"" make changes such as taking a more offensive approach on the battlefield and improving the quality of their military leaders, Campbell said in an interview with reporters at the Pentagon.

The Afghan forces took heavy losses last year, which was their first full year of fighting without U.S. troops in combat alongside them.

Campbell gave up command in Afghanistan on Mar. 2 and is due to retire from the Army on May 1. His successor is Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr.

Campbell, a U.S. Military Academy graduate who has served in uniform for nearly 37 years, said he turned down an offer from Defense Secretary Ash Carter to be nominated as the next commander of U.S. Africa Command. He called it a personal decision.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Associated Press'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Security Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International Security Assistance Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'The Pentagon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Carter', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ash Carter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Nicholson_Jr.', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'John W.

The Afghan air force will not reach necessary strength levels until 2020, according to a top U.S. general.

General John Campbell, who ended his command of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan last week, told reporters Friday that some aircraft procured for the force would not arrive in Afghanistan until 2018.

The force would then need an additional two to three years to train the pilots needed for the new aircraft, he explained.

""2020 is probably a good guess,"" Campbell said.

Afghan aviation capabilities saw significant progress in the 18 months in which the general led international forces there, although, he said, the United States ""started way too late"" in developing the nation's air force.

For example, in 2014, the Afghan air force conducted 85 aerial support missions; in 2015, that number increased to 4,485.

Future improvements

The force will double the number of A-29 turboprop attack aircraft in the next couple of weeks, according to Campbell. It will also add eight to 10 MD-530 armed helicopters -- which the general referred to as ""little birds"" -- to the Afghan air arsenal this fighting season.

""Those have made a difference in Nangahar, in Helmand,"" he said.

However, the United States and NATO must still build, train and advise Afghan attack controllers needed to direct the action of their combat aircraft during offensive operations.

These controllers are required to positively identify targets and help prevent civilian casualties.","[{'uri': 'carla_babb@voanews.com', 'name': 'Carla Babb', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Air_Force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan Air Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Air force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Aircraft'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmand_Province', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Helmand Province'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Helmand Province'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Aviation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_EMB_314_Super_Tucano', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Turboprop'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_aircraft', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Attack aircraft'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Helicopter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aircraft', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Military aircraft'}}]",http://gdb.voanews.com/E5D2E487-CFDF-47E4-8F0D-60F54DFD3725_cx0_cy9_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg,eng-2000634,0.05098039215686279,195440760,1,voanews.com,news,VOA Voice of America,Afghanistan Afghan Air Force Air force United States Armed Forces Aircraft Helmand Province NATO Aviation Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano Turboprop Attack aircraft Helicopter Military aircraft,United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,69.0,29.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,16.0,29.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,40.0,91.0,62.0,46.0,26.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2016,3,12,6,1,2016-03-12
