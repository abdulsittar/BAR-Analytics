Former US president Donald Trump on Saturday raised the stakes of next year's US presidential election as he said he was the only candidate who could save the country from ""warmonger"" Democrats and the ""zealots and fools"" of the mainstream Republican Party.

Darkly invoking a nation on its knees, Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, that Americans were ""in an epic struggle to rescue our country from the people who hate it and want to absolutely destroy it.""

""We had a Republican Party that was ruled by freaks, neocons, globalists, open border zealots and fools,"" he said, singling out multiple luminaries of the party by name.

Voters are tired of ""entrenched political dynasties in both parties, rotten special interests, China-loving politicians"" and supporters of ""endless foreign wars,"" Trump said.

""We're going to have Word War III if something doesn't happen fast,"" he said in a section voicing disapproval for US aid to Ukraine. ""I am the only candidate who can make this promise: I will prevent World War III.""

Trump spoke for about one hour and 40 minutes to close out the four-day CPAC, a short hop down the Potomac River from the nation's capital, Washington.

The annual CPAC was until recently the premier gathering of conservative thought leaders in in the US, but it has been swallowed whole by Trump's far-right ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) movement, with pundits referring to the event as ""MAGApalooza.""

""We are going to finish what we started,"" Trump said as he took to the stage, prompting a chant of ""Four more years, four more years.""

This year's edition featured speeches from some of the country's most committed Trump supporters, as well as former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, although many potential candidates in next year's election and Republican leadership skipped the convention.

The meeting drew smaller crowds than usual, raising questions over its continued relevance as many speeches played to empty rows of seating.

However, the room was packed when Trump made his case for a second term, as he faces accusations of trying to steal the 2020 election through a multi-step criminal conspiracy that included inciting an insurrection.

For the most part, he rehearsed the same litany of voter fraud conspiracy theories and grievances against law enforcement and ""radical left"" prosecutors that he dusts off for every post-presidency public appearance.

The address offered a split screen with the conservative Club for Growth's donor retreat in Florida, where much of the Republican establishment had decamped for the weekend.

At CPAC, vendors hawked books, dating apps and even WiFi services specifically marketed for conservatives. The hats, flags, mugs and other merchandise on offer was almost exclusively aimed at the MAGA faithful.

A line-up of panelists who took the stage before Trump's address unleashed an avalanche of conspiracy theories and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric as speakers boasted their Christian principles.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former US vice president Mike Pence, who lead the pack chasing Trump, skipped the event, avoiding the humiliation of being booed by the former president's fans.

Before Trump took to the stage, it was revealed that he had won the convention's straw poll of potential Republican leaders with 62 percent of the vote -- with DeSantis a distant second at 20 percent.

Trump mentioned neither by name, confounding analysts' expectations for attacks targeting both. However delegates repeatedly heckled his only declared Republican rival, former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, during and after her appearance at the convention on Friday.

Former White House chief strategist and senior counselor to the US president Steve Bannon and celebrity Trump ally Mike Lindell were treated like royalty as they walked the halls of the National Harbor convention center, preaching election denialism.

""It's not going to be a fair election,"" Lindell said. ""But when 90 percent of the people in this country want Donald Trump, he should win anyway, even with the crooked elections.""",[],"[{'uri':
