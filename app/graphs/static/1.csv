US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has warned that Pakistan could lose its status as a privileged military ally if Islamabad does not change its approach towards insurgents enjoying safe havens in the country.

""We are going to be conditioning our support for Pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area. We want to work with Pakistan in a positive way, but they must change their approach,"" Tillerson said.

This new development takes place a day after US President Donald Trump announced his new war strategy on Afghanistan which includes the deployment of additional US troops and efforts to force a resurgent Taliban to negotiate a political settlement with the government in Kabul.

Tillerson said that the Trump administration was considering many options on Pakistan including a complete termination of financial aid to Pakistan as a non-NATO ally.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government has expressed concerns over the tense relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Tillerson said that those who are threatening the US interests will be targeted anywhere.

""We are going to attack terrorists wherever they live, and we have put people on notice that if you are harboring and providing safe havens to terrorists, be warned. Be forewarned. And we're going to engage with those who are providing safe havens and ask them to change what they're doing and help us help them,"" said Tillerson.

""Well, I think it's - obviously, we have some leverage that's been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as a non-NATO alliance partner. All of that can be put on the table,"" added Tillerson.

""China is deeply concerned about tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, we believe that friendly relations between the two countries are not only in their own interests, but in the interests of the region,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying.

Despite the ups and downs in relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani once again invited Pakistan to make peace with Afghanistan.

In an address to the Afghan people on Wednesday, Ghani said now was the time for Pakistan to change its approach and that Afghanistan has never taken steps to destabilize Pakistan.

""We want to say it clearly that appropriate ground should be paved to settle the issues through negotiations instead of engaging in decades of wars,"" said Ghani.

According to Tillerson, officials in Washington have directly talked about the US's concerns with the Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, but time will tell whether Pakistan changes its behavior - that has been ongoing for years.","[{'uri': 'karim_amini@tolonews.com', 'name': 'Karim Amini', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"", 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Prime Minister of Pakistan'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}]",http://www.tolonews.com/sites/default/files/pakistan-23.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.1529411764705882,241187220,1,tolonews.com,news,TOLOnews,"Rex Tillerson Pakistan China Afghanistan United States Secretary of State Presidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump Taliban Insurgency Terrorism Islamabad Kabul Demographics of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China President of Afghanistan Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Prime Minister of Pakistan Washington, D.C.",Afghanistan,AF,,,,,,C8,Asia,AS,Muslim,164.0,166.0,148.0,149.0,166.0,154.0,139.0,159.0,152.0,153.0,153.0,157.0,155.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,23,27,12,2017-08-23

Afghans have welcomed the US's new strategy and said they support any plan which ensures peace and stability in the country.

Some did however say that the United States should be honest in its fight against insurgents.

""The policy is not prioritizing reconstruction. It only wants to eliminate terrorists,"" said Zekrullah Nazari, a resident of Nangarhar.

""It was the demand of all Afghans that Pakistan should be slammed and pressurized because of all the bad acts it has done to Afghanistan,"" said Nematullah Hamdard, a resident of Nangarhar.

In the northern province of Balkh, where Taliban militants are at war with government forces in some districts including Chamtal and Chahar Bolak, residents said the new US strategy was different and was a serious plan to eliminate terrorists.

""We hope that Pakistan and the US acts honestly in the fight against terrorism and delivers on the comment it has made in this respect,"" said Sharifullah, a resident of Balkh.

""The strategy has at least brought hope to Afghans that Pakistanis and terrorists are treated in a way that was not done before,"" said Abdulqader, another resident of the province.

Residents in Helmand, who have been hit hard by the war, said the strategy will pressurize Pakistan to stop helping terrorists.

""If the pressures are brought on Pakistan, it will push Pakistan to avoid giving sanctuary and training to terrorists,"" said Dost Mohammad, a resident of Lashkargah city.

""We hope that government and its international allies work for peace as well,"" said Jawad Dawari, a resident of Helmand.

Those in Kabul - who have had to deal with a spike in deadly attacks in recent times - said they support the US strategy but hope it eliminates insurgency in the country and in the region.

""We don't want war, we want peace,"" Kabul resident Farid said.

""We are happy and optimistic about the strategy and we demand and hope that terrorists should be eliminated,"" said Feda Mohammad, a Kabul resident.

US President Donald Trump early Tuesday announced his administration's new strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia.

He was expected to provide details on the exact number of troops which would be added to the forces already in Afghanistan but failed to do so. Instead, he said they will no longer disclose details about their war strategies.

Trump's decision was met with mixed reaction by regional countries. Pakistani analysts were not impressed by the new strategy but India welcomed it and reaffirmed its support to Afghanistan.

Meanwhile China said it stands by Pakistan. This was in line with Trump's remarks that the US would no longer tolerate safe havens for terrorists in Pakistan.","[{'uri': 'nabila_ashrafi@tolonews.com', 'name': 'Nabila Ashrafi', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOLOnews', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'TOLOnews'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_Province', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Nangarhar Province'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Nangarhar Province'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Province'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkh', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Balkh'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Balkh'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmand_Province', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Helmand Province'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Helmand Province'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkargah', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Lashkargah'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Lashkargah'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dost_Mohammad_Khan_(Emir_of_Afghanistan)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}]",http://www.tolonews.com/sites/default/files/Reaction%20English.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.07450980392156858,241203000,1,tolonews.com,news,TOLOnews,Terrorism Pakistan Afghanistan TOLOnews Nangarhar Province Province Balkh Helmand Province Taliban Insurgency Kabul Lashkargah Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan) Donald Trump South Asia India China,Afghanistan,AF,,,,,,C8,Asia,AS,Muslim,164.0,166.0,148.0,149.0,166.0,154.0,139.0,159.0,152.0,153.0,153.0,157.0,155.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,23,50,16,2017-08-23

At a meeting at the army's headquarters in Rawalpindi, Hale briefed Bajwa on US President Donald Trump's new strategy, according to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations -- the military's media wing.

In his announcement earlier this week Trump said: ""We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations.""

According to Dawn News, Bajwa said: ""We are not looking for any material or financial assistance from the US, but trust, understanding and [an] acknowledgement of our contributions.""

According to the ISPR statement, Bajwa highlighted the importance of peace in Afghanistan for Pakistan and highlighted the efforts made by Pakistan to that end.

Bajwa said collaboration between all stakeholders is the key to bringing the war in Afghanistan to an end, the ISPR statement said, reported Dawn News.

Hale told Bajwa that the US values Pakistan's role in the fight against terror and seeks the country's cooperation in resolving the Afghan issue, the statement added.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hale_(diplomat)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'David Hale (diplomat)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Javed_Bajwa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Qamar Javed Bajwa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Inter-Services Public Relations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_News', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Dawn News'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rawalpindi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Rawalpindi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}]",http://www.tolonews.com/sites/default/files/pakistan_3.jpg,eng-3382459,0.2,241241220,1,tolonews.com,news,TOLOnews,Donald Trump United States Pakistan David Hale (diplomat) Qamar Javed Bajwa Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan) Inter-Services Public Relations Dawn News Insurgency Rawalpindi Terrorism Afghanistan,Afghanistan,AF,,,,,,C8,Asia,AS,Muslim,164.0,166.0,148.0,149.0,166.0,154.0,139.0,159.0,152.0,153.0,153.0,157.0,155.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,27,3,2017-08-24

""As a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country. Instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens, the US needs to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism,"" the statement added.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan also added ""The threat to peace and security cannot be isolated from the complex interplay of geopolitics, continued existence of festering disputes and pursuit of hegemonic policies. Non-resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains the primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region.""

According to the statement ""Pakistan reiterates its view that there is no exclusive military solution to the crisis in Afghanistan.

""We support the new US strategy that committs to support the AFG people, continue to support ANDSF and speaking loud and clear about Pakistan'ss deceiving strategy supporting terrorist groups and offering them safe heavens. We will wait for implementation,"" he said in a Twitter post.

Nabil has long been criticizing the Pakistani military, specifically the Inter Services Intelligence for supporting the Afghan militant groups, including the notorious Haqqani terrorist network.

In one stance last year, Nabil also disclosed and published various classified documents of ISI regarding the role of the organization in supporting the Taliban and Haqqani network and plotting deadly attacks in Afghanistan.

The US President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled the new US strategy outlining the approaches for Afghanistan and South Asia as he harshly criticized Pakistan for harboring the terrorist groups besides he vowed continued support to Afghanistan and war against terrorism.

Zalmay Khalilzad, former US ambassador to Afghanistan, said this week in an article published by the New York Times that unlike his two predecessors in the Oval Office, US President Donald Trump has chosen to address the fact that Pakistan has been playing a double game.

Khalilzad said Trump ""unequivocally called out Pakistan for pretending to be a partner and receiving large-scale American assistance while providing sanctuary and support for the Taliban and the Haqqani terrorist network, which have been killing Americans and Afghans.""

He said that Trump's announcement of a change in American policy implies that the US will end its support and assistance for Pakistan and that Trump signaled that deference to Pakistani sensitivities will no longer prevent the US from developing a stronger strategic partnership with India.

Khalilzad said Trump deserves high marks for his new Afghanistan strategy. ""It is bold, reasoned and offers the prospect of success against the violent Islamist groups of the region. But it will also face opposition in the region. The president will have to show an unflagging commitment to the cause and be prepared to respond to moves by adversaries to disrupt his plan.""

He stated that Trump recognizes that abandoning Afghanistan would allow safe havens for international terrorist organizations to emerge once more.

""The new strategy is not only comprehensive but also a major evolution in American policy. Though he did not specify numbers, the president indicated that he will deploy a surge of United States forces, without any timeline for their withdrawal -- the error of the Obama administration,"" Khalilzad said.

He went on to say that another major change from the Obama era is Trump's decision to give American commanders in the field the flexibility they've long sought in assisting the Afghan forces fighting the Taliban and other insurgents. ""The president also adopted a realistic position regarding peace talks, moving away from (former) president Barack Obama's pursuit of reconciliation regardless of the deteriorating military situation.""

But Khalilzad stated that for Trump to realize his aims, he must focus on three crucial areas of action. ""First, the military surge must be accompanied by a strong diplomatic push to coordinate the new effort. The president could put the United States ambassador in Kabul or the NATO commander in charge, but the best approach would be to appoint a presidential envoy. A key task for this representative would be to work with Afghan leaders to ensure that they deliver on their commitments to reform and economic development.

""Second, the president must be ready for Pakistan to resist and test his resolve. This might come in the form of attacks on American assets in Afghanistan or of interference with supply routes across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Pakistan's security apparatus will try to prove that the United States cannot succeed without cooperating on Islamabad's terms.

Khalilzad also said the US should impose sanctions against senior officials in the Pakistani military and intelligence services who play a direct role in supporting terrorists and extremists. Washington should also suspend all American aid to Pakistan and use its influence with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to do the same, he said.

""It should begin a security assessment that would put Pakistan on the list of states that sponsor terrorist groups. Finally, the United States should conduct strikes against terrorist hide-outs in Pakistan,"" he stated adding that ""the Trump administration should make clear to Islamabad that it would be willing to reverse these moves and repair relations -- but only after Pakistan has demonstrated a change in conduct that has the clear result of diminished violence in Afghanistan.""

The president's third course of action must be to give Afghanistan's leaders an incentive to work with the US and improve the country's governance, particularly in its security institutions.

""To win in Afghanistan, as the president wishes to do, will require the cooperation of Afghan society and a commitment by the country's main political groups to national, rather than parochial, goals. Afghan society, particularly its young people, are our best allies. The United States must find ways to help unlock that potential.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmay_Khalilzad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Zalmay Khalilzad'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Oval Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The New York Times'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Durand Line'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'World Bank'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International sanctions'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International Monetary Fund'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Intelligence agency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}]",http://www.tolonews.com/sites/default/files/zalmai-khalilzad.jpg,eng-3382459,0.1450980392156862,241282320,1,tolonews.com,news,TOLOnews,"Zalmay Khalilzad Donald Trump Pakistan Afghanistan Taliban Terrorism Oval Office Presidency of Barack Obama Islamism The New York Times Barack Obama India Afghan Armed Forces Durand Line Pakistan Armed Forces World Bank NATO Insurgency International sanctions International Monetary Fund Intelligence agency Washington, D.C.

US fighter pilots in Afghanistan are preparing for more air attacks after President Donald Trump announced his new war strategy last week, Reuters reported.

In his speech, Trump said the US will increase the air campaign against Taliban insurgents.

Trump reiterated that the US would ultimately win the war.

Reuters reported that few details have emerged, but pilots at Bagram airbase outside Kabul are preparing for the possibility they'll be taking the fight to the Taliban in a way they haven't since the US-led combat mission in Afghanistan was called off at the end of 2014.

Among their targets since then have been Daesh.

""Between the two groups, the Taliban are definitely smarter,"" F-16 pilot Maj. Daniel Lindsey told Reuters. ""The Taliban are much harder to kill.""

""The Taliban is often embedded in the community, but nobody likes the Islamic State (Daesh), so they are often separate,"" Lindsey said.

According to Reuters, the commander of US troops in Afghanistan Gen. John Nicholson then said he would ramp up security for all troops.

He told Reuters ""we know the enemy fears air power"".

The report stated that the US air strikes in Afghanistan drastically increased from 1,074 in January to 2,244 by the end of August.

In his speech, Trump did not however disclose how many additional troops would be sent to Afghanistan.

Addressing a press conference on Thursday however, Nicholson said: ""We will not fail in Afghanistan. Our national security depends on that as well.""

Nicholson said that the Taliban cannot win on the battlefield. ""It's time for them to join the peace process.""

""Afghan people want peace and the international community are with you in that journey - it's a shared vision we can all work towards,"" he said.

Nicholson said that the US forces and NATO Resolute Support Mission will increase train, advise, assist efforts in Afghanistan and more advisors from the US and NATO means enhancing training at military schools and growing the Afghan Air Force and Special Forces.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Reuters'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOLOnews', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'TOLOnews'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagram_Airfield', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bagram Airfield'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_warfare', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Aerial warfare'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Nicholson_Jr.', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'John W.

Pakistan's Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal quoted by the local newspaper, The News, said ""Nadra has conducted a departmental inquiry to unearth its officials' involvement in issuance of a fake CNIC to Mullah Mansoor Akhtar with the name of Muhammad Wali s/o Shah Muhammad.""

Iqbal further added ""As per recommendations, Deputy Assistant Director, Karachi, Faisaluddin was removed from service as major penalty.""

The latest findings further supports the claims against certain circles and officials in Pakistan for supporting the ongoing insurgency in Afghanistan by providing shelters and forms of support to the Taliban and the notorious Haqqani terrorist network.

The Afghan officials have long been insisting that the leadership councils of the Taliban and the Haqqani terrorist network are based in the key cities of Pakistan from where they plan and coordinate deadly attacks in Afghanistan.

In the meantime, the US President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled the new US strategy outlining the approaches for Afghanistan and South Asia as he harshly criticized Pakistan for harboring the terrorist groups besides he vowed continued support to Afghanistan and war against terrorism.

President Trump said ""For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror.

John Nicholson said the issue of sanctuaries outside the country was serious and has to be addressed.

In a special interview with TOLOnews, Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of US Forces and NATO in Afghanistan, said on Saturday that the US knows the Afghan Taliban leadership is in the Quetta and Peshawar areas.

He said the issue of outside sanctuaries has to be addressed but that it was ""being addressed in private between the US government and the Pakistani government - but it does need to be addressed.""

""Support for terrorists and insurgents has to be reduced, has to be stopped,"" said Nicholson.

On whether a diplomatic solution could be found, he said this was a possibility but that a significant military effort inside the country would be carried out and that together the US would work with the Afghan government to increase its military capabilities.

""I am primarily focused on activities inside Afghanistan,"" but other officials are looking into the issue of sanctuaries in Pakistan, he said.

According to him, the issue of sanctuaries was a serious one and one that needed to be addressed.

""The Quetta Shura, Peshawar Shura, these shuras are identified by cities inside Pakistan, we know Afghan Taliban leaders are in these areas,"" he said.

Specifically asked whether the Taliban leadership in Quetta and Pashawar and other major Pakistan cities ""shouldn't sleep in peace from now on"", he said ""I won't put words in the (US) president's mouth but he definitely conveyed this message.""

He said that following US President Donald Trump's announcement earlier this week on his new war strategy, he, Nicholson, as a commander, has a new policy - ""one based on conditions and not time.""

He said: ""It gives us additional capabilities. We have a direction now provided by the US policy that is being supported by NATO.""

On the issue of general security in Afghanistan, Nicholson said the ""civilian casualties is a real tragedy"".

""The Taliban cause the vast majority of civilian casualties and even though they have stated that it is their objective to reduce civilian casualties they have in fact increased civilian casualties. This is one of the points that we need to put on the table with the Taliban. They are not acting in the best interests of the Afghan people.

""We know the Taliban receives the majority of its financing from narcotics traffic,"" he said adding that the organization has become a group that brings misery and hardship to the people.

Asked if he sees the Taliban as a terrorist organization, Nicholson said: ""They do terrorist activities and they enable terrorists.""

As an example he pointed to the Taliban links in the past to al-Qaeda.

On whether he had a mandate to go out and kill the Taliban, Nicholson said: ""It is our mandate to put military pressure on the Taliban.

However, he said that the US wants a peaceful solution in Afghanistan but that the ""Taliban need to know they cannot win militarily."" He said he hopes they enter the peace process.

""In the meantime we will put increasing pressure on them inside the country and on the external sanctuaries.""

In terms of developing the military, he said the special forces will be doubled and with the growth of the Afghan air force the Taliban will lose. He said these special forces' commandos have never lost a battle against the Taliban and with an expanded force they will retake the majority of territory either outside government's control or territory that is being contested.

He said as these forces expand their control, coupled with pressure on external sanctuaries, the Taliban will get to a point where it realizes it cannot win militarily and will have to enter into a reconciliation process.

In terms of security leadership and the high turnover of defense and interior ministers, Nicholson said the issue of leadership is an important one but gave credit to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani who changed leaders this summer. Nicholson said however that corruption was still a problem - particularly that relating to fuel contracts and personnel.

By spring of next year every soldier and every police officer will be biometrically registered, he said.

On the fuel contract issue he said these contracts have been pulled back in under the US forces' control in order to cut down on corruption.

He said the attorney general's office was also making progress in terms of cracking down on corruption but that the US forces will keep an eye on this.

He said young leaders were meanwhile emerging - leaders who were energetic and were being taken seriously.

Asked whether he was confident about winning the war, Nicholson said: ""I am very focused on my mission here and on delivering for the Afghan people and delivering for my nation and the alliance. I am very encouraged by the new policy by the United States ... yes I do feel confident.""

This interview comes just two days after Nicholson addressed a press conference in Kabul and said the Taliban has become a ""criminal organization that is more interested in profits from drugs, kidnapping and murder for hire.""

He called on the group to lay down their arms and end the war.

""Taliban have a simple choice: Stop fighting against your countrymen. Stop killing innocent civilians. Stop bringing hardship and misery,"" he said.

He also said: ""We will not fail in Afghanistan. Our national security depends on that as well.""

Nicholson made it clear that the US and NATO stand by the Afghan security forces against terrorists and enemies of Afghanistan and said that the Taliban cannot win on the battlefield. ""It's time for them to join the peace process.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOLOnews', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'TOLOnews'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta_Shura', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta Shura'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narcotic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Special forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Air_Force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Air Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Commando'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Political corruption'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Security Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Organized crime'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Illegal drug trade'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'National security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kidnapping'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}]",http://www.tolonews.com/sites/default/files/Nicholson-26-Augus4-2017.jpg,eng-3382459,0.05882352941176472,241450140,1,tolonews.com,news,TOLOnews,TOLOnews Taliban Terrorism Peshawar Pakistan Afghanistan NATO United States Armed Forces Quetta Demographics of Afghanistan Quetta Shura Government of Pakistan Politics of Afghanistan Narcotic Donald Trump Insurgency Special forces Federal government of the United States Ashraf Ghani Pakistan Air Force Commando President of Afghanistan Political corruption Al-Qaeda Afghan National Security Forces Organized crime Illegal drug trade National security Kidnapping Kabul,Afghanistan,AF,,,,,,C8,Asia,AS,Muslim,164.0,166.0,148.0,149.0,166.0,154.0,139.0,159.0,152.0,153.0,153.0,157.0,155.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,26,29,13,2017-08-26

On August 21, President Donald Trump revealed his new war strategy in combating terrorism in Afghanistan. For most part, Trump's new policy in Afghanistan is a continuation of his predecessors 'war policy with some exceptions.

First, the conditions on the ground will guide our war strategy instead of setting time tables:

From a military point of view, this appears to be a sound strategy. Psychologically, this strategy provides comfort to the anguished Afghans who have been pre-occupied with this perception of when is the United States going to abandon them again as it did in 1989, after winning the cold war. At the same time, people are worried about the continuation of war and upheaval that has devastated the country since 1978

Second, we are in Afghanistan to assist the Afghan National Security Forces win the war against the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and ISIS (Daesh):

In the past 16 years, the United States and our allies have been involved in fighting the insurgents in the area. In fact, in 2010-2011, there were nearly one hundred thousand American troops with another forty thousand international forces representing 49 nations, deployed to Afghanistan. If we could not defeat the insurgency with such a large formidable force, how can we win the war against the insurgents and terrorists with only 8,400 American troops currently dispatched in Afghanistan?

Third, Pakistan must stop harboring these terrorists and criminals who are involved in the killing of innocent civilians:

This is an important point made by President Trump regarding the double sided policy of Pakistan towards Afghanistan. While Pakistan played an important role in hosting millions of Afghan refugees during the Soviet intervention in 1980s, it has also been complicit in harboring terror groups and sending them to the Afghan soil in order to create instability and maintain its strategic depth in the country. The Afghans have been bemoaning about the safe haven for terrorists in Pakistan for many years. Osama Bin Ladin, the mastermind of 9/11 attacks, was killed by our forces inside Pakistan in 2011, despite the Government of Pakistan's repeated denials that Bin Ladin was in Pakistan. It is about time for the United States to exert political pressure on Pakistan in order to work towards a stable Afghanistan. After all, the security of both countries is co-dependent on mutual cooperation and respect for the sovereignty of each nation. President Trump could have explicitly stated the consequences of continued Pakistani collusion with terror groups.

Fourth, as part of our strategic partnership, India can play a greater role in providing economic assistance to Afghanistan:

India has been a very reliable partner helping Afghanistan on a number of different projects. Strengthening the United States and Indian partnership on Afghanistan will serve the strategic American interest in the region where China enjoys considerable influence. One challenge facing our foreign policy in South Asia is how to maintain a balanced approach between India and Pakistan, two nuclear powers involved in a conflict with Kashmir.

Fifth, the Military leadership on the ground will have complete autonomy to attack and kill these terrorists:

Coordination of military activities between the Afghan Government, the United States and the allies is extremely important for success of the Afghan mission. Civilian casualties and house to house searches by foreign forces will be culturally offensive and unacceptable to the Afghans. In fact civilian casualties and bombing of Afghan homes adversely affected the former president Hamid Karzai's relationship with the United States.

Sixth, we are not in Afghanistan for nation building. It is up to the leadership of Afghanistan to introduce the needed reforms in order to build their country:

This is a very complex issue and is unrealistic for the United States to detach itself from the issues facing the Afghan leadership and institutions alike. The essential ingredients of Governance such as rule of law, transparency, responsiveness to the needs of the people, consensus building, equity and inclusiveness, effectiveness and efficiency, accountability and participation are still considered to be big obstacles to peace and security for Afghans. Additionally, maintaining security, endemic corruption and cultivation and production of drugs are enormous problems for the fragile Unity Government to tackle on their own. As the Afghans are transitioning towards building their own country, the leadership of the country need international monetary and technical assistance towards self- sufficiency which will take many years to achieve.

The Missing Link: President Trump's Strategy in Afghanistan only dealt with one side of the coin that is killing the terrorists. Working towards peace and stability is the missing link of the other side of the coin in President Trump's policy declaration on Afghanistan. While fighting the terrorists may win us some battles, it is only peace that will win the war for the Afghan people. Working towards peace has three dimensions in Afghanistan:

· Intra Afghan dialogue: All segments of the Afghan society such as academia, members of civil society, political parties, tribal and ethnic leaders, religious figures, women groups and youth groups should have the opportunity to engage in a national dialogue in order to assess the opportunities and challenges towards peace making and peace building. Such a national consensus lends more credibility towards achieving peace in the country. Currently, despite the overwhelming support of the Afghan population towards peace, no consensus has been built among all segments of population on how to proceed.

· Regional Dialogue: The neighboring countries of Pakistan, India, China, Turkey, Iran and Russia with participation of oil rich Gulf Countries can play an important role towards a peaceful Afghanistan. In fact, both the mutual interests of the United States and Russia converge on Afghanistan in fighting terrorism and drugs. Similarly, engaging Iran and Saudi Arabia on the same table towards the Afghan peace process will build more confidence between these two rival nations representing two different sects of Islam.

· The International dimension of support for a comprehensive peace in Afghanistan is essential. The United States can undertake this joint initiative in the United Nations by making peace making and peace building on top of our agenda.

The United States and the international community have spent billions of dollars and have made sacrifices in Afghanistan. The American people are tired of this longest war in Afghanistan. Unless we take some bold steps towards peace, the agony of the Afghan nation will continue and we have no way out of this quagmire in Afghanistan. After all, we should have learned this lesson from the former Soviet ten years of occupation in Afghanistan.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5,

US President Donald Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan contains some bold new ideas that might help, but he got the most important part wrong.

When Trump said: ""We are not nation-building again ... we are killing terrorists,"" he was catering to an American citizenry grown weary of this never-ending war. But help with nation-building is precisely what Afghanistan needs most.

First, here are the good aspects of the new strategy: a US president finally is warning Pakistan that it won't be able to support radical elements with its own security establishment and still get billions of US taxpayer dollars to ""fight"" terrorists. Also, Trump has sent a strong message to the Afghan government that the era of the blank check is over. Too much cash meant to help the people of Afghanistan has ended up in foreign bank accounts of corrupt Afghan officials or unscrupulous foreign contractors.

But here is where Trump misses the point: like presidents before him, he has opted for a military solution to a socio-economic problem. As long as Afghanistan teeters on the brink of becoming a failed state, the men of its disenfranchised younger generation will be easy bait for the Taliban and other insurgencies.

The Trump plan is based on a sound military assessment that any rapid withdrawal would lead to a total collapse of Afghanistan's relatively democratic system. The country would become a breeding ground for international terrorism.

But no amount of artillery and death can miraculously turn Afghanistan into a prosperous nation, free of socio-economic ills and political sclerosis. More guns and killing will only prolong this nightmare.

Trump eschews ""nation building,"" but imagine if $5 billion USD a year were spent on building roads, clinics and major infrastructure instead of weapons and soldiers. We know that the US isn't responsible for fixing Afghanistan's socio-economic problems, but if the collapse of Afghanistan into terroristic chaos presents a clear and present danger to the US, why not pull out the root of the problem, instead of just trimming the leaves?

We need to use our soft power to build Afghanistan from within. The military option not only doesn't work, but exacerbates the problem. Guns and soldiers merely give the insurgency a cause for jihad against the ""invaders"" and solidifies their base. Increased American military operations also inevitably lead to more civilian casualties, which harms the American image.

US troop escalation raises tensions in neighboring countries and prompts US adversaries to further help the insurgency. It could heighten the rivalry between Pakistan and India, tempting Pakistan into further use of the Taliban as their proxy to counter the Indian influence in Afghanistan.

The soft power of nation-building would work because, despite 16 years of violence and setbacks, many Afghans still view the US as an ally and friend, not as the invader they once viewed the Soviet Union during its occupation in 1980s.

The generation of Afghans who were in their teens when the US liberated Afghanistan from the yoke of Taliban are now in their 20's and 30's. They have tasted freedom of expression and the right to peaceably assemble. Women are now members of cabinets and Afghan parliament. None of that would have happened under the Taliban. US values have taken root and grown in Afghanistan, and that's why we don't see mass demonstrations on the streets against the US or Afghan government. The new generation appreciates the fact that there is no going back, and they want to preserve what has been accomplished. These successes are a result of American soft power.

There is no correlation between the number of NATO troops and the level of peace in rural areas. In places like Helmand, where the bulk of NATO forces is concentrated, violence levels are much higher than in areas where there are no foreign troops. Why? Because in places without troops, the villagers take matters into their own hands and defend themselves against Taliban.

Afghan media reports that in the Mirzaka district of Paktia province, village elders and tribal leaders impose hefty monetary fines on any who support or give sanctuary to insurgents. Some who violate this decree have been punished by the burning of their homes.

So, Trump, the facts strongly show that it's time for a shift from military options to some nation-building. Yes, politically, it will be a hard sell in the US. Why would taxpayers support job creation in Afghanistan when their government is struggling to do the same at home?

But if they think of this as simply a shift in the allocation of funds that are already being spent, it makes sense. Americans did the same thing after World War II, nation-building in Japan and Germany, and it led to generations of peace that remains to this day.

Afghans must accept that this would not be a free lunch. If they fail to fulfill their responsibility to fight corruption and restore accountability, all the good will and money the US can offer would fail. Afghans should prepare for more sacrifices and tighten their financial belts to help the US help them.

Dropping the Mother of All Bombs may kill more insurgents, but it will do nothing to address the cause of the problem.","[{'uri': 'wahab_raofi@tolonews.com', 'name': 'Wahab Raofi', 'type': 'author',
