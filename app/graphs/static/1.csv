India lost Ravindra Jadeja in the morning but Kohli and KS Bharat, who was batting on 25, denied Australia another wicket in the slow-moving session on day four at the Narendra Modi Stadium.

After Cameron Green bowled the first over of the day, Australia opted for spin from both ends and Todd Murphy managed to break the 64-run partnership between Kohli and Jadeja.

Jadeja, who made 28, chipped the ball to Usman Khawaja at mid-on in the final of his several attempts to clear the fielders inside the ring.

Kohli dug his heel in and was happy to nudge the ball around, while Bharat hit Nathan Lyon for a six before putting his head down and accumulating runs without taking too many risks.

Kohli's last test hundred came against Bangladesh in November 2019, in what was the first day-night test in India.

For India, who lead the series 2-1, Shreyas Iyer could not come out to bat because of back pain and went for scans.","[{'uri': 'reuters@reuters.com', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting order (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Reuters'}}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/kfN1CuqNQ_8DaSua_pAK3sbe1As=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CCELCQSUE5ND7EEPENWPVGC6MY.jpg,eng-8469535,-0.02745098039215688,416299620,1,reuters.com,news,Reuters,Virat Kohli Ravindra Jadeja Batting (cricket) India Batting order (cricket) Innings Australia national cricket team Ahmedabad Australia Narendra Modi Stadium Spin bowling Wicket Bowling (cricket) Nathan Lyon Usman Khawaja Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Fielding (cricket) Cricket bat Shreyas Iyer Reuters,United-Kingdom,UK,,,,,C4,C2,Europe,EU,Christian,12.0,21.0,17.0,15.0,15.0,10.0,10.0,12.0,15.0,9.0,34.0,14.0,22.0,35.0,89.0,66.0,35.0,51.0,69.0,,,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,47,6,2023-03-12

Kohli finally brought up three figures against after lunch on day four of the fourth Test against Australia in Ahmedabad.

It was far from one of the 34-year-old's finest knocks, but it will be one of his most satisfying after his high standards have slipped in recent years.

Kohli, arguably India's greatest batter after Sachin Tendulkar, scored his previous Test ton in November 2019 when he hit 136 against Bangladesh.

On Saturday, the right-hander ended a 15-innings run without making a Test fifty.

It was Kohli's eighth Test century against Australia - his most against any team - and 14th in India.

He scored just 111 runs during the first three Tests as all batters struggled on pitches heavily favouring spin bowling.

India strung together six 50-plus partnerships to reach 472-5 at the tea break, with Kohli registering his first test hundred since November 2019.

All-rounder Axar Patel was batting on 38 at the other end.

India lost Ravindra Jadeja (28) after resuming on 289-3 but Kohli and KS Bharat denied Australia another success in that slow-moving session.

After Cameron Green bowled the first over of the day, Australia opted for spin from both ends and Todd Murphy broke Kohli's 64-run partnership with Jadeja, who chipped the ball to Usman Khawaja at mid-on.

Kohli was happy to nudge the ball around, while Bharat hit Nathan Lyon for a six before putting his head down and accumulating runs without taking too many risks.

Promoted in the batting order as Shreyas Iyer went for scans after complaining of back pain, Bharat accelerated after the lunch break, hitting Green for back-to-back sixes and following it with a four in a 21-run over.

Bharat fell to Lyon after making 44, but Kohli could not be denied his milestone.

The right-hander brought up his 75th international century with a single off Lyon and kissed the locket of his necklace and looked skywards in a muted celebration.

The 34-year-old superstar fell short of the double century when he was caught by Marnus Labuschagne off Todd Murphy.

He received a rapturous reception having put India in a healthy position.

India, who lead the series 2-1, effectively put themselves in an unbeatable position heading into the final day of the contest.

Having started the day on 59, Kohli continued to be the inspiration and provided more evidence that he has recaptured his form in a patient innings.

After a barren spell in 2021 and 2022 with the bat, which led to him losing the captaincy and also open up about his mental health struggles, Kohli has knocked one-day and T20 centuries in recent months.

Now his long wait for a 28th Test hundred has ended - and his relief was clear to see.

An emotional Kohli kissed the locket on his gold chain, smiling and looking up to the sky, as the crowd jubilantly celebrated his achievement.

Axar Patel, who hit four sixes and five fours in his 79, worked with Kohli to put on a sixth-wicket partnership of 162 and once he departed, Australia quickly took the wickets of Ravichandran Ashwin and Umesh Yadav.

Kohli played less cautiously when he realised he was running out of partners and became the last Indian wicket to fall when he was caught by Labuschagne at long-on.

Trailing by 91-0 runs, Australia finished the day on 3-0.

SCORE: Australia 480 and 0-3, India 571

SUMMARY: India were determined to bat as long as they could on a pitch showing no signs of cracking up. After starting the day at 3-289, Virat Kohli went about pushing India past Australia's first-innings total of 480 and to a lead of 91. Kohli was the last batter out for 186, leaving Australia to survive six overs before stumps.

MAN OF THE MOMENT: Kohli ended a frustrating drought of more than three years to post his 28th Test century and eighth against Australia. It was nowhere near Kohli's best innings, but he battled his way back into form on a flat pitch.

KEY MOMENT: The colossal Narendra Modi Stadium might have only been at about one-sixth capacity but the crowd made it sound like it was full when Kohli reached his long-awaited century.

STAT OF THE DAY: India became just the third team in Test history to have their first six partnerships of an innings pass 50; Australia in the tied Test in Brisbane against the West Indies in 1960 and Pakistan against Bangladesh in 2015 are the others.

Kohli's 186 and Shubman Gill's 128 helped India establish a 91-run lead against the visitors, who were bowled out for 480 in their first innings.

Virat Kohli hit his first Test century in over three years with a towering 186 on Sunday to give India a sniff of what would be a stunning victory in the fourth Test against Australia.

The hosts finished their first innings on 571 to overhaul Australia's 480 and get a first-innings lead of 91 on another run-filled day four at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.

Kohli was the last man out after he fell to Todd Murphy in the final session of play as India lost their ninth wicket and Shreyas Iyer did not bat due to back pain.

His wife, Bollywood actor Anushka Sharma, took to social media after the end of day's play to say the former captain was ""playing through sickness"" during his epic knock.

Australia reached three for no loss at stumps with Travis Head getting the runs while alongside nightwatchman Matthew Kuhnemann.

The left-handed Kuhnemann made a surprise entry to the crease after opener Usman Khawaja, who hit 180 in Australia's innings, did not come out to bat after getting hurt on the field.

Axar Patel, who shared a 162-run sixth-wicket partnership with Kohli, admitted that another Australia collapse like in the earlier Tests was unlikely, but that India would still try.

""It will not be like we will run through them like in the previous three games. We will have to work hard, keep patience and bowl on good areas,"" Axar said.

Kohli ruled the day with his 28th Test ton after he got a single off spinner Nathan Lyon in the second session to bring the house down as fans went wild with celebration.

Kohli, who now has 75 international tons across three international formats, kissed his locket before looking up to the sky.

- Smash and grind -

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Saturday since January 2022, the landmark came after a patient innings of 241 balls.

""He's a class player and he didn't give us a chance really,"" Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey said of the star batsman.

""We knew it was going to be tough bowling to Virat. We were able to contain him as much as we could and try to take wickets around him.""

Kohli then hit a flurry of fours after reaching his hundred and along with an attacking Axar, who made 79.

Khawaja attempted to catch an Axar six at the boundary but could not stay inside the rope, hurting his foot in the process and limping off the field.

It was termed as ""lower leg soreness"" by a team spokesperson and it was unclear if the batsman would play on the fifth day.

Kohli got past 150 after tea and Axar reached his third half-century of the series to wear down the opposition bowlers on a pitch vastly different from the rank turners in the previous three matches.

Spinners Lyon and Murphy bowled 110.5 overs between to get three wickets each on another day of hard grind for the bowlers.

Axar went into fifth gear after his fifty as he slogged and smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over before being bowled off an inside edge by Mitchell Starc.

Kohli lost his overnight partner Ravindra Jadeja for 28 in the morning session and Srikar Bharat fell in the afternoon after the wicketkeeper-batsman hit 44 in an 84-run partnership with the former captain.

Opener Shubman Gill led India's strong reply on Saturday with his 128.

Sunday offered the best environment to start again

Between March 2011 and and March 2012, the people waited for Sachin Tendulkar. With 99 international centuries, he was on the verge of something nobody else had ever considered achieving. Cricket stats are usually for a niche set of people, but this one grew as time went on. It sprouted tendrils that curled past the nuffies before lacing their way through broader society. For 33 international innings, more and more people watched each time as Tendulkar walked out to bat and returned without a ton. It almost drove them mad.

That wait was a year and four days. Virat Kohli's version dwarfs it. As the man who succeeded Tendulkar as the centre of India's batting solar system, Kohli churned out hundreds like a machine. His first three years when he was only playing 50-over cricket took some time, but once his Test career started the longest gap he had to abide was eight months. Across the formats he went back to back routinely, three in a row twice, four in five innings at one stage. Before the interregnum, he scored 70 centuries in just over 10 years.

Then it stopped. Not for any apparent reason. He kept making starts, kept making scores, some of them big, some unbeaten. He just couldn't get a hundred - the man whose principal skill to this point had been converting those. A year became two, then approached three. The streak spanned 83 innings. In 26 of them, he scored half-centuries. He just couldn't get over the line.

Of course, it shouldn't matter. The hundred is an arbitrary number. But batters know that is the measure on which they are judged on most, so of course it matters. Of course it gets in their heads, affects their thinking, which affects their play. The drought across formats finally ended in September 2022, in low-key fashion with a T20 hundred against Afghanistan during an Asia Cup that was treated as a World Cup warm-up. The gap between Test hundreds, though, went on, past three years, out to 42 innings in 24 Tests.

Finally, in Ahmedabad on Sunday in the fourth and final Test against Australia, it ended. Kohli went big on day four, resuming on 59, finishing on 186, misfiring a shot at 200 when running out of partners. It was an innings of discipline more than stroke play, batting almost all day in enervating heat. It was also curiously lacking in ambition on a pitch where 19 wickets have fallen in four days.

There are explanations. After years of falling short, anxiety would have been an obstacle even had he been facing a tennis ball. There was pressure in needing to seize one chance on a batting pitch after playing the rest of the series on turners. To Kohli's advantage was that India don't need to win this last Test given they already lead the series. A draw does risk missing the World Test Championship final, but Sri Lanka winning 2-0 in New Zealand would have to be counted among the unlikelier prospects in cricket.

The match situation was a factor: 309 for four when Ravindra Jadeja got out in the morning, still 171 runs behind Australia's first innings, with the wicketkeeper and lower order for company after middle-order bat Shreyas Iyer withdrew with injury. India did need Kohli to bat long enough to close the door on any chance of losing.

What made less sense was going stonewall, when taking runs off Australia would have been the faster way to reduce risk. Even before Jadeja was out, Kohli started the day scoring 12 runs in 22 overs. The 41 runs to reach his hundred took 39 overs. There were few close catchers, gaps to boundary riders, and a surface offering negligible turn, but blocking spin straight back down the pitch was the mode of the day.

Even being bowled out 100 behind would have been a safe position for India, unlikely to have time to suffer the same fate twice if Australia batted long enough to set a target, while it would have given India a chance to exert pressure on Australia with the ball. If you want a result on surfaces like this you need to push the game along.

Instead Kohli was able to concentrate on personal achievements in what was the best situation to do so. His focus didn't hurt his team. It made the home crowd happy. It now gives India the benefit of a Kohli with that monkey off his back. When the milestone came, he recognised the low-octane nature of the show, offering only a measured wave to the crowd and a kiss of his wedding ring. Then back to work.

More than 42 overs had passed before Kohli hit his first boundary of the day. It started his most fluent period, stroking ten fours in 25 overs, including a couple of signature gorgeousness. Then as Axar Patel started bombing sixes, Kohli reverted to singles. After Axar was out, singles. India had the lead, the scoreboard was irrelevant, and the only reason Kohli was still out there was to chase a double century. He had faced 340 balls for 177 runs, having so many opportunities to get closer. The dwindling batting resources at the other end were apparently something he had not seen coming.

By the time Kohli was trying to boss the strike, with nine fielders on the fence and the tip of the tail for company, it was like he couldn't remember how. His signature bunt for two, feature of so many T20 chases, instead ran out Umesh Yadav. His first attempted big hit was dropped. His second was held in the deep. He had tried to shift gears and missed the clutch. It ended an innings of endurance, of technical correctness, of flashes of mica in the stone. Still, let's hope that his next effort can have more of the former shine.","[{'uri': 'geoff_lemon@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Geoff Lemon', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri':

Kohli scored his first Test hundred since November 2019 and 28th overall in the high-scoring drawn fourth Test in Ahmedabad.

Australia needed to win the final Test to secure an unlikely 2-2 series draw and posted 480 after first-innings centuries from Usman Khawaja and Cameron Green.

But Kohli's 186 and Shubman Gill's first ton at home frustrated Australia and gave India a lead of 91 as they racked up 571.

The tourists had reached 175-2 - a lead of 84 - when the teams shook hands on day five.

Kohli had gone over three years without a Test century but made the most of favourable batting conditions to make 186 from 364 balls in Ahmedabad.

The 34-year-old already sits second on the list of most international hundreds with 75 and Singh believes he can surpass Tendulkar, who made 100 during his astonishing 664-match international career.

'It's certainly possible. I think he can go past Tendulkar,' the former India spinner told SportsTak.

'Two things favour Virat here: his age and his fitness. He's 34 but he's as fit as a 24-year-old cricketer. He's way ahead in that aspect.

'He has already scored 75 centuries, he can score at least 50 more. He knows his game and he plays all formats.

'You might think I'm going overboard, but it is certainly possible. If anyone can do it, it's Virat Kohli. The rest all are far behind him.

'He knew he had to work on his fitness because his batting abilities are god-gifted. I don't think he will stop from here.

'There are no technical faults, and even if they are, he works on them and rectifies them. Since his return, he has already scored five centuries. This is pretty much a comeback for him.'

The draw in Ahmedabad saw India clinch a 16th consecutive series win at home and secure the Border-Gavaskar trophy for the fourth successive time.

India also secured their place in June's World Test Championship final against Australia after Sri Lanka suffered a dramatic final-ball defeat to New Zealand.

Captain Rohit Sharma said: 'It was a fantastic series. Right from the word go, it was exciting.

'We understand the importance of this series and the opposition. A lot of hard work has gone into this so we're really happy.

'At different times we have come up with answers. I'm really proud of the Delhi Test in particular. We were behind in the game.

'Different players put their hands up. A lot of the guys took the responsibility and bailed us out. Test cricket is always hard-fought, it's never easy, so I'm quite satisfised.'

World Test Championship final opponents India and Australia now play a three-match ODI series, starting on Friday.

King Kohli, as he is affectionately known in his cricket-mad country, hit an imperious 186 against Australia in the fourth and final match and for once silenced the millions who wanted him benched. It was fitting Kohli ended the drought in the world's largest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad which sits 132,000 and as one expected there were raucous celebrations. The match itself ended in a tame draw with India retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2-1.

One of this generation's greatest batsmen Kohli admitted that his mental health issues was one of the reasons he struggled last year. Losing the Indian captaincy, one of the most high-pressure jobs in world sport, also played its part.

In a post-match interview, Kohli admitted he was relieved with his ton. ""To be honest, the expectations I have from myself as a player is more important to me. I also need to justify why I am there on the field.''",[],"[{'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Drought'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}]",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/torontosun/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CRICKET-TEST-IND-AUS_-1-e1678810832409.jpg?quality=100&strip=all,eng-8469535,0.2313725490196079,416508540,1,lfpress.com,news,London Free Press,Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019 Border–Gavaskar Trophy Drought Cricket Ahmedabad India Batting (cricket) Captain (cricket),United-Kingdom,UK,,,,,C4,C2,Europe,EU,Christian,12.0,21.0,17.0,15.0,15.0,10.0,10.0,12.0,15.0,9.0,34.0,14.0,22.0,35.0,89.0,66.0,35.0,51.0,69.0,,,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,49,16,2023-03-14
