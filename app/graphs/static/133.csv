The hosts, who lead the series 2-1, strung together six 50-plus partnerships at the top to effectively put themselves in an unbeatable position heading into the final day of the contest.

Having conceded a handy first-innings lead, Australia finished day four on three for no loss.

The touring side sent nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann to open with Travis Head after in-form opener Usman Khawaja hurt his knee while fielding.

Kuhnemann, who survived 18 balls, was nearly caught on two occasions but Australia somehow saw off the final six overs without any damage.

Earlier, India lost Ravindra Jadeja (28) after resuming on 289-3 but Kohli and KS Bharat denied Australia another success in that slow-moving session.

Todd Murphy (3-113) broke Kohli's 64-run partnership with Jadeja, who chipped the ball to Khawaja at mid-on.

Kohli was happy to nudge the ball around, while Bharat hit Nathan Lyon for a six before putting his head down and accumulating runs without taking too many risks.

Promoted in the batting order as Shreyas Iyer did not bat because of back pain, Bharat accelerated after the lunch break, hitting Green for back-to-back sixes and following it with a four in a 21-run over.

Bharat fell to Lyon after making 44, but Kohli could not be denied his first test hundred since November 2019.

The right-hander took a single off Lyon to bring up his 75th international century. Kohli kissed the locket of his necklace and looked skywards in a muted celebration.

Patel, who smashed four sixes and five fours in his belligerent 79, continued his red-hot form with the bat, registering his third half-century of the series.

The left-hander smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over and was looking good for a maiden test hundred before he dragged a Mitchell Starc delivery on to his stumps.

Patel's 162-run stand for the sixth wicket with Kohli was the highest in the Indian innings.

With Ravichandran Ashwin and Umesh Yadav falling in quick succession and Iyer not available to bat, Kohli realised he was running out of partners and tried to accelerate.

He became the last Indian wicket to fall, holing out to Marnus Labuschagne at long-on to depart after a 364-ball knock, which included 15 fours.

Lyon alone bowled 65 of Australia's 178.5 overs on a flat track where bowlers found little assistance.

India are chasing a victory in Ahmedabad to confirm their place in the final of the World Test Championship against Australia in June.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwatchman_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nightwatchman (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting order (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}]","https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--R11cCjWN--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2023-03-12t063412z_2_lynxmpej2b023_rtroptp_3_cricket-test-ind-aus.jpg?itok=5BPVzYr-",eng-8469535,0.02745098039215677,416319720,1,channelnewsasia.com,news,CNA,Virat Kohli Australia Usman Khawaja India Nightwatchman (cricket) Ravindra Jadeja Travis Head Boundary (cricket) Ahmedabad Nathan Lyon Batting order (cricket) Fielding (cricket) Over (cricket) Cricket bat Shreyas Iyer Umesh Yadav Marnus Labuschagne Ravichandran Ashwin Mitchell Starc ICC World Test Championship Stump (cricket) Innings Wicket Bowling (cricket),United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,22,12,2023-03-12

After all, it was the modern batting great's first test hundred since November 2019, when he used to be captain of the side as well.

Since that 136 in Kolkata against Bangladesh in what was the first ever day-night test in India, Kohli had gone 41 innings without a test hundred, with many wondering if the 34-year-old was past his prime.

Half a dozen test half-centuries in that lean period and centuries in other formats did little to address the concerns of his fans who have only high expectations from someone who now has 75 international hundreds, second only to compatriot Sachin Tendulkar's 100.

Kohli looked in good form in the second test against Australia in Delhi but ended his slump in Ahmedabad which presented the best batting conditions in the four-test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Kohli took 241 balls to bring up his 28th test hundred, making it among his slowest.

His painstaking 186 would not count among his best knocks either but it could not have come at a better time for him and he had to work hard to emerge from the slump in form.

Like so often in the past, Kohli did not race to his century but rather constructed it even if it meant running hard between wickets under a harsh Ahmedabad sun with temperatures hovering around 37 degrees Celsius.

Such was his discipline that Kohli went 161 balls without hitting a boundary, preferring to accumulate runs in a risk-free way.

""It was so hot out there and the way he ran between the wickets and built the partnership, it was really great,"" Axar Patel, Kohli's partner in a 162-run stand for the sixth wicket, told reporters.

Patel said Kohli also egged him on to go for a maiden test hundred.

""Once I got set, I was connecting everything that came into my radar. He was also giving me inputs - like once I got my fifty, I should bat long since there was still 22 overs left in the day.""

The only blemish in Kohli's 364-ball knock was towards the end when Peter Handscomb dropped him off Nathan Lyon when the batsman was on 185.

By then, Kohli was beginning to run out of partners with number five batsman Shreyas Iyer not available to bat because of back pain.

A tired-looking Kohli finally departed holing out to Marnus Labuschagne after eight-and-a-half hours of hard toil to salvage his reputation.

Kohli's return to form was welcomed by several former players.

""Welcome back Virat Kohli. This is a test century well received in many quarters,"" tweeted former West Indies bowler Ian Bishop.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Handscomb', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Peter Handscomb'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'West Indies cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Run out'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}]","https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--1JjdQRIt--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2023-03-12t133941z_1_lynxmpej2b04l_rtroptp_3_cricket-test-ind-aus.jpg?itok=svuVsp1f",eng-8469535,0.2392156862745098,416325180,1,channelnewsasia.com,news,CNA,Virat Kohli Ahmedabad Australia national cricket team Batting (cricket) Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Century (cricket) Innings Wicket Captain (cricket) Kolkata India Sachin Tendulkar Delhi Marnus Labuschagne Nathan Lyon Peter Handscomb Axar Patel West Indies cricket team Run out Over (cricket) Cricket bat Shreyas Iyer Bowling (cricket),United-States,USA,,,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,19.0,average,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,average,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,53,13,2023-03-12
