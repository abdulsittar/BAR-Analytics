Elusive question of who calls the shots in global trade,"The world is changing today at a pace not witnessed before. Technology has changed day-to-day lives and, increasingly, the role technology plays in our lives is being buttressed through strategic investments in artificial intelligence (AI).

Open AI, an American artificial intelligence research laboratory, recently launched ChatGPT which has caused an uproar in all spectrums of society. Italy has become the first country to ban the use of ChatGPT over privacy concerns, an action that might soon be adopted by other European Union (EU) member states.

Second, the effects of Covid-19 and the responses from the private sector, multinational corporations, and governments, which have largely been criticized by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) for not being human-centered, are still changing every action being taken by various actors in the health sector, academy, world of work, and commerce.

This has seen huge investments in the use of platforms and algorithms as mechanisms of coordination in otherwise traditional work settings; what has since been described as the platformisation of work.

Third, the Russian-Ukraine war is morphing into a Frankenstein that seeks to redefine global politics post-Cold War era.

The People's Republic of China seems to be taking advantage of the war to advance its global political agenda of cooperation as opposed to dominance that has been at play since the collapse of the Berlin Wall. On the other hand, the European Union (EU) continues to extend its influence globally, as argued in the Brussels Effect, through a unilateral approach to the adoption of EU regulations and policies for 'sustainable and inclusive economic development'.

Key players

Consequently, international trade is changing. The rules of the game and the role(s) played by various players in the international system, political and financial, are changing. This explains the rising concerns about the use of the dollar in international trade just as there are questions on the role being played by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), World Bank (WB), and International Monetary Fund (IMF).

At the center of all this is polarity which, according to Kenneth Waltz, has remained a constant drama in the international system evidenced by the rise and fall of great powers. To Waltz, in his theory of international politics, polarity is the single most variable that can explain the level of instability, or war, in the world. Accordingly, and as Deniz Aktunc has explained, England, France, Habsburg Empire, and Ottoman Empire were almost equally great powers from 1495 to 1521 before a rivalry occurred between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans, in which Ottoman Empire had a superior position, that transformed the world into a multipolar system that will endure until 1945.

Arguably, World War I & II were as a result of the dysfunctionalities of the multipolar which, thereafter, ushered in the cold war which was a Bipolar system and war between the US and the USSR. The US has, since the end of the cold war, been recognized as the superpower, ruling over international institutions as tools to be used in the exercise of their power.

In its relations with the world, the US has, mostly, relied on dominance and identity as opposed to reciprocity. For instance, in its relations with the developing world, dating back from the reliance of the former to the latter, the invisible, and sometimes visible, Washington dominating hand has been witnessed in the policies and politics of many developing countries. This has, however, not been the case with China which has strongly relied on reciprocity with other developing countries where Beijing's relations with other developing countries have seen capsulated to appear like a mutually beneficial relationship.

Reciprocal relationship

On the other hand, the US's relations with other great powers and international organisations have mostly been reciprocal.

The EU, for example, China and Russia have enjoyed a mutual relationship with the US based on trade while international organisations have equally remained to have a reciprocal relationship with the US.

However, a 2016 article published by the World Economic Forum, argues that by 2030 the world's political landscape will look considerably different with no single hegemonic force but instead a handful of countries - inter alia, the US, Russia, China, Germany, India, and Japan - still exhibiting tendencies of dominance.

With all these changes in the international system, there is a possibility that the world might be experiencing Cold War II. And just like during the Cold War I, no one wants to, officially, admit there is a war and, secondly, enlist the parties involved. The Russia-Ukraine war might have acted as a catalyst to this war or, still, was part of the wider scheme.

There is a hypothesis that in politics nothing happens by accidence and if it does, you can bet it was planned that way.

While Cold War I was about establishing a unipolar world which resulted in the United States being a superpower, Cold War II might be about reestablishing bipolarity in the international political systems and determining who controls the international finance system and, consequently, international trade.

Bipolarity in politics

If, indeed, there is a fight for reestablishing bipolarity, then the talks in Moscow between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin give a panoramic view of what awaits. That Beijing seeks to play a more constructive role in fostering world peace is an interesting development and a matter that has not been received kindly in Washington and Brussels. According to a White House Spokesman, if there were to be a cease-fire overseen by China, this would ""effectively ratify the Russian conquest and in effect recognize Russia's gains and its attempt to conquer its neighbor's territory by force, allowing Russian troops to continue to occupy sovereign Ukrainian territory.""

Similarly, China has been, according to some analysts, become the ambassador of free trade while the US has continued to misuse general, security, and economic exemptions to international trade as provided for by the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO. This has seen the US block the appointment of new judges to the WTO's Appellate Body, notwithstanding the fact that this body is seminal to the success of WTO.

Future of international trade

But one of the most important outcome of the talks in Moscow was what the Financial time has described as a multipolar currency world.

The pledge by Putin to adopt the use of Chinese Currency, the yuan, also known as the renminbi, for ""payments between Russia and countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America"", in a bid to displace the dollar, compounded by the strategic move by China to urge other developing countries to consider trading using the yuan might change international trade as we know it.

The EU, on the other hand, is changing international trade by raising the conversation on environment and labour standards.

Brussels, by coming up with up-to-date regulations that promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth, is influencing other developing countries to change their policies and regulations to be on par with EU regulations if they would wish to access the large European markets.

Working closely with the EU, the ILO has developed a handbook on the assessment of labour provision in trade and investments to help developing economies, as well as EU member states, recognize and implement labour provisions in future trade deals. This will most likely see ILO start playing a critical role in international trade in the future as opposed to the wait-and-see approach that they have played in the past.

World problems

And with such issues dominating international trade, China might find it hard to play by the rules.

The Chinese cooperative framework that is based on reciprocity might not result in a better world considering they are low in appreciating the fact that some of the cornerstones of democracy hold the key to solving various world problems like climate change and human and labour rights violations.

On the flip side, the US President has committed to promoting democracy across the world through international trade by calling for labour and environmentalist to be included at the table in all future US trade deals. For instance, in the ongoing US-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations, the US has included environmental and climate action and protecting worker's rights and protection among the thirteen areas of focus for this STIP.

With a dominant China on the world stage, however, the conversation on trade and investment might never encompass issues of labour and environment which are turning out to be key issues of contention in future trade deals.

What about Africa?

On the other hand, African countries might continue playing proxy to international affairs if they continue working in silos. Unity seems to be the only currency for the African states.

Kenya, being a leader in the African market and with a progressive foreign policy, is well positioned to grow in influence if the East Africa Community (EAC) works.

Recently, the EAC Secretary General noted that they are considering adding Ethiopia to the EAC, after adding Somalia. While this is a strategic move to enlarge the EAC market, it remains a double edge sword if the theory advanced by Joseph Nye on peace in parts is not given serious consideration.

Second, the sovereignty of the various EAC governments will need to be subject to serious debate if EAC is to achieve political integration. Without political integration, EAC might remain a wild goose chase.

What next?

Be that as it may, the results of the ensuing war, Cold War II, will change the relations between and among states from dominance to more cooperation and reciprocity. If the US takes a more cooperative and reciprocal view of all its international affairs, then chances are that they might continue using this soft power to influence countries on the world stage. The EU, considering it has already undertaken the cooperative approach to international trade might continue influencing the regulation and policies of other countries and raising the bar for international standards.

As for China, there is a chance that it might, this time, redefine international politics, if the resolve by Xi is anything to go by. However, for China to play a more meaningful role in international politics they have to open up their society and embrace democracy. And if they do that, they will discover that their vision of dominating global trade and politics is misplaced with everyone looking up to them for direction.","{'uri': 'standardmedia.co.ke', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Standard Digital News - Kenya', 'description': ""Kenya's Bold Newspaper.

Russian exports of information technology (IT) services to African countries amounted to $8.1 million in January-September 2022, Deputy Minister for Digital Development Dmitry Oguryayev has revealed.

""Africa remains our key partner,"" he stated at the Russia-Africa IT forum on Thursday, noting that imports stood at $2.7 million during that period.

According to Oguryayev, the ministry sees great potential in terms of Russia-Africa trade turnover, thanks to growing cooperation.

""I am confident that digital transformation is important to Africa,"" the deputy minister stressed.

Russia is ready to share technologies for implementing artificial intelligence (AI) with African countries, in terms of implementing both experimental legal regimes and best-business cases, according to another forum speaker, Andrey Filippov.

The Deputy Director for International Cooperation at the 'Digital Economy' organization, which acts as a platform between Russian businesses, technology companies and state bodies, told the event's participants: ""We would happily share the emerging technologies, the results that they produce when implemented, and everything related to this.""

The International IT Forum 'Russia-Africa: digital technologies as a driver of state development and international cooperation' was held in Moscow this week ahead of the Russia-Africa 2023 Summit, which is to take place in St. Petersburg in July. Participants in the forum discussed digitalization of public administration, economy, education and healthcare, among other issues.","{'uri': 'kenyastar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Kenya

Globally the signs of an economic winter are evident in figures from International Monetary Fund, which projects a 2.9% growth this year.

The outlook is more sobering for advanced economies that spur much of the world's project activity. Yet even as many companies buckle up to respond to this downturn, there's still a serious talent shortage.

According to Project Management Institute's most recent Talent Gap report, 2.3 million people will be needed each year to fill all project management-oriented (PMO) positions expected to open by 2030. To remain competitive, companies will need to hire problem solvers and relationship builders who can help drive change and deliver strategic value. During this decade, sub-Saharan Africa will witness a 40% growth in PMO employment

opportunities

The continent's average growth over the past two decades has been a steady 4.5% and 5%. Before the pandemic, six of the world's ten fastest-growing economies were in Africa. When the recession induced by Covid-19 hit the developed economies, shrinking them by 5.5%, Africa remained more resilient, shrinking by just 2%.

""Despite these economic conundrums, PMI's Job Trends Report 2023 notes that the construction, energy, and information technology sectors are well placed to continue playing a key role in the sub-Sharan economy as job creators,"" says George Asamani, MD, PMI for sub-Saharan Africa.

""These sectors, alongside agriculture and manufacturing, have been a cornerstone of the regional economy. Skills shortages as the economy recovers will create significant opportunities for project talent as companies and countries fast-track projects. Also, foreign direct investment to African countries hit a record $83 billion in 2021, according to UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2022.""

Reuters estimates that $100 billion in energy projects are currently under consideration, including a $30 billion liquefied natural gas export terminal in Tanzania backed by Norway's Equinor and energy giant Shell. While long-standing infrastructure and security challenges may stymie some planned initiatives, an assessment by the International Energy Agency found that gas exports from the continent could replace as much as one-fifth of Russia's usual exports by 2030.

Realising the full potential of foreign investments requires that mega infrastructure and energy projects are delivered on schedule, within the scope, and, most importantly, within budget. Demand for industry-ready project professionals essential to this task remains robust, bucking sluggishness in job additions in the broader economy. Knowing where these opportunities will likely bubble up will empower project professionals to find career opportunities.

Project leaders, especially those with power skills that can help organisations navigate turbulent times, will see consistent demand. Across nearly all sectors, communication is the most critical power skill to possess, according to professionals surveyed in the PMI Pulse of the Profession® 2023 report.

Overall, 68% of respondents said it was the most critical power skill -- followed by problem-solving (65%), collaborative leadership (62%), and strategic thinking (58%). Mastering such behaviours and core technical skills will make project professionals more valuable and probably less vulnerable in cases where the job market declines.

""The job market across sub-Saharan Africa has been experiencing a major boom, with project management skills in heavy demand,"" says Fatuma Haghe Adan, senior project manager at AI platform Sama in Nairobi, Kenya.

The demand for a project management skillset is evident in the experience of Kenya-based Wanja Murekio, PMP, who learned from a recruitment firm that ""project professionals have become one of the more expensive hires because demand is so high.""

No wonder there's a pervasive sense among project talent ""that things will get better in 2023,"" adds Murekio, senior program manager, Safaricom, Nairobi.

Google, for instance, opened a product development center in Nairobi in late 2022, just three years after building a major R&D complex in Ghana. Microsoft recently launched its R&D facility in Nairobi, and Visa opened its first innovation center last year, aiming to create commerce and payment solutions across the continent.

""There are non-traditional ways of acquiring skills demanded by the industry. The globally recognised credential, Certified Associate of Project Management (CAPM), is one such. A high school diploma is a minimum requirement to take the exam. Add five years of experience leading projects, and you can aspire for a Project Management Professional certification, a gold standard in the industry. It is worth noting that project management skills are transferable across industries,"" adds Asamani.

This view is supported by Adan, who says, ""A project management certification gives one a competitive edge in the job market. Experience with AI or software development can likewise provide a boost, even for those positions not strictly in the IT sector.""

""Across the region, many governments were still rebuilding their balance sheets when events in Ukraine moved the goalposts. There is a continent-wide acceptance that infrastructure projects can reset the status quo. With $600 billion pledged by the G7 countries to fund projects in developing economies and the government's own efforts to build back better, we could see more jobs being created that will need project management skills,"" says Asamani in conclusion.","{'uri': 'capitalfm.co.ke', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Capital FM Kenya', 'description': 'Capital Fm provides the latest Kenyan news &

There is a shortage of project managers in Africa, even as the continent expects to ride on infrastructure growth to spur economic growth.

The latest talent gap report by Project Management Institute shows that at least 2.3 million people will be needed each year to fill all project management-oriented (PMO) positions expected to open by 2030.

To remain competitive, companies will need to hire problem solvers and relationship builders who can help drive change and deliver strategic value.

During this decade, sub-Saharan Africa will witness a 40 per cent growth in PMO employment opportunities.

Yet even as many companies buckle up to respond to this downturn, there's still a serious talent shortage.

The continent's average growth over the past two decades has been a steady 4.5 and five per cent. Before the pandemic, six of the world's ten fastest-growing economies were in Africa.

When the recession induced by Covid-19 hit the developed economies, shrinking them by 5.5 per cent, Africa remained more resilient, shrinking by just two per cent.

Despite these economic conundrums, PMI's Job Trends Report 2023 notes that the construction, energy, and information technology sectors are well placed to continue playing a key role in the sub-Saharan economy as job creators.

""These sectors, alongside agriculture and manufacturing, have been a cornerstone of the regional economy. Skills shortages as the economy recovers will create significant opportunities for project talent as companies and countries fast-track projects,'' says George Asamani, MD, PMI for sub-Saharan Africa.

Reuters estimates that $100 billion in energy projects are currently under consideration, including a $30 billion liquefied natural gas export terminal in Tanzania backed by Norway's Equinor and energy giant Shell.

While long-standing infrastructure and security challenges may stymie some planned initiatives, an assessment by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that gas exports from the continent could replace as much as one-fifth of Russia's usual exports by 2030

According to the report, realising the full potential of foreign investments requires that mega infrastructure and energy projects are delivered on schedule, within the scope, and, most importantly, within budget.

""Demand for industry-ready project professionals essential to this task remains robust, bucking sluggishness in job additions in the broader economy.'' the report reads.

Knowing where these opportunities will likely bubble up will empower project professionals to find career opportunities.

Project leaders, especially those with power skills that can help organisations navigate turbulent times, will see consistent demand.

Across nearly all sectors, communication is the most critical power skill to possess, according to professionals surveyed in the PMI Pulse of the Profession 2023 report.

Overall, 68 per cent of respondents said it was the most critical power skill -- followed by problem-solving (65 per cent), collaborative leadership (62 per cent), and strategic thinking (58 per cent).

Mastering such behaviours and core technical skills will make project professionals more valuable and probably less vulnerable in cases where the job market declines.

""The job market across sub-Saharan Africa has been experiencing a major boom, with project management skills in heavy demand,"" says Fatuma Haghe Adan, senior project manager at AI platform Sama in Nairobi, Kenya.

The demand for a project management skill set is evident in the experience of Kenya-based Wanja Murekio, an expert, who learned from a recruitment firm that ""project professionals have become one of the more expensive hires because demand is so high.""

No wonder there's a pervasive sense among project talent ""that things will get better in 2023,"" says Murekio, senior program manager, at Safaricom, Nairobi.

Google, for instance, opened a product development center in Nairobi in late 2022, just three years after building a major R&D complex in Ghana.

Microsoft recently launched its R&D facility in Nairobi, and Visa opened its first innovation center last year, aiming to create commerce and payment solutions across the continent.

Yet even as many companies buckle up to respond to this downturn, there's still a serious talent shortage.

A researcher at the University of Ottawa, Canada, revealed that most international development projects experience the same challenge because the project management methods used are inflexible.

According to the study, standard procedures -- such as those in World Bank projects -- do not regard the size and objectives of the project.

As such, project managers lack the flexibility to tailor their methods according to unique local contexts.

""There are non-traditional ways of acquiring skills demanded by the industry. The globally recognised credential, Certified Associate of Project Management (CAPM), is one such.

A project management certification gives one a competitive edge in the job market. Experience with AI or software development can likewise provide a boost, even for those positions not strictly in the IT sector.

Even so, the continent remains resilient with a stable outlook for 2023-2024, despite tightening global financial conditions, according to the African Development Bank.

Globally the signs of an economic winter are evident in figures from International Monetary Fund, which projects a 2.9 per cent growth this year.","{'uri': 'the-star.co.ke', 'dataType': 'news',

This follows a preliminary deal reached on Thursday by members of the European Parliament to push through the draft of the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act to a vote on May 11. Parliament will then thrash out the bill's final details with EU member states and the European Commission before it becomes law.

At a press conference after a Group of Seven digital ministers' meeting in Takasaki, Japan, Vestager said the EU AI Act was 'pro-innovation' since it seeks to mitigate the risks of societal damage from emerging technologies.

Regulators around the world have been trying to find a balance where governments could develop 'guardrails' on emerging artificial intelligence technology without stifling innovation.

'The reason why we have these guardrails for high-risk use cases is that cleaning up ... after a misuse by AI would be so much more expensive and damaging than the use case of AI in itself,' Vestager said.

While the EU AI Act is expected to be passed by this year, lawyers have said it will take a few years for it to be enforced. But Vestager said businesses could start considering the implication of the new legislation.

'There was no reason to hesitate and to wait for the legislation to be passed to accelerate the necessary discussions to provide the changes in all the systems where AI will have an enormous influence,' she told Reuters in an interview.

While research on AI has been going on for years, the sudden popularity of generative AI applications such as OpenAI'S ChatGPT and Midjourney have led to a scramble by lawmakers to find ways to regulate any uncontrolled growth.

An organization backed by Elon Musk and European lawmakers involved in drafting the EU AI Act are among those to have called for world leaders to collaborate to find ways to stop advanced AI from creating disruptions.

Digital ministers of the G-7 advanced nations on Sunday also agreed to adopt 'risk-based' regulation on AI, among the first steps that could lead to global agreements on how to regulate AI.

'It is important that our democracy paved the way and put in place the rules to protect us from its abusive manipulation - AI should be useful but it shouldn't be manipulating us,' said German Transport Minister Volker Wissing.

This year's G-7 meeting was also attended by representatives from Indonesia, India and Ukraine.","{'uri': 'kenyastar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Kenya Star', 'description': ""Kenya Star is the
