On the other hand, does he have a point?

So, here's the thing. As fans we've got the benefit of video replays and various angles of view etc. If we're honest, there were more than a few calls that didn't go the way of the Pacers across the last few games. Of course, the Pacers aren't the only team in the NBA or in professional sports for that matter who could sing that song.

That of course immediately leads to the the question of whether the Knicks would be 2-0 up in the series without the 'help' of officials. From where we're standing, that's not the case i.e., the team has simply handled its business, while the Pacers have not. To be clear that's not to say we haven't seen some strange decisions, but when all is said and done, you gotta handle your business.

At any rate, you can see below that one Knicks star had a diplomatic but fair response to the debate. With that, we're betting that his take will only serve to add fuel to the fire and that's something we're looking forward to watching tonight.

What are guests expected to wear?,"The annual fashion event's dress code will be: ""The Garden of Time"", taking inspiration from a short story of the same title, written by JG Ballard in 1962.

With May 6 upon us, that means celebrities are gearing up for one of fashion's biggest nights of the year: the 2024 Met Gala.

Each year, a new theme is introduced for the evening by Anna Wintour for the Costume Institute exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum.

This year, the annual Met Gala is based around the short story 'The Garden of Time', in celebration of the Costume Institute's new exhibition, ""Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.""

The The Metropolitan Museum say that the exhibit will showcase approximately 250 rare items, with many too fragile to be worn again - they are, according to Vogue, the 'sleeping beauties'. Many of the garments will be displayed digitally, using AI and CGI to preserve them.

Is there a dress code for the Met Gala?

JG Ballard's short story explores the concept of preservation using flowers as a symbol of beauty, youth and innocence as well as themes of decay, ruin, beauty and fragility.

What are guests expected to wear?

OK, but what does that mean? Well, Vogue also hand a nice explanation of how guests can turn that story into an outift: they say the best way to do so is by taking the theme of ""fleeting beauty"" with ""the most obvious interpretation would be to embrace the ""garden"" part of 'The Garden of Time'"".

They also add that ""we'd even encourage looks with real-life flowers, rotting preferably; essentially, you'll want to look like a walking memento mori"". Niche, I must say.

Flowers will undoubtedly play a key role at the Met Gala this year, as will time and music. Nature as a whole is encouraged by Vogue to be explored and finally, they mention that ""bygone fashion worth our attention"" is something that could be a showstopper.","[{'uri': 'joe_brennan@as.com', 'name': 'Joe Brennan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Met Gala'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Dress code'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'J.

In-form guard Jalen Brunson is questionable for Game 3 of the Knicks' Eastern Conference semi-final with the Indiana Pacers today, with New York explaining that the 27-year-old is dealing with ""soreness"" in his right foot.

The problem caused Brunson to miss a significant portion of the first half of the Knicks' Game 2 win over the Pacers on Wednesday. However, he returned after the break to play a crucial role in New York's 130-121 triumph at Madison Square Garden, finishing with 29 points as Tom Thibodeau's men took a 2-0 series lead.

Speaking post-game, Brunson struck a reassuring tone, telling reporters in the Big Apple: ""I'm all good - and that's it. I don't know [how the injury happened]. I just felt a little discomfort.""

Brunson starring for Knicks in postseason

Brunson has excelled in this year's NBA Playoffs, averaging 35.6 points and top-scoring for New York in each of their eight games so far. In Game 4 of the team's first-round series win over the Philadelphia 76ers, he registered a 47-point haul that is the highest by Knicks player in a postseason game.

Who else is on the Knicks' injury report?

The injury-hit Knicks will definitely be without Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mitchell Robinson and OG Anunoby against the Pacers today.

Randle has been out since January with a shoulder injury, and underwent season-ending surgery last month.

Bogdanovic sustained a foot injury during the 76ers series, and Robinson hasn't played since Game 1 against the Pacers due to an ankle problem. Both have been ruled out for the rest of the campaign.

Anunoby left Game 2 against Indiana with a hamstring strain, with NBC's Kurt Helin reporting that the 26-year-old is expected to be out for ""weeks, not days"".

Long-term casualty Julius Randle remains on the sidelines for the New York Knicks, as Tom Thibodeau's men take on the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of the teams' NBA Playoffs series.

The Knicks hold a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semi-final, after following up a 121-117 win in Monday's series opener with a 130-121 triumph in Game 2 on Wednesday.

Having secured back-to-back victories at Madison Square Gardens, New York now travel to Indianapolis for their first road game of the semi-final clash.

What injury does Randle have and when will he return?

Randle has been out since late January after dislocating his right shoulder in a regular-season win over the Miami Heat. Having initially sought to avoid surgery and make it back in time for the postseason, he was forced to undergo a campaign-ending operation in early April.

Announcing that Randle was to go under the knife, the Knicks said the 29-year-old forward would be ""re-evaluated in five months"".

Who else is on the Knicks' injury report?

New York are also without Bojan Bogdanovic, who sustained a foot injury during the first-round series against the Philadelphia 76ers; Mitchell Robinson, who hasn't appeared since Game 1 against the Pacers due to an ankle problem; and OG Anunoby, who left Game 2 with a hamstring strain. Bogdanovic and Robinson have both been ruled out for the rest of the season.

Meanwhile, Jalen Brunson has been listed as questionable for Game 3, as the 27-year-old deals with what is described as ""soreness"" in his right foot. Brunson has top-scored for the Knicks in every game so far in the postseason, averaging 35.6 points.

Medical or cosmetic? Let's take a look.

Jalen Brunson has been seen with his right hand taped up for several weeks - not such a big deal for a lefty but a strange sight to see the player with one hand bandaged and the other in a sleeve.

Brunson sprained his right hand in March but managed to complete 77 games during the regular season, ending with an average of 28.7 points, 3.7 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game. He was excluded for the last three games of the regular phase but that was more about giving him a chance to rest after a long campaign rather than any issues with his hand. The sprain was not considered serious enough to put him on the injury list and being left-handed, it wouldn't affect his shooting anyway. ""I'm able to do whatever I need to do,"" he explained at the start of April.

Jalen Brunson equals NBA postseason feats

He has continued to play with his hand strapped up and has been one of Tom Thibodeau's most-used players. It hasn't cramped his style at all - in fact, since he hurt his hand, his performance figures have gone through the roof. During the postseason, Brunson has averaged 35.6 points, 8.1 assists and 4.4 rebounds in eight games and finished with 40+ points in four of them. He became the first player since Michael Jordan, 30 years ago, to score 40+ points in four consecutive playoff games and the first in history with 40+ points and five assists in four straight postseason games.

Brunson, first his hand, now his foot

So Jalen continues with his taped up hand. We don't know the severity of it but judging by the length of time he has had his hand bandaged, it could either be a Grade II sprain, which can take between six and 12 weeks to heal or a Grade III, which can take several months to sort itself out.

That's the least of his worries right now, Brunson is listed as questionable for Game 3 against the Pacers. Apparently, he finished Game 2 with soreness to his right foot and his situation is being monitored day-to-day.

OG Anunoby is certain to miss tonight's game at Gainbridge Fieldhouse with a low-grade muscle sprain. Anunoby injured his left hamstring in the second half of the second game against Indiana and is expected to be out for the next fortnight, which means he will miss the remainder of this series but could be back for the finals, if the Knicks progress.","[{'uri': 'andy_hall@as.com', 'name': 'Andy Hall', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Jalen Brunson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Assist (basketball)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Major League Baseball postseason'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'New York Knicks'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rebound (basketball)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sprain'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'National Basketball Association'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Gainbridge Fieldhouse'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Indiana Pacers'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Michael Jordan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Hamstring'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'O.G.
