The pregame narrative: Madrid took a commanding 5-2 aggregate lead at Anfield and are now -10,000 to advance. Liverpool have been an awful road team all season and we don't expect that to change come Wednesday. We're also backing two young stars -- Cody Gakpo and Rodrygo -- to register shots on target.

Check out our best Liverpool vs. Real Madrid picks for the round of 16 fixture on March 15.

Liverpool have pulled off miraculous Champions League comebacks before -- we're looking at you Barcelona -- but don't count on that come Wednesday.

The Reds have been truly awful on the road this season, losing 10 of 19 fixtures across all competitions. They've been on a particularly poor run of form since the New Year with a 2-1-5 road record, being outscored by seven goals in those fixtures.

Liverpool most recently lost 1-0 away to Bournemouth in the Premier League, and Real Madrid laps that side in terms of talent.

The fact that Madrid crushed Liverpool 5-2 in the opening leg should speak for itself, but we think things could get even worse now that the Spanish giants are playing in front of their home fans.

Real Madrid have won all three of their Champions League home games this season by a combined score of 9-2. But that shouldn't be a surprise considering the Whites always dominate at the Bernabeu.

They were 4-0-2 at home in the Champions League last season with a plus-five goal differential.

Key stat: Madrid have won four of their last five games against Liverpool.

Gakpo over 0.5 SOT (-124) : We don't think Liverpool will muster much offence but are content in backing one of their young stars to register a shot on target.

Gakpo was brought in from PSV Eindhoven in the winter transfer window and has made an immediate impact. He's registered a shot on target in half of his 12 starts for Liverpool with a total of eight SOT in that span.

Rodrygo over 0.5 SOT (-105) : Madrid's 22-year-old phenom has solidified his spot in the starting lineup and is rounding into solid form.

He's registered a shot on target in three of his last five starts with six total SOT in that span.

Rodrygo seems to be at his best when playing at the Bernabeu. He's put at least one shot on net in five of his last six home starts.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Single-elimination tournament'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Real Madrid CF'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Liverpool'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Liverpool'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'UEFA Champions League'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Madrid'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Madrid'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Spain'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Two-legged tie'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cody Gakpo'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Anfield'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rodrygo'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'AFC Bournemouth'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Premier League'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'FC Barcelona'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'PSV Eindhoven'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Goal difference'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernabéu_Stadium', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Santiago Bernabéu Stadium'}, 'location': None}]",https://images.thestar.com/dp8i8TPzauNNsT6_UER_DCwP470=/1280x1024/smart/filters:cb(1678806403568):format(webp)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/sports/sports-betting/2023/03/14/liverpool-vs-real-madrid-picks-and-odds-expect-madrid-to-cruise-in-the-champions-league-match/2023-03-CP166121047.jpg,eng-8470041,-0.03529411764705881,416502900,1,thestar.com,news,The Star,Single-elimination tournament Real Madrid CF Liverpool UEFA Champions League Madrid Two-legged tie Cody Gakpo Anfield Rodrygo AFC Bournemouth Premier League FC Barcelona PSV Eindhoven Goal difference Santiago Bernabéu Stadium,Canada,CA,,,Liberal,ChatGPT,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,13.0,18.0,14.0,12.0,10.0,13.0,13.0,15.0,32.0,13.0,32.0,17.0,20.0,39.0,80.0,52.0,48.0,36.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,15,15,03-14
