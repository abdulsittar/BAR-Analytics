The February 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria ""now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected"" for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.

* Turkey arrests contractors as earthquake deaths pass 33,000

* Survivors of Turkey-Syria earthquake struggle to stay warm and fed

It took a week for the UN and Syria's President Bashar Assad's government to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.

""Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,"" commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva.

He added that ""we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria"".

""Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said. ""Actors didn't rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria, which became the epicentre of neglect.""

A week after the earthquake, the UN announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open, for three months, two new crossing points from Turkey to the country's rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims.

Before that, the UN had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia's insistence.

""They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said, adding that ""Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who [are] supposed to protect them in their most desperate time"".

""Many voices are rightly calling ... for an investigation and accountability to understand how this failure, this disaster happened beyond the earthquake,"" Pinheiro said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Moment magnitude scale'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ceasefire'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Independent'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Aftershock'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bashar al-Assad'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Switzerland'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Syria'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicenter', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Epicenter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlib', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Idlib'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}]",https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/4/z/3/l/d/7/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.4z3td2.png/1678721424763.jpg,eng-8471915,0.07450980392156858,416418360,1,stuff.co.nz,news,Stuff,Earthquake United Nations Turkey Syria International community Moment magnitude scale Ceasefire The Independent Aftershock Bashar al-Assad Humanitarian aid Geneva President of Syria Epicenter Idlib Russia,New-Zealand,NZ,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C4,C2,Australia,AU,Irreligion,10.0,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,,,,,Pacific Islands Forum (PIF),PIF,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,46,15,2023-03-13

The Commission of Inquiry on Syria pointed to ""failures that hindered the delivery of urgent and lifesaving aid"" to the largely opposition-held northwest region, in the days after the 6 February quakes.

Humanitarian assessments point to more than 7,000 people killed in Syria by the natural disaster.

At a press conference in Geneva, chairperson of the inquiry, Paulo Pinheiro, backed calls for a probe into alleged delays in getting aid and rescue equipment to those affected.

The people of Syria had ""a right to the truth"", the veteran rights experts insisted, adding that it was also in the interests of ""international good practice"", so that mistakes could be identified and avoided in future.

""They have the right to know what exactly happened for not receiving (help) immediately,"" he said, adding that Syrian people in the affected areas remained ""completely appalled by this incapacity of the international organizations to come to their support and aid"" because three days after the disaster ""a lot of people could survive if there was a fast, immediate reaction of the international community and the United Nations"".

According to the Commission of Inquiry's latest report into the Syrian crisis, parties to the 12-year-old conflict continued to commit ""widespread human rights violations and abuses"" in the months leading up to the earthquake tragedy.

Hostilities even continued in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the Commissioners said, ""even in the very areas devastated by the earthquakes. These include last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid.""

Highlighting the delays in securing international aid access from Türkiye to the stricken northwest, the Commission of Inquiry report noted that the Syrian Government required ""a full week to consent to life-saving cross-border aid access"".

Cross-line aid deliveries were also ""impeded"" by the Government and the opposition Syrian National Army (SNA), the independent investigators said, adding that the non-state armed group Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) in northwest Syria also ""refused cross-line aid from Damascus"".

With entire communities in Syria's northwest destroyed by last month's ""exceptional"" disaster, Commissioner Hanny Megally explained how they had pleaded for assistance.

""People were saying, 'We need heavy equipment, we need search teams with dogs, people are still alive under the rubble. Where's the UN, where's the international community to help us?' And they could see not far away the same earthquake, lots of international assistance being provided on the Turkish side of the border whereas they're all waiting for something that did not transpire.""

It's estimate that five million people require basic shelter and non-food assistance in the Syrian part of the earthquake zone.

Already before the 6 February earthquakes, more than 15 million Syrians - more than at any point since the start of the conflict - needed humanitarian assistance.

Although there were ""many acts of heroism amid the suffering"" after the earthquake, Commissioner Paulo Pinheiro insisted that the Syrian people ""in the most dire need"" had been failed by their Government, the international community and the UN.

""Syrians now need a comprehensive ceasefire that is fully respected, for civilians - including aid workers - to be safe,"" he said, before adding that the Commission of Inquiry was now investigating fresh attacks ""including last week's reported Israeli attack on Aleppo international airport, a conduit for humanitarian aid"".",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Earthquake'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Human Rights Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Natural disaster'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Geneva'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Switzerland'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_National_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian National Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrian Civil War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrians', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Syrians'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International organization'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Human rights'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Humanitarian aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_al-Sham', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Tahrir al-Sham'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International airport'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ceasefire'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Independence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Damascus'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Aleppo'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Syria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}]",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,eng-8471915,-0.207843137254902,416427600,1,scoop.co.nz,news,Scoop,Earthquake Syria International community United Nations United Nations Human Rights Council Natural disaster Geneva Syrian National Army Syrian Civil War Syrians Aid International organization Human rights Humanitarian aid Tahrir al-Sham International airport Ceasefire Independence Damascus Aleppo Turkey Israel,New-Zealand,NZ,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C4,C2,Australia,AU,Irreligion,10.0,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,best,low,high,high,low,low,high,,,,,Pacific Islands Forum (PIF),PIF,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,20,18,2023-03-13
