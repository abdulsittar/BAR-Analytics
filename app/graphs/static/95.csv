Many of these systems can be classified as complex systems, with interdependencies, emergent behaviors and a diversity of actors involved. As AI is increasingly introduced into these systems, we witness a transformation from complex systems into complex intelligent systems. At the same time caution is invoked toward the risks of AI regarding e.g., biases and loss of control as more tasks are transferred to AI. Hence, the introduction of AI into complex systems is associated with uncertainties around management of AI initiatives and their influence on future systems. Challenges like this can affect many different functions and professions and thus need to be understood collectively.The aim of this thesis is to examine how the actors' prospective collective sensemaking processes in developing complex systems are affected by AI introduction. Previous research within complex systems literature shows important aspects regarding sensemaking of the system and situations within operations of complex systems. However, sensemaking in the development process of complex systems has been less studied. By examining the introduction of AI in complex systems development this thesis explores collective prospective sensemaking processes in the development of complex intelligent systems.To study an emerging phenomenon like AI introduction in complex systems, an explorative case study was found suitable. The case chosen for the study was a cross-organizational development project of an AI-tool based on Machine Learning for planning of energy systems to be used in the urban planning process of new city districts. This setting revealed plenty prospective and collective sensemaking occasions around AI introduction and exhibited continuous engagement in prospective collective sensemaking relating to the development of the AI tool and the imagined use of the AI tool in the system, which have been reported in the two appended papers. The first paper showed misalignment between actors' sensemaking processes that alternated between seeking and disengaging behaviors. It also identified the use of boundary objects to retain disengaged actors and raised considerations around the level of detail of the boundary objects in relation to the sensemaking behaviors. The second paper identified dependencies between near- and distant-sensemaking loops that highlight challenges to connect retrospective insights with prospective imaginations by action in the present. In the creation of complex intelligent systems, human involvement seems inevitable, and the second paper exposes how AI can augment human cognition and organizational capabilities for creative imagination around possible and desirable distant-future scenarios.This thesis extends previous research on prospective and collective sensemaking in the development process of complex intelligent systems by presenting a framework of near and distant future sensemaking and internal and external complexity. This provided new insights of how knowledge flows over system levels and how to use boundary objects throughout such projects. Insight that can be useful for management of purposeful AI introduction in complex systems and society. Moreover, it contributes with an empirical case of AI introduction in complex systems to the innovation management literature.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Sensemaking'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Complex system'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Artificial intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Emergence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sustainability'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Machine learning'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Urban planning'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Insight'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Empirical evidence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cognition'}}]",,eng-9486604,0.082352941,451297494,1,avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,Sensemaking Complex system Artificial intelligence Emergence Sustainability Machine learning Urban planning Insight Empirical evidence Cognition,avhandlingar.se,513,NLP,2024,4,20,24,8,2024-04-20
