Kohli achieved the landmark on Day 3 of the fourth and final Test of Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Ahmedabad.

The maestro hit 59 not out to end his half-century drought in the longest format. Kohli's last fifty came back in January 2022.

With the unbeaten half-century Kohli went past Lara's record of most runs against Australia.

Kohli, who loves playing against Australia now has 4,729 runs in 89 matches across formats. The 34-year-old has scored these runs at an average of 50.84 and has 15 tons and 24 fifties to his name with the best individual score of 169.

Lara, on the other hand, scored 4,714 runs in 82 matches (Tests and ODIs) against Australia. He notched up 12 tons with the best score of 277.

The leading run-scorer against Australia is legendary Sachin Tendulkar. In 110 matches and 144 innings, Tendulkar scored 6,707 runs at an average of 49.68. With 20 tons and 31 fifties, Sachin had the best individual score of 241* against the Aussies.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lara', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Brian Lara'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'West Indies'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Not out'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}]","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98570355,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-42890,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",eng-8469535,0.2549019607843137,416251500,1,timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,Virat Kohli Australia Brian Lara Border–Gavaskar Trophy International cricket West Indies Batting (cricket) Test cricket Ahmedabad Delhi Not out Innings Sachin Tendulkar One Day International,India,IN,,,Center-right,ChatGPT,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,11,25,17,2023-03-11

Kohli looked completely control throughout the final session and went on to score his first Test half century in 16 innings. With the pitch expected to continue to be good for batters, the former India captain will be hoping that he can convert this into a first Test century in nearly four years.

Kohli went past 4000 Test runs in India over the course of his innings. He became the third fastest to reach the mark in the country, having got there in 77 innings, and thus went past current India head coach Rahul Dravid (88) and the legendary Sunil Gavaskar (87). Kohli needed 42 runs to reach the milestone and he got there in the final session with a boundary off Nathan Lyon. Kohli also has an average of 58.82 in India, which is the highest among batters who have scored 4000 Test runs in the country.

Interestingly enough, Kohli had also made a move in another big list which went rather unnoticed compared to his milestone for runs in India and the fact that this was his first Test half century in nearly 14 months. Kohli surpassed West Indies legend Brian Lara to become the second-highest scorer against Australia in international cricket.

In 89 matches and 104 innings, the 34-year-old has scored 4729 runs at an average of 50.84. He has scored 15 centuries and 24 fifties against the Aussies, with the best individual score of 169. Lara on the other hand, had scored 4714 runs in 82 matches and 108 innings against Australia with 12 centuries and 26 half centuries against them. His highest score against them is 277 which he made at the SCG in a drawn Test match in 1993.

The leading run-scorer against Australia is the legendary former India captain Sachin Tendulkar. In 110 matches and 144 innings, Tendulkar scored 6,707 runs at an average of 49.68. He has a total of 20 centuries and 31 half-centuries against Aussies, with the best individual score of 241 not out.

Kohli has not scored a Test century since November 2019, when he made 136 against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens in India's first-ever pink ball Test. He, in fact, went on a drought of international centuries, and a general dip in form in all formats, after that ton and broke that run only with his first ever T20I century at the 2022 Asia Cup last year. Since then, Kohli turned in a stellar performance at the T20 World Cup and then went on a run of scoring three centuries in four ODI matches. However, he continues to search for his best form in Test cricket and would be hoping that with the conditions being conducive for batting in Ahmedabad, he can do that on Sunday.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lara', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Brian Lara'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rahul Dravid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'West Indies cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Cricket_Ground', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney Cricket Ground'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Eden Gardens'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket World Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/11/1600x900/ANI-20230311215-0_1678557949686_1678557949686_1678557985478_1678557985478.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1137254901960785,416282280,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Cricket pitch Captain (cricket) Australia Brian Lara Sunil Gavaskar Nathan Lyon Rahul Dravid International cricket West Indies cricket team Sachin Tendulkar Asia Cup Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Century (cricket) Sydney Cricket Ground Eden Gardens Cricket World Cup Batting (cricket) One Day International Twenty20 International Twenty20 Ahmedabad,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,58,1,2023-03-12

Virat accomplished this landmark during India's fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Ahmedabad. The star batter ended his Test half-century drought which started in January 2022, ending the third day of play unbeaten at 59* in 128 balls, consisting of five fours. Virat loves playing against Australia and has numbers to prove it. In 89 matches and 104 innings, he has scored 4,729 runs at an average of 50.84. He has scored 15 tons and 24 fifties against the Aussies, with the best individual score of 169.

Lara on the other hand, has scored 4,714 runs in 82 matches and 108 innings against Australia. He has scored 12 centuries and 26 innings against them, with the best score of 277.

The leading run-scorer against Australia is legendary Indian batter Sachin Tendulkar. In 110 matches and 144 innings, Tendulkar has scored 6,707 runs at an average of 49.68. He has a total of 20 tons and 31 fifties against Aussies, with the best individual score of 241*.

Coming to the match, a hard-hitting century from opener Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli's half-century helped India end the third day of play of the fourth and final Test against Australia at Ahmedabad on a high, with the scoreboard reading 289/3 at the end of the final session of day three on Saturday.

At the end of the final session, Virat (59*) and Jadeja (16*) were unbeaten. However, India still has a mountain to climb as they trail by 191 runs in the match.

Skipper Rohit Sharma (35) and Pujara also made valuable contributions.

The spin trio of Nathan Lyon, Matthew Kuhnemann and Todd Murphy got a wicket each.

Earlier in their first innings, Australia was bundled out for 480 runs. Centuries from Usman Khawaja (180) and all-rounder Cameron Green (114) helped the Aussies reach such a massive total. Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers for India, taking 6/91 on a surface offering no help to spinners.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lara', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Brian Lara'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'West Indies cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Not out'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'All-rounder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rohit Sharma'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}]","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-03/6imj6c5g_virat-kohli_625x300_11_March_23.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=675",eng-8469535,0.3254901960784313,416284680,1,sports.ndtv.com,news,NDTVSports.com,Innings Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) Test cricket India Australia Brian Lara Border–Gavaskar Trophy International cricket West Indies cricket team Boundary (cricket) Not out Sachin Tendulkar Ahmedabad Nathan Lyon Usman Khawaja Ravichandran Ashwin All-rounder Spin bowling Rohit Sharma Wicket,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,38,2,2023-03-12

Jadeja was outfoxed by Todd Murphy, who enticed the Indian southpaw to play an extravagant shot in the 107th over of the innings at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Sunday.

A mere spectator at the non-striker's end, former Indian skipper Kohli was not pleased with Jadeja after the stat batter's ambitious attempt to attack Murphy backfired in the opening session of the day's play at Ahmedabad. While Kohli cut a frustrated figure, batting legend Sunil Gavaskar slammed Jadeja on-air after India lost its fourth wicket while replying to Australia's gigantic first innings total of 480. ""He has given Australia a wicket on the platter,"" said Harsha Bhogle, who was on commentary duty when Jadeja's patient knock of 28 off 84 balls came to an end. Launching an attack on the star all-rounder, former India skipper Gavaskar opined that head coach Rahul Dravid will not be impressed with Jadeja's shot selection.

""What has happened? Did somebody say anything to him? Suddenly in this particular over, he has gone the aerial route - even the boundary that he hit was uppish, Look at that, Kohli is not impressed, and the change room is not gonna be impressed I can tell you that. Rahul Dravid, the coach, is not gonna be impressed with this shot. And he has played such responsible innings before this. Therefore, this is a shot, hard to understand,"" Gavaskar thundered on-air during the match commentary on Star Sports.

Prior to his dismissal, Jadeja played a couple of shots that were completely out of character. The star batter had welcomed Murphy with a boundary by clearing the fielder at mid-off. However, Murphy had the last laugh as the Australian bowler picked up the wicket of Jadeja on the final ball of the same over. India were reduced to 309-4 in 107 overs after Jadeja's dismissal.

Jadeja has been in fine form throughout the four-match Test series between India and Australia. After a long break from international cricket, Jadeja made a sensational comeback by leading India to a famous win in the series opener against Australia at Nagpur.

Ravindra Jadeja once again showcased a great example of resilience while batting against Australia in the fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Ahmedabad. After getting promoted to no. 5 in the order, the ace all-rounder looked extremely formidable and, in fact, stitched a 55-run stand with Virat Kohli for the fourth wicket. He was expected to notch another crucial half-century in this series, given the way he was dealing with the Aussie bowlers. But unfortunately, the fans couldn't witness his epic sword celebration which he brings out after getting a fifty. Jadeja's gritty innings ended following a half-hearted lofted shot which also left the commentators baffled.

Jadeja looked to shift gears as he faced Matthew Kuhnemann in the morning session. He began the 107 over with a lofted boundary and a delivery later, he went uppish but couldn't time his shot. Off the final ball, Jadeja looked to go aerial again but this time, he found Usman Khawaja at mid-on. It was a tossed-up delivery from Kuhnemann, Jadeja looked to replicate his previous shot but holed it up.

Kohli, who was stationed at the non-striker's end, was visibly disappointed with Jadeja and so were the commentators.

Veteran broadcaster Harsha Bhogle said Jadeja just gifted his wicket to the Aussies.

""In the last couple of deliveries, Ravindra Jadeja has played shots out of his character. He has given Australia a wicket on a platter,"" Bhogle said on air.

""What has happened to him? Did anyone say anything to him? In this particular over, he has looked to take the aerial route. The boundary he hit was uppish. Look at this, what is this shot,"" Gavaskar opined.

""Kohli is not impressed. The change room is not going to be impressed, I can tell you that. Rahul Dravid, the coach, will not be going to be impressed with this shot. And he has played such responsible innings before this. Therefore, this is a shot hard to understand,"" he added.

A few overs later, former India head coach Ravi Shastri, who is also a part of the commentary panel, explained why Jadeja was tempted to play that kind of a shot.

""One of the reasons why he was struggling was Murphy's pace. Jadeja is someone who likes to go down the track and hit over the top. But here, he is not just allowed to chip down because of the pace. He has to hit it from where he is. And the intention was always to hit over the in-field,"" Shastri said on air.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'All-rounder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsha_Bhogle', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Harsha Bhogle'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rahul Dravid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}]",https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/03/virat-kohli-looks-annoyed-after-jadejas-dismissal.jpg,eng-8469535,0.003921568627450966,416297400,1,news18.com,news,News18,Ravindra Jadeja Virat Kohli Australia national cricket team Wicket Test cricket Border–Gavaskar Trophy All-rounder Innings Batting (cricket) Ahmedabad Harsha Bhogle Usman Khawaja Fielding (cricket) India Ravi Shastri Rahul Dravid Over (cricket) Shreyas Iyer Australia,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,10,6,2023-03-12

At the lunch break, India's score read 362/4, hosts trail by 118 runs.

The batting pair of Ravindra Jadeja and Virat Kohli were decisive in their approach and made the Australian bowlers toil hard making merry of the excellent batting conditions on offer.

Australia skipper Steve Smith introduced Cameron Green into the attack in the very first over of day 4 and the bowler concede just 4 runs. Australia started with spin with Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy bowling in tandem from both ends.

The duo of Jadeja and Kohli took India's total beyond the 300-run mark in the 102nd over of the game. However, the 64-run partnership stand was broken by Murphy who dismissed Jadeja for 28 runs. Srikar Bharat then came out to bat.

The Indian batters rotated the strike brilliantly, not allowing the Australian bowlers to settle down while whacking the loose balls on offer.

Kohli and Bharat both were aggressors of the batting pair, smashing boundaries regularly. The duo stitched a solid 50-run partnership for Team India.

The Indian pair remained unbeaten as the hosts ended the session beyond the 350-run mark with Kohli (88)* and Bharat (25)* at the crease.

Brief Score: Australia 480 (Usman Khawaja 180, Cameron Green 114; Ravichandran Ashwin 6-91) vs India 362/4 (Shubman Gill 128*, Virat Kohli 88*; Todd Murphy 2-64).

The pitch hasn't been easy for scoring with only 73 runs scored off 32 overs in the morning session. Kohli (88 batting) added 29 runs to his overnight score of 59 not out with India still 118 runs behind Australia's first innings score of 480.

With Shreyas Iyer unlikely to bat due to recurrence of a lower back injury, K.S. Bharat was promoted up the order and he did his case no harm with an unbeaten 25 off 70 balls.

The wicket-keeper also shared an unbroken 53-run stand with the former India captain.

Bharat, in fact, played the best shot of the morning, a slog sweep over cow corner off Nathan Lyon for a six.

The only wicket that India lost during the session was of Ravindra Jadeja (28 off 84 balls), who failed to clear Usman Khawaja at mid-on off Todd Murphy (2/64 in 32 overs).

Kohli has put his head down during his 220-ball knock and it did allow the Australians to control the proceedings on a slow deck. The only time he got closest to hitting a boundary was a flick through mid-wicket off Cameron Green but Mitchell Starc cut it down to three runs.

He was then happy getting the occasional single and double to keep the scoreboard moving.

Bharat, who has had a wretched time with the bat in the series so far, did look way more confident on a flat track and was more assured in his defence.

He put a big stride forward to negate the little bit of turn that was on offer for the Australian spinners.

The only one who got a couple of deliveries to break back sharply was Lyon (1/99 in 49 overs).

Image: Twitter screengrab

Veteran India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was among the runs during the ongoing fourth Test between India and Australia in Ahmedabad, playing a patient knock of 28 off 84 deliveries.

Follow LIVE: India vs Australia 4th Test, Day 4

Jadeja came into bat an number five, following Shubman Gill's dismissal on Day three of the Test on Saturday, and forged a 64-run stand with Virat Kohli for the fourth wicket, before being dismissed by Todd Murphy in the 107 over.

While he got off to a patient start, he could not convert that into a big knock, but his runs came still valuable for India, who are looking to eclipse Australia's total of 480 in the first innings.

Jadeja got dismissed in the last ball of the 107 over, when he tried to lift it down the ground, but did not get the desired elevation and eventually holed out to Usman Khawaja at mid-on.

Kohli, at the other end, was seemingly miffed at Jadeja's dismissal, and a video of the former skipper's reaction has gone viral on Twitter.

The commentators, too, were disappointed with the way Jadeja got out.

""In the last couple of deliveries, Ravindra Jadeja has played shots out of his character. He has given Australia a wicket on a platter,"" senior commentator Harsha Bhogle said on air.

""What has happened to him? Did anyone say anything to him? In this particular over, he has looked to take the aerial route. The boundary he hit was uppish. Look at this, what is this shot,"" Gavaskar commented.

""Kohli is not impressed. The change room is not going to be impressed, I can tell you that. Rahul Dravid, the coach, will not be going to be impressed with this shot. And he has played such responsible innings before this. Therefore, this is a shot hard to understand,"" he added.

Ravi Shastri, who is also a part of the commentary panel, explained Ravindra Jadeja's dismissal.

""One of the reasons why he was struggling was Murphy's pace. Jadeja is someone who likes to go down the track and hit over the top. But here, he is not just allowed to chip down because of the pace. He has to hit it from where he is. And the intention was always to hit over the in-field,"" the former India coach said on air.

India were 362/4 at lunch on Day 4, with Virat Kohli (88*) and KS Bharat (25*) still at the crease. India lead the four-match series 2-1, having retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, but will need to win the match in order to confirm qualification for the World Test Championship (WTC) final in June.

Should India lose or draw this match, they should hope that Sri Lanka fail to complete a clean sweep over New Zealand in the two-match Test series in Kiwiland. Australia have already qualified for the showpiece event in London, having won the third Test by nine wickets.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'All-rounder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsha_Bhogle', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Harsha Bhogle'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rahul Dravid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Crease (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'London'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'London'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}}}]",https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/300x300/fixed/jpg/scalex16x9/2023/03/Kohli-4th-Test-640_Twitter-screengrab.jpg,eng-8469535,-0.003921568627450966,416300700,1,firstpost.com,news,Firstpost,Ravindra Jadeja Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia All-rounder Innings Cricket bat Wicket Shubman Gill Ahmedabad Harsha Bhogle Usman Khawaja Fielding (cricket) Ravi Shastri Border–Gavaskar Trophy Rahul Dravid ICC World Test Championship Crease (cricket) New Zealand national cricket team London Sri Lanka,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,5,7,2023-03-12

Virat Kohli sedately inched towards his first Test hundred since November 2019 as India reached 362 for four at lunch on day four of the fourth Test against Australia here on Sunday.

The pitch hasn't been easy for scoring with only 73 runs scored off 32 overs in the morning session.

Kohli (88 batting) added 29 runs to his overnight score of 59 not out with India still 118 runs behind Australia's first innings score of 480.

With Shreyas Iyer unlikely to bat due to recurrence of a lower back injury, Kona Bharat was promoted up the order and he did his case no harm with an unbeaten 25 off 70 balls.

The wicket-keeper also shared an unbroken 53-run stand with the former India captain.

Bharat, in fact, played the best shot of the morning, a slog sweep over cow corner off Nathan Lyon for a six.

The only wicket that India lost during the session was of Ravindra Jadeja (28 off 84 balls), who failed to clear Usman Khawaja at mid-on off Todd Murphy (2/64 in 32 overs).

Kohli has put his head down during his 220-ball knock and it did allow the Australians to control the proceedings on a slow deck. The only time he got closest to hitting a boundary was a flick through mid-wicket off Cameron Green but Mitchell Starc cut it down to three runs.

He was then happy getting the occasional single and double to keep the scoreboard moving.

Bharat, who has had a wretched time with the bat in the series so far, did look way more confident on a flat track and was more assured in his defence.

He put a big stride forward to negate the little bit of turn that was on offer for the Australian spinners.

Kohli was unbeaten on 88, and wicketkeeper-batsman Srikar Bharat was batting on 25 as they built an unbroken partnership of 53 runs for the fifth wicket.

As has been the story of this Test match, the overnight Indian batsmen accumulated runs instead of getting runs at good pace. In 32 overs bowled in the morning session, India made 73 runs by losing one wicket.

Ravindra Jadeja lost his patience and was caught at mid-on by Usman Khawaja off right-arm off-spinner Todd Murphy for 28 runs, after stitching 53 runs partnership with Kohli for the fourth wicket.

Surprisingly, Bharat walked in before Shreyas Iyer who was taken for scans following complaints of pain in the lower back. The keeper bided his time after he slog swept Nathan Lyon for a six.

Runs came in trickles as the Australian bowling has been very seasoned and animated captaincy from Steve Smith. It has not been easy for the Indian batsmen to score runs freely and at a fast rate.

All the focus will be on Kohli in the post-lunch session as he is on the verge of ending his drought of centuries since November 2019.

Brief Scores: Australia 480 (Usman Khawaja 180, Cameron Green 114; R Ashwin 6-91) lead India 362/4 (Shubman Gill 128, Virat Kohli 88*, Cheteshwar Pujara 42; Todd Murphy 2-64) by 118 runs.

The last hundred Kohli scored was against Bangladesh in the pink ball Test at the Eden Gardens in November 2019.

Three years and four months later, Virat Kohli has gotten the monkey off his back by scoring his 28th Test century in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia. This is Kohli's first Test century since November 23, 2019 - and after 1205 days - which finally puts an end to the former India captain's unusually long wait for a three-figure score. Last year, Kohli snapped his century-less streak with a hundred each in T20Is and ODIs, and then added a 74th earlier this year against Sri Lanka in an ODI. And today, on a bright and sunny Day 4 of the Ahmedabad Test, Kohli finally buried the ghosts of his torrid run in Tests with a century that he will remember for a long time.

This is also Kohli's first 50-plus score since January of 2022 - where he scored 79 against South Africa in Cape Town. With this knock, Kohli has replicated a special feat, one that the legendary Sunil Gavaskar achieved 40 years ago. Playing his 50th Test at home in 1983, Gavaskar scored a century, while batting at No. 4. Surprisingly enough, this too is Kohli's 50th Test on home soil, and like Gavaskar, he celebrated it with a century.

The only difference in that was Gavaskar's 14th ton at home, while Kohli enjoyed his 13th. This is also Kohli's 8th Test century against Australia, tying Gavaskar for the joint second-most tons by an Indian player against the Aussies, next only to Sachin Tendulkar.

Kohli began the session positively but later went into a shell. It is worth noting that Kohli's first boundary of the day came seven balls before the end of first session. On the best batting pitch of the series, Kohli was a tad under pressure, but then grew in confidence. There were a couple of nervy moments both Day 3 and 4 - he was squared up by a turning delivery from Matthew Kuhnemann and overcame a couple of LBW shouts with the impact clearly being outside off.

Kohli remained unbeaten on 88 at lunch, having faced 220 deliveries. Scoring at a strike-rate of 40 is not one would usually associate with Kohli but such is the situation of the game. With India in no rush, Kohli was happy to bide his time as India scored 73 runs off 32 overs losing one wicket - that of Ravindra Jadeja. After lunch though, the pace of the innings picked up. KS Bharat switched gears and launched Cameron Green for 6, 6, and 4 in a 21-run over - the costliest of the series. This meant that Kohli remained content as he dealt in singles to carefully thread through the 90s.

With Kohli on 98, India lost their fifth wicket with KS Bharat inside edging the ball onto his pads and in the air for Peter Handscomb to complete an easy catch at forward short leg, but that didn't deter Kohli as in the next two overs, he nudged a couple of singles to complete his 75th international ton, raise his bat, take his helmet off and soak in the electric atmosphere of the stadium.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2016', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cape Town'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Cape Town'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Leg before wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

Kohli, who last scored a Test century on November 22, 2019 during a day-night Test against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, took 241 deliveries to reach triple figures. This was Kohli's 75th century in international ton, and it has put India in a strong position in the match.

Earlier, India managed just 73 runs in 32 overs of the morning session after losing overnight batsman Ravindra Jadeja for 28.

Kohli went past 80 for the first time since his Test ton drought, with his previous highest score of 79 in South Africa in January 2022.

Kohli and the left-handed Jadeja started cautiously against a persistent spin attack with Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy -- both of whom bowled for most of the morning session -- keeping up the pressure.

Jadeja largely remained defensive in his knock but suddenly decided to attack Murphy in one over. His adventure lasted five balls as he chipped the last one to mid-on to get caught.

Kohli kept up the grind alongside wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat, who was sent in because Shreyas Iyer went for scans after he complained of lower back pain following day three's play.

Batting superstar Virat Kohli has finally ended his wait for a century in Test cricket on Sunday when he scored his 28th such score in the format during the ongoing fourth match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy against Australia in Ahmedabad. Since his 136 against Bangladesh during the Kolkata Test in 2019, Kohli was going through a century drought, across formats, which he ended last year at Asia Cup with a maiden T20I hundred.

Then during the Bangladesh tour in December last year, he scored his first ODI century since August 2019. However, he had to wait a little longer (compared to limited-overs cricket) for the wait to end in Tests returning disappointed from the Bangladesh Test series where 24 was his highest score across four innings.

Follow: IND vs AUS 4th Test, Day 4

And when Australia came home, he managed 12, 44, 20, 22 and 13 in the five innings he batted during the first three Tests on challenging pitches.

Ahmedabad presented the batters with the best conditions to showcase their talent after spinners ruled the roost in Nagpur, Delhi and Indore. It was Australia opener Usman Khawaja who first dazzled with a patient century before allrounder Cameron Green got a maiden Test ton.

On Saturday, it was the turn of talented Shubman Gill to grab the spotlight as he scored a strokeful century - his second of Test career and first on Indian soil.

And on Sunday, Kohli got the monkey off his back as he continued a solid progress towards the three-digit score delighting the fans at the Narendra Modi Stadium when he reached the milestone.

Kohli thus drew level with Hashim Amla and Michael Clarke in the list of most Test centuries to jointly occupy the 17th spot. Overall, it's the 75th century of his international career and he's only behind the legendary Sachin Tendulkar who holds the all-time record with 100 hundreds.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladesh'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladesh'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Limited overs cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashim_Amla', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Hashim Amla'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Clarke_(cricketer)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Michael Clarke (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'All-rounder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/03/virat-kohli-scores-a-test-hundred-after-more-than-three-years.jpg,eng-8469535,0.01960784313725483,416301600,1,news18.com,news,News18,Virat Kohli Test cricket Australia Border–Gavaskar Trophy Asia Cup Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Innings Ahmedabad Kolkata Bangladesh Batting (cricket) Limited overs cricket One Day International Twenty20 International Hashim Amla Michael Clarke (cricketer) Usman Khawaja Narendra Modi Stadium All-rounder Spin bowling Sachin Tendulkar Shreyas Iyer Shubman Gill Delhi Indore Nagpur,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,20,7,2023-03-12

And after opener Shubman Gill ensured that with a classy century on Day 3, it was Virat Kohli on Day 4, as India's old warhorse came to the party with his 28th Test hundred, ending India's wait of three years and three months to see Kohli register another three-figure mark in Test cricket. The century will become even more special if India go on to win the match and as a result qualify for the World Test Championship (WTC) final.

LIVE UPDATES: DAY 4

Kohli was 59 not out when he came back to resume his innings on Sunday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. By the time the players left the field for lunch, Kohli had added only 29 to his score in the session to be 88 not out.

It was uncharacteristic of Kohli, who usually approaches the game aggressively, but the master batter had gauged the situation after losing Ravindra Jadeja (28) early on the fourth morning, and the news on Shreyas Iyer was that he was taken for scans to get his back pain diagnosed.

Wicketkeeper KS Bharat came out to join Kohli in India's pursuit of taking lead and got busy right from the start to reach 25* at lunch.

But India, 362/4 at lunch on Sunday, were still behind by 118 runs.

Stand-in skipper Steve Smith's tactics dried up the boundaries for India and made run-making difficult, which meant that the Virat-Bharat duo had to buckle down and bide their time. But it was a tricky situation for them as India need to up the scoring rate to go into the lead quickly besides preserving wickets, with just a day left in the match after Sunday.

The urgency showed in Bharat's changed approach soon after the lunch break, as he hit Cameron Green for two consecutive sixes, followed by a four off a no-ball in the same over, to swing the momentum in India's favour. The over produced 21 runs, the most expensive of the series.

Kohli, meanwhile, dealt in singles to move into the 90s; but before he could get to his hundred, the former India captain lost partner Bharat, who was dismissed by Nathan Lyon for 44, caught by Peter Handscomb at short-leg. The fifth-wicket partnership produced 84 runs.

The injured Shreyas, however, still wasn't available and left-hander Axar Patel came out to join Kohli in the middle.

Kohli's patient Test century finally arrived off the 241st ball he faced. A whip to deep mid-wicket off Lyon for a single.

The fact that those 241 balls he faced included just five sent past the boundary ropes for fours reflects the picture of determination that Kohli painted during this special knock.

And this one will remain extra special for Kohli personally, as it took over three years since his 27th century in Test cricket. This is also his eighth hundred in Tests against Australia. Sachin Tendulkar (11) has scored most Test centuries by an Indian against Australia, followed by Sunil Gavaskar (8).

The four-match series currently stands 2-1 in favour of India, who will retain the Border-Gavaskar trophy by virtue of being the current holders. But the hosts are desperate for a win, as only that will earn them a spot in the WTC final against Australia.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket-keeper'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-ball', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'No-ball'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Handscomb', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Peter Handscomb'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Swing bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}]","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98579042,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-47534,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",eng-8469535,0.1137254901960785,416302380,1,timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Narendra Modi Stadium ICC World Test Championship Shubman Gill Ahmedabad Australia Ravindra Jadeja Boundary (cricket) Shreyas Iyer Wicket Batting (cricket) Wicket-keeper Captain (cricket) No-ball Sunil Gavaskar Nathan Lyon Border–Gavaskar Trophy Peter Handscomb Axar Patel Swing bowling Fielding (cricket) Sachin Tendulkar,India,IN,,,Center-right,ChatGPT,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,33,7,2023-03-12

This was the Indian superstar's 75th century across formats in international cricket.

India were 400 for five with Kohli batting on 100, in reply to Australia's first innings total of 480 all out.

Kohli went past 80 for the first time since his Test ton drought, with his previous highest score of 79 in South Africa in January 2022.

The star batsman reached his first Test half-century since January 2022 on the third day with his previous best being 44 in this series.

Shubman Gill led India's strong reply on Saturday with his 128 before he fell to Nathan Lyon's off-spin.

India need a win to clinch the series and be sure of a berth in the World Test Championship final in June.","[{'uri': 'agence_france_presse@khaleejtimes.com', 'name': 'Agence France-Presse', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Off spin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}}}]",https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=add08a45-7e42-5a1e-80f9-a4430e1558f4&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.56818&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.01515,eng-8469535,0.2705882352941176,416302380,1,khaleejtimes.com,news,Khaleej times,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia International cricket Innings Batting (cricket) ICC World Test Championship Off spin Shubman Gill South Africa,United-Arab-Emirates,AE,?,,Center,ChatGPT,C19,C9,Asia,AS,Muslim,44.0,50.0,146.0,38.0,78.0,32.0,22.0,22.0,26.0,47.0,33.0,42.0,119.0,74.0,36.0,52.0,66.0,22.0,22.0,?,?,?,?,Arab League,AL,Arabic-speaking,Ara,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,33,7,2023-03-12

Team India has not backed down from a fight with the bat, as it continues to bat strong on Day 4 of the fourth and final Test against Australia in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Meanwhile, besides young opener Shubman Gill (128), it was former Indian skipper Virat Kohli who also stole the show, striking his 28th Test hundred, while it was also his maiden Test century in over four years. Consequently, his supporters hailed him all over social media.

Kohli had to wait for 41 innings to get this ton, as it happens to be his longest wait for the same. Meanwhile, it was also his slowest ton against the Aussies, besides being his second slowest in his Test career. Meanwhile, Kohli is the third most Test hundred scorer among active Test cricketers, behind Steven Smith (30) and Joe Root (29).

Virat Kohli brought up his much-anticipated century against Australia in the ongoing Border Gavaskar series on Sunday. The three year (1204 days) wait finally came to an end as Kohli powered India closer to Australia's first innings score of 480. The former Indian captain had to labour his way to the three figure mark as he brought up his 28th Test century in 241 balls.

Milestone man

Kohli flicked Lyon for single to bring up his 75th international hundred. ""It was a different type of innings,"", Matthew Hayden said on air. Kohli had a strike rate of well below 50 as the Australian bowlers maintained tight lines but found it hard to find wickets. The milestone man scored his first boundary of the day only after bringing up his century which came after 164 balls.

Ravi Shastri on air credited Kohli for the fine knock, ""600kg Gorilla off his back. Quality knock this.""

In his 50th Test match at home, Virat Kohli became only the fifth Indian batter to surpass 4,000 runs in Test cricket in India. At the start of the Test, Kohli needed 42 runs to reach 4000 runs at home, and the former Test captain got there in the 87th over of the Indian innings. Kohli hit a boundary off Nathan Lyon to reach the milestone.

Earlier, Jadeja was the lone dismissal in the first session as Kohli anchored the innings. KS Bharat and Kohli stitched another 50 + run partnership to keep the Aussies at bay before the wicketkeeper departed after scoring 44 runs.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Matthew Hayden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Strike rate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket-keeper'}}]",https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2023-03/966a6da9-b1f7-4f44-807f-c2924e1c71cf/kohli.PNG?rect=0%2C0%2C3900%2C2194&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,eng-8469535,0.04313725490196085,416302620,1,freepressjournal.in,news,Free Press Journal,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia Captain (cricket) Australia national cricket team Matthew Hayden Strike rate Wicket Ravi Shastri Nathan Lyon Batting (cricket) Wicket-keeper,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,37,7,2023-03-12

Kohli also ended his Test ton drought, scoring his first hundred in whites since 2019.

The last hundred Kohli scored was against Bangladesh in the pink ball Test at Eden Gardens in November 2019.

Resuming his innings at 59 off 128 on Sunday, Kohli took his time to score the remaining 41 runs. Off 241 deliveries, he only scored five fours in a gritty knock in the first innings.

However, that was not before a moment of worry when wicketkeeper-batter KS Bharat turned down Kohli's call for a quick single in the 109th over. This almost led to Kohli losing his wicket, and the former India captain gave his teammate a stare-down and an angry word of advice.

Bharat took his spot at number six and faced 70 deliveries before lunch, hitting a four and a six. In doing so, he added 53 runs for the fifth wicket with Kohli. Their partnership was a slow burn, with Kohli contributing only four runs off 48 balls at one stage.

He was eventually dismissed for 44 by Nathan Lyon.

Kohli, meanwhile, continued playing his knock as India reduced the lead below 70.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Eden Gardens'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

""This is Virat Kohli the batter. Has the power and the tools, and knows when to use what. Well played,"" ex-India batter Wasim Jaffer captioned a meme on Twitter.

""Welcome back Virat Kohli. This is a test century well received in many quarters. No 28,"" West Indies great Ian Bishop tweeted.

""Well played @imVkohli this 28th test Century came after 41 innings,"" former India pacer Munaf Patel posted on Twitter.

While there was a slump in his form across formats since 2019, he had found a to way to get back among the runs in limited-overs cricket last year. He continues his run-scoring spree in white-ball cricket but couldn't get the big scores in Test cricket. Even in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Kohli had failed to get a significant score heading into the fourth Test match.

However, after having conceded 480 runs in the first innings when India needed their batting order to stand up, Kohli delivered an impressive performance. It was not one of those innings where he domianted right from the word go but he had to work hard for his runs and reached the three-figure mark off the 241st ball that he faced.

This was the former India captain's 28th Test match hundred and his 75th overall in international cricket. Following the batter getting to the hundred, social media has been flooded with all sorts of reactions on social media.

'600kg Gorilla off his back,' said Ravi Shastri on air after Virat Kohli notched up his 28 Test hundred on Saturday in Ahmedabad. The former Indian captain ended the drought of tons in the longest format of the game with a single off Nathan Lyon's delivery on the fourth day of the final Test against Australia. Shastri was the head coach of the Indian cricket team when Virat Kohli scored his 27 century in Test cricket, against Bangladesh in 2019. Since then, it took him 41 innings to bring up the 28th.

Virat walked out to bat on 88 after the lunch break on day 4 of the Ahmedabad Test. Once he was on, the spectators at the Narendra Modi stadium were on the edge of their seats as they gathered in large numbers just to see a Virat Kohli hundred. Nathan Lyon bowled a fuller delivery and Kohli clipped it towards deep square leg and took a single. 100 runs against his name and the crowd were ecstatic.

The silent celebration

Kohli's celebration, which is usually full of energy and includes some air punching, was totally different this time. He was calmer than ever, removed his helmet and kissed the ring he wears in the chain while batting. He raised his bat and on other hand, his teammates gave him a standing ovation as the moment was so special. The wait was finally over and a Test century was at Kohli's disposal.

Another century, another record

With his 28 Test ton, Virat Kohli set another batting record for India in the longest format of the game. It was his 8 hundred against Australia which helped him equalled the long-standing record of Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar.

The hosts managed just 73 runs in 32 overs of the morning session after losing overnight batter Ravindra Jadeja for 28.

India lost the sole wicket of Jadeja early in the day after he suddenly switched his approach from a sensible, classic Test innings to one where he went after Todd Murphy's spin. However, one boundary in and he lost his wicket in the process, holing out to Usman Khawaja at mid-on.

The change in approach from Jadeja, or his lack of patience, came as a bit of surprise as India still had a big deficit to clear and with concerns around Shreyas Iyer's fitness and perhaps, availability. Harsha Bhogle on commentary confirmed, that Iyer complained of back pain and had gone for scans.

Kohli, who awaits his first Test century since November 2019, remained unbeaten on 88 after he went about cautiously on the Ahmedabad pitch. Kohli went past 80 for the first time since his Test ton drought, with his previous highest score of 79 in South Africa in January 2022.

At lunch, India finished at 362/4 with Kohli twelve runs away from a long-awaited century. After Jadeja's dismissal, the batter combined with wicket-keeper batter KS Bharat (25*) to stitch an unbeaten 53-run partnership.

And how the absence of first-class cricket can tear a hole in the fabric of an uber-confident batsman. There he was popping up across India or recently in Bangladesh in Tests, trying to find a method that works for him against spin. Without the luxury of domestic games, he was learning on the go, so to speak.

It all came together on a pleasant afternoon in Ahmedabad, with a strong crowd chanting his name and egging him on. The most noticeable aspect of his hundred wasn't the manner he compiled the runs, but the muted celebration. The absence of adrenalin was stark. He could have been heading towards a drinks break or so it seemed: a gentle jog to complete the run, a gently raised arm holding the bat, the slow removal of the helmet. The hands reached inside his shirt to pull out his wedding ring, dangling on a necklace, a kiss was planted, and the acknowledgement of the crowd.

Three-and-half years of barrenness, three-and-half years of slowly swelling criticism, the losing of the captaincy crown, the headlines that screamed 'King Kohli dethroned', a mental struggle to accept the loss of his stature, a brief apathy towards the game, a falling out of love for the game even, but the tide turned with acceptance of his state. The sense of victimhood began to fade out from his head, the heart opened up for love to rush in, and also, a sense of calmness. As if someone took out the old Kohli toy, rewired the synapsis a bit, and a man more assured of his self, his stature who was friendlier with the opposition came out. The fangs withdrew, replaced with smiles. It took a while to get used to, but the runs began to come. First in the white-ball cricket, and now, finally, in whites.

But the three-year agony is worth exploring how sport can tease and test a batsman as good as Kohli, who seemed to be grappling with doubts about his game.

Something as basic, and vital, as which-stump stance to take against the spinners, for example. It was perplexingly fascinating. Would a batsman of such stature be tinkering with a stance - not as an act of assurance of success but as an experiment to check if this helps him cope better? And so, Kohli took the middle-stump guard against the Sri Lanka in one Test early last year; didn't work. He tried a leg-stump stance in the next Test; didn't work. In Bangladesh, he started with the leg-stump in the first Test at Chattogram, before moving to middle in the next; not much success.

The ball at Chattogram turf landed on the leg and middle. Kohli went back to try to turn the ball to the leg side, but bat-face totally shut, and the ball turned past the bat to ping his back pad in front of the middle stump. In the second, from a middle-stump, he lunged well forward but couldn't get his bat ahead in time to properly manoeuvre the ball and edged it.

He doesn't use his feet to skip forward against spin and one time he tried against Todd Murphy this series, he fell to a stumping for the first time in his career.

Kohli's game against spin is nothing like the masters of the previous generations. Or even the best in the business currently. Domination isn't his forte. No lavish indulgence but a more upper middle-class approach: tapping the ball into gaps, punching off back foot, steering off the front, the nurdles, the taps, the whips and the occasional Sunday-feast out with an expansive scythe through cover point to a full delivery with width outside off.

In recent times, though, a hint of poverty has peeped in. Survival has been a concern. Troubles on stretched front foot, with both edges and lbw under threat and when pressing back, the top-hand would fade out and bottom hand would take over to turn the bat into awkward angles.

Prosperity began to return in this series against Australians. The runs don't show it - and it is indeed the marker that counts - but Kohli has found the method.

He has opened up in his stance and shortened the forward lunge. He is back on a middle-stump guard, but now by opening up he isn't as wary of the lbw as he was. It was that concern that perhaps made him retreat to the leg stump in the recent past, taking care not to press his front leg across and in the way of the turning ball. But what it did to him was to make him play more across. The body is always going across from that point on and the off-break turning in has a more venomous potential for lbw, especially for someone with Kohli's style of batting. And when you lunge across from there, the bottom-hand too can tighten a bit more than is ideal. And as Sunil Gavaskar said on these pages, without the top hand guiding the direction of the bat, it can and will turn at awkward angles to create even more problems.

And his method this series - opening-up his stance allied with middle-stump guard, has also reflected in his wagon wheel of runs. Most of his runs and even the gentle taps for dot balls have been to the leg side to the spinners. Even in this century knock (at the point when he reached his hundred) only 17 runs came on the off side to the spinners; 58 runs were on the leg side.

He has also been noticeably much more compact with this method. Ironically, it was only on the flattest track at Ahmedabad, was he in a bit of bother for 20 minutes at the start. On the rank turners, he has looked very composed until the ball that has consumed him, of course.

Nathan Lyon tried round the stumps line - the one turning in from a good length on middle stump line towards middle to see if the bat is dangled across and a lbw pops up. No luck, as Kohli had plenty of wood behind the leather. Lyon slipped in the straighter one with the angle, but Kohli's hands adjusted well to nudge them away. When Todd Murphy tired of trying the same ploy and floated a couple well outside off, Kohli slashed them through cover point. Matt Kuhnemann tried his close-to-the-stumps attack on the stumps but without any turn, Kohli was unfussed.

And so, Lyon went over the stumps, trying to poke an error on the forward defensive. But time and again, Kohli stretched forward but no long a stride that his bat gets caught behind the pad; instead with what also seemed a wider stance than usual, his forward strides were more precise and the hands and the bat could come ahead. More Sachin Tendulkar than Dravid, in terms of the forward stride.

The hundred number 75 has been ticked off, and though Tendulkar's 100 is a distant speck, the good thing is Kohli the batsman who has re-fallen in love with the game and who seems to have discovered another hidden layer to his batting has propped up. The Dark Knight has risen, a touch older, slower, but wiser.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladesh'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladesh'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Leg before wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'First-class cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Helmet'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Textile'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chittagong'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Chittagong'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladesh'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_side', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Leg side'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythe', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Scythe'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumped', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Stumped'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Limited overs cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Middle class'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'White people'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_and_length', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Line and length'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Lyon'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Lyon'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'France'}}}}]",https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/Virat-Kohli-Kohli-India-vs-Australia-IND-vs-AUS.jpg,eng-8469535,0.2078431372549019,416305080,1,indianexpress.com,news,The Indian Express,Spin bowling Virat Kohli Cricket bat Batting (cricket) Test cricket India Bangladesh Leg before wicket Stump (cricket) First-class cricket Captain (cricket) Helmet Textile Ahmedabad Chittagong Leg side Scythe Stumped Fielding (cricket) Limited overs cricket Middle class Cricket White people Sri Lanka Line and length Sunil Gavaskar Nathan Lyon Australia national cricket team Sachin Tendulkar Lyon,India,IN,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,18,8,2023-03-12

The star batsman's knock also came to end a prolonged drought as Kohli failed to get three figures in Test since 2019.

On the day fourth Test between India and Australia in the Border Gavaskar trophy, Blues star batter Virat Kohli followed suit with Shubman Gill and knocked a century in Gujarat's Ahmedabad stadium. Kohli's century made him tie with Sunil Gavaskar's with 8th century in becoming the most Test century scored by an Indian against Australia.

Kohli can now hope to achieve Indian cricket legend, Sachin Tendulkar. The star batsman's knock also came to end a prolonged drought as Kohli failed to get three figures in Test since 2019. At the moment, Kohli continues to bat at 119 with Axar Patel's partnership.

Virat Kohli's performance comes a day after Shubman gill registered his 2nd century in a test format against the Aussies on Day 3 of the fourth Test. After Gill delivered an inspiring performance, Kohli followed suit on day 4 with his stellar performance.

The Indian team continues to trail against the Aussies by 36 runs.

Following Virat Kohli's stellar knock ending his Century drought of over 3 years, many fans took to Twitter to laud the performance of the Blues' star batsman.

One user shared an image of Virat Kohli celebrating his century as the picture showed Steve Smith appreciating the Indian Batsman's knock. One user also shared the fans bowing to Virat Kohli after his innings and termed the Indian batsman as king.

One user also wrote and discerningly highlighted a pattern where they wrote how Virat Kohli visited Kainchi Dham before his 73rd Century and then subsequently Vrindavan before 74th Century and then Mahakaleshwar before his 75th Century. The user further wrote that by the time Kohli reaches his 100th century, he will probably have visited more temples than the user's parents.

One user also wrote and said that Kohli inspires every generation and called Kohli to be the last of his kind, implying how the star batsman talent garners a lot of praise from the younger generation, as well as the older one.","[{'uri': 'apn_live@apnlive.com', 'name': 'Apn Live', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Gujarat'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Gujarat'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Smith (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}]",https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/apnlive/uploads/2023/03/12134656/Screenshot-2023-03-12-134607.png,eng-8469535,0.02745098039215677,416305500,1,apnlive.com,news,APN Live,Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) Test cricket India Sachin Tendulkar Cricket Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019 Sunil Gavaskar Australia national cricket team Shubman Gill Ahmedabad Gujarat Cricket bat India national cricket team Steve Smith (cricketer) Innings Twitter,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,25,8,2023-03-12

Watch | Cricket News","India's superstar cricketer Virat Kohli hit his first Test century since November 2019, ending his long drought on day four of the fourth Test against Australia on Sunday. ""King Kohli"" reached his 28th Test hundred off 241 balls with a single off Nathan Lyon, sparking wild celebrations at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. Appearing to tear up, he acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room before kissing the locket on his gold chain as he smiled and looked up to the sky.

Former India head coach Ravi Shastri screamed on commentary, ""a 600-kilo gorilla is off his back. He will grow a couple of inches taller by this evening"".

A placard in the crowd read ""Here to see King Kohli ruling in his kingdom"" as children in India shirts bowed in respect.

Even the Australian players acknowledged Kohli as they were seen clapping after Kohli reached triple figures.

The star batsman resumed on his overnight score of 59 after he got his first Test half-century since January 2022 on day three on a pitch favouring the batsmen.

Kohli, 34, went through an extended lean patch last year, failing to reach three figures in more than 1,000 days.

He quit as T20I skipper in late 2021 and in January 2022 was sacked from the one-day captaincy and gave up leading the Test side, too.

But he hit his first ton after 1,020 days in the Asia Cup T20 tournament in September last year and hasn't looked back since.

Kohli finished the T20 World Cup in Australia as the leading run-scorer and then hit three ODI centuries, including two -- 113 and 166 not out -- against Sri Lanka in January.

The former captain has a Test average of more than 48 in 108 matches since making his debut in 2011 and has struck 75 centuries across the three international formats.

Kohli remains behind Australia stand-in-skipper Steve Smith and England's Joe Root in the number of Test centuries between the ""fabulous four"" -- the leading four batsmen of the modern era.

Smith overtook Kohli during the Indian batsman's lean phase and now has 30 Test centuries since his previous 95th Test. Root has 29.

Virat Kohli scored a Test century after an agonising three year wait. The former Indian captain brought up his 28th Test century after 1204 days. Kohli has replicated a special feat accomplished by the legendary Sunil Gavaskar 40 years ago with this knock. Gavaskar scored a century while batting at No. 4 in his 50th Test at home in 1983.

Kohli also brought upon his eighth Test century against Australia, taking him level with Gavaskar for the joint most tons by an Indian player against Australia, trailing only Sachin Tendulkar with 11 centuries.

Kohli got off to a good start, but then hit a roadblock and laboured his way to the three figure mark. IKohli didn't hit a single boundary in the first two sessions before hitting two in three balls in the third.

In his 50th Test match at home, Virat Kohli became only the fifth Indian batter to surpass 4,000 runs in Test cricket in India.

Kohli brought up Test century No.28 after flicking Nathan Lyon for a single and helping India push towards a crucial first-innings lead.

There was a gap of 41 innings between his last century and this one, with the previous one coming over three years ago against Bangladesh in November 2019.

Kohli scored a sublime 136 in India's only innings at the Eden Gardens and helped his team secure an innings and 46-run victory.

""600kg Gorilla off his back,"" Ravi Shastri boomed on commentary as Kohli raised his bat, then removed his helmet with a smile and kissed his necklace in relief to a standing ovation from the Ahmedabad crowd.

He now has eight Test hundreds against Australia, second-most, on par with Sunil Gavaskar on a list that is topped by Sachin Tendulkar, who has 11.

His 28th Test ton is also his 75th international hundred.

Former India skipper brought up his much-needed hundred in 241 balls. It was the most-awaited ton as his last century came against Bangladesh in November 2019. With this century, he took his international century tally to 75. Kohli's hundred has chipped off a chunk of Australia's lead as India look to press home the advantage.

After Gill's century, Virat Kohli also played a crucial role in India's dominating run as he started batting from where he left off on day 3. He went on to get a century, ending his drought. The last time Kohli scored a century in whites was way back in 2019.

During the initial session on day 4, India lost Ravindra Jadeja. Wicketkeeper Bharat came in to bat with Kohli. Since Shreyas Iyer complained of back pain, Bharat was promoted up the order. Meanwhile, in the 109th over of the game, the former India skipper was batting and wanted to take a single but then the Andhra-based player turned down his request and as a result, he had to face Kohli's death stare. Virat then screamed at him because it almost led to Kohli losing his wicket.

Bharat then took his place and played a good knock of 44 runs before getting out off Nathan Lyon. The former India captain crossed three figures mark in Test cricket after over 1200 days and notched up his 28th Test hundred. Kohli reached the landmark on the 241st ball he faced in his innings and then celebrated calmly by kissing his wedding ring.

Earlier, heroics from Usman Khawaja and Cameron Green helped Australia post a massive 480 runs in the first innings.

This is Kohli's first Test century in 1205 days.

After a wait of three years and four months, Virat Kohli has finally scored his 28th Test century in the ongoing fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, putting an end to his unusually long wait for a three-figure score in red-ball cricket. Kohli had last scored a Test century in November 2019, and this knock will be one that he will remember for a long time. Kohli had broken his century-less streak in international cricket last year with a hundred each in T20Is and ODIs, and then added a 74th earlier this year against Sri Lanka in an ODI.

This is Kohli's first Test century in 1205 days. Kohli has emulated a remarkable feat accomplished by Sunil Gavaskar 40 years ago as both players celebrated their 50th Test at home with a century, batting at No. 4. As Gavaskar was celebrating his 14th century at home, Kohli is now celebrating his 13th. This is Kohli's eighth Test century against Australia, equaling Gavaskar's record for the joint second-most tons by an Indian player against Australia, trailing only the famous Sachin Tendulkar.

Kohli started the morning session well but then slowed down. It's worth mentioning that Kohli hit his first boundary of the day seven balls before the session ended. Kohli was a little nervous on the best batting pitch of the series, but he quickly recovered. He was squared up by a twisting ball from Matthew Kuhnemann on Day 3 and overcame a number of LBW shouts with the impact plainly being outside off on Day 4.

By lunch, Kohli was still undefeated on 88, scoring at a strike rate of 40, which is not normally associated with Kohli, but the situation of the game dictated his strategy. Kohli was content to bide his time as India plundered 73 runs from 32 overs, losing only one wicket - Ravindra Jadeja. Following lunch, though, the tempo of the innings quickened, and KS Bharat switched gears, smashing Cameron Green for six, six, and four runs in a 21-run over, the most expensive of the series. This meant that Kohli had to be content with singles to get through the 90s.

India's fifth wicket fell when KS Bharat inside-edged the ball onto his pads, sending it airborne for Peter Handscomb to easily catch at forward short leg, with Kohli just two runs away from his century. However, Kohli was not deterred by the dismissal and calmly scored a couple of singles in the following two overs to reach his 75th international century. Kohli celebrated the milestone by lifting his bat, removing his helmet, and kissing his wedding ring.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2016', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'First-class cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Leg before wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

Embracing a lean patch in the second edition of the ICC World Test Championship, Kohli had struggled to score a single half-century in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy prior to the 4th Test against Australia. Regaining top form in the series decider, Kohli smashed his first half-century of the 2023 season on Saturday.

Extending his patient innings on Day 4 of the 4th Test match, the former skipper converted his fabulous knock to triple-digit figures prior to the end of the second session. Ending his 1205-day wait for a century in the longest and oldest format of the game, Kohli slammed his 28th Test ton at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. Celebrating the monumental feat, Kohli dedicated his special knock to his lady love Anushka Sharma during the 4th Test match against Steve Smith's men.

Nicknamed King Kohli, the former India skipper completed his 28th Test hundred off 241 balls by taking a single during one of Nathan Lyon's overs. ""A 600-kilo gorilla is off his back. He will grow a couple of inches taller by this evening,"" reckoned Ravi Shastri as the former Indian head coach lauded the batting icon during match commentatory on Star Sports. From former Indian opener Wasim Jaffer to legendary batter Virender Sehwag, several icons of the game lauded Kohli after the star batter slammed his 28th Test century.

Kohli had resumed his knock after smashing 59 runs on Day 3 of the 4th Test match between India and Australia at Ahmedabad. Regarded as one of the greatest batters across all formats, Kohli scored 27 Test centuries in 141 innings. However, the 34-year-old took 42 innings to notch up his century No.28 in Test cricket. Batting maestro Kohli has 75 international centuries for Team India.

Prior to his batting masterclass against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy decider, Kohli's last century arrived against Bangladesh in 2019. Earlier, Kohli had slammed his first century after 1,020 days at the Asia Cup last year. The Indian run-machine had also finished as the leading run-getter at the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. Kohli had registered three centuries in One Day Internationals (ODIs), including his sublime knocks of 113 and 166* against Sri Lanka in January.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2016', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasim_Jaffer', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wasim Jaffer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virender_Sehwag', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Virender Sehwag'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Star Sports (Indian TV network)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': ""2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/12/1600x900/Collage_Maker-12-Mar-2023-02-14-PM-8258_1678610737558_1678610754381_1678610754381.jpg,eng-8469535,0.0980392156862746,416307000,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Border–Gavaskar Trophy Virat Kohli Captain (cricket) Test cricket India Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016 Narendra Modi Stadium ICC World Test Championship Innings Batting (cricket) Ravi Shastri Over (cricket) Cricket Ahmedabad Wasim Jaffer Virender Sehwag Asia Cup Star Sports (Indian TV network) Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020–21 India national cricket team One Day International Australia,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,50,8,2023-03-12

Kohli was unbeaten on 135 (291 balls; 10x4) alongside Axar Patel (38 not out; 75 balls, 3x4, 1x6). At the break, India trailed Australia by just eight runs.

Virat Kohli sedately inched towards his first Test hundred since November 2019 as India reached 362 for four at lunch on day four of the fourth Test against Australia here on Sunday.

The pitch hasn't been easy for scoring with only 73 runs scored off 32 overs in the morning session. Kohli (88 batting) added 29 runs to his overnight score of 59 not out with India still 118 runs behind Australia's first innings score of 480.

With Shreyas Iyer unlikely to bat due to recurrence of a lower back injury, K.S. Bharat was promoted up the order and he did his case no harm with an unbeaten 25 off 70 balls.

The wicket-keeper also shared an unbroken 53-run stand with the former India captain.

Bharat, in fact, played the best shot of the morning, a slog sweep over cow corner off Nathan Lyon for a six.

The only wicket that India lost during the session was of Ravindra Jadeja (28 off 84 balls), who failed to clear Usman Khawaja at mid-on off Todd Murphy (2/64 in 32 overs).

Kohli has put his head down during his 220-ball knock and it did allow the Australians to control the proceedings on a slow deck. The only time he got closest to hitting a boundary was a flick through mid-wicket off Cameron Green but Mitchell Starc cut it down to three runs.

He was then happy getting the occasional single and double to keep the scoreboard moving.

Bharat, who has had a wretched time with the bat in the series so far, did look way more confident on a flat track and was more assured in his defence.

He put a big stride forward to negate the little bit of turn that was on offer for the Australian spinners.

The only one who got a couple of deliveries to break back sharply was Lyon (1/99 in 49 overs).

Appearing to tear up, he acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room before kissing the locket on his gold chain as he smiled and looked up to the sky.

Commentator Ravi Shastri screamed, ""a 600-kilo gorilla is off his back. He will grow a couple of inches taller by this evening"".

A placard in the crowd read ""Here to see King Kohli ruling in his kingdom"" as children in India shirts bowed in respect.

The star batsman resumed on his overnight score of 59 after he got his first Test half-century since January 2022 on day three on a pitch favouring the batsmen.

Kohli, 34, went through an extended lean patch last year, failing to reach three figures in more than 1,000 days.

He quit as a Twenty20 skipper in late 2021 and in January 2022 was sacked from the one-day captaincy and gave up leading the Test side, too.

But he hit his first ton after 1,020 days in the Asia Cup T20 tournament in September last year and hasn't looked back since.

Kohli finished the T20 World Cup in Australia as the leading run-scorer and then hit three ODI centuries, including two -- 113 and 166 not out -- against Sri Lanka in January.

The former captain has a Test average of more than 48 in 108 matches since making his debut in 2011 and has struck 75 centuries across the three international formats.

Kohli remains behind Australia stand-in-skipper Steve Smith and England's Joe Root in the number of Test centuries between the ""fabulous four"" -- the leading four batsmen of the modern era.

Kohli's 28th Test century came at a time when India was following a massive score in a crucial match.

Indian cricket fans waited for around 41 innings to witness another century from the star. Kohli's last Test century was in November 2019 against Bangladesh.

""600kg Gorilla off his back,"" Ravi Shastri boomed on commentary as Kohli completed that single against Nathan Lyon and raised his bat. Kohli removed his helmet, smiled, and kissed his necklace in relief at the standing ovation from the crowd in the stadium.

This century takes his total number of international 100s to 75 and Kohli has also touched the number of Sunil Gavaskar, when it comes to centuries against Australia. Both players are now second with 8 Test centuries against the Kangaroos, in a list topped by Sachin Tendulkar with 11 centuries.

Kohli is coming out of a relatively tough phase which even cost him the Indian captaincy. He was facing poor forms across all formats and it was Asia Cup 2022 when things started changing for the star player. After that, he displayed nothing but excellence across all formats and this Test century will be really special to him.

Yesterday, a similar sort of magic was displayed by young Shubman Gill who gave a tough time to Australian players and scored 128 runs. It was a responsible partnership of over 100 runs between Gill and Pujara which helped India to stand strong against a whopping 480 runs made by Australians during their first innings.

The fourth Test match has been different as the batters are getting the opportunity to score more runs.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}]",https://images.livemint.com/img/2023/03/12/600x338/PTI03-12-2023-000135B-0_1678611900541_1678611900541_1678611916889_1678611916889.jpg,eng-8469535,0.09019607843137245,416308380,1,livemint.com,news,mint,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia Narendra Modi Stadium Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Cricket Ahmedabad Sunil Gavaskar Ravi Shastri Nathan Lyon Century (cricket) Innings Cricket bat Asia Cup Australia national cricket team Sachin Tendulkar Shubman Gill Captain (cricket),India,IN,English,eng,fiscally-conservative-socially-liberal,https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiMint_(newspaper),C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,13,9,2023-03-12

Kohli scored a sublime 136 in India's only innings at the Eden Gardens and helped his team secure an innings and 46-run victory.

Virat Kohli quickly unclips the helmet and gently raises it with the bat in his right hand. No exaggeration, no fist pumps in the air, no wide extension of the arms. Just a gentle raise to acknowledge the dressing room for a very brief moment. In a split second, the batting gear was on the ground, the gloves were removed as he reached out for his wedding ring, which he wears on a chain around his neck. The eyes were shut and sweat off the forehead trickled down to the eyebrows as he planted a firm kiss on the ring.

He had a weary smile that never left his lips even when the ring was neatly placed beneath the Indian jersey. The home dugout was up on their feet and the opposition camp in the middle, led by Nathan Lyon, generously applauded as the 34-year-old continued to soak it all in. Sunday wasn't about the technicalities of batting, how he scored the runs, who he scored them against and where they stood in the context of the game. That single in the 139th over, which gave Kohli the 100th run of his innings was a moment the entire country had eagerly waited for 1205 days.

It meant a lot. Not only to the man who had done it 74 times in international cricket but also to the spectators who had braved the sun to see India's favourite son. No one wanted to rest in the shade when the great man was just a single away from the three-figure mark. They rushed, converged to the metal railings guarding the ground and had the smartphones out to capture the footage for their potentially viral Instagram reels.

With Kohli, the expectations never end because of the high standards he has set for himself and the followers of the game. When the ton-drought ended with the 122* in the T20I against Afghanistan, expectations moved to ODIs. When he scored three in a little over a month, the focus moved to Tests. And the noise kept getting louder since the Bangladesh series and the ongoing home series vs Australia.

In every sense, the comeback is well and truly complete as the right-hander has put doubts to rest in T20Is, ODIs and Tests. All this in little over six months. Again, how he scored, and where he scored is not the talking point here. Kohli is.

A player who has carried the weight of billion hopes first as a player then as captain and now again as a player deserves this moment under the sun. The moment when he can afford a deep breath and a sigh of relief. He will go on to score more runs and tons in his already illustrious career but this would have meant the world to him.

The celebration wasn't the wild one but it certainly gives a sneak peek into the man he is now. He is no longer the West Delhi brat who has ""Ben Stokes"" (pun intended) on his lips, but a polished gentleman living in Mumbai and keeping a close check on the weight of his body and the food on his plate. The barren run without the ton did bring a different Kohli to the world.

Over the last few months, Kohli, the into-your-face character, has transformed into that cool figure who wouldn't mind sharing a laugh or two with the opposition camp and uncharacteristically engages in long friendly conversations in the middle. Clearly found a buddy in Nathan Lyon in this series.

There are numerous clips, now transformed into catchy reels, of Kohli's fiery days dominating Instagram timelines but off late the composed talk, the mature podcasts and the visits to seek divine blessings have outnumbered them.

On the eve of this ton, a sedate Kohli reel popped up during some late-night navigation and his words, at a BCCI awards function in 2017, made so much sense in the current scenario.

""I always wanted to be one of the top players in the world. For sure! So I understood what it would take me to maintain my form in all three formats, not just one format. Along my early days in my career, there have been people who have doubted the way I have gone about my game. Even now, there are doubters and haters all around,"" Kohli said while speaking to former India cricketer Farokh Engineer at the event which also had former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi in attendance.

""One thing is for sure that I have always believed in myself. I have always believed in my heart that If I work hard 120% every day in my life, I am answerable to no one. And I think if I get an opportunity, I am going to win games for my country. And I try to do that every time I go out to bat,"" the star batter added.

Seeing him bat over the last few months, there's been no dearth of self-belief or the 120% work he had mentioned. The 34-year-old has been the first to hit the nets during the Border Gavaskar Trophy and has trained hard every day to get, as former India coach Ravi Shastri mentioned during commentary in a booming voice, ""600kg gorilla off his back"".

Can visualise the 34-year-old taking the long staircase to the dressing room during the Tea interval and just sitting and reflecting on what he achieved after toiling hard under the sun for 1205 days. He wasn't woefully out of form but just short on runs. Now that they have started to flow, Kohli would hope to maintain a steady stream and keep the slope slippery for the ""600kg gorilla"".",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli',

At the time of Tea, India's score read 472/5 with Kohli (135)* and Axar Patel (38)* unbeaten at the crease. The hosts still trail by just 8 runs.

Kohli ended his Test century drought as he slammed his first Test century since November 2019.

After Lunch, Indian batters Virat Kohli and Srikar Bharat opened their hands and slammed Australian bowlers at regular intervals for boundaries.

Cameron Green was on the receiving end with Bharat smashing him for 21 runs with the help of two boundaries and two sixes in an over.

Bharat's blistering stint at the crease came to an end as he was dismissed by Nathan Lyon for 44. The left-handed batter Axar Patel then came out to bat at the crease.

Kohli ended his Test century drought as he slammed his first Test century since November 2019. The former India captain brought up his much-needed hundred in 241 balls. It was the most-awaited ton as his last century came against Bangladesh in November 2019. With this century, he took his international century tally to 75.

Kohli continued his blistering form and slammed Mitchell Starc for brilliant two boundaries collecting 9 runs. Kohli along with Patel took India's total beyond the 400-run mark in the 140 overs of the game.

The duo of Kohli and Patel stitched up their 50-run partnership stand --the 6th consecutive 50-run partnership for Team India.

The Indian pair remained unbeaten as the visitors ended the session at 472/5.

Earlier, Kohli and Srikar Bharat showed remarkable skill and determination to frustrate the Australian bowling attack in the opening session of Day 4.

The batting pair of Ravindra Jadeja and Virat Kohli were decisive in their approach and made the Australian bowlers toil hard making merry of the excellent batting conditions on offer.

Australia skipper Steve Smith introduced Cameron Green into the attack in the very first over of day 4 and the bowler concede just 4 runs. Australia started with spin with Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy bowling in tandem from both ends.

The duo of Jadeja and Kohli took India's total beyond the 300-run mark in the 102nd over of the game. However, the 64-run partnership stand was broken by Murphy who dismissed Jadeja for 28 runs. Srikar Bharat then came out to bat.

The Indian batters rotated the strike brilliantly, not allowing the Australian bowlers to settle down while whacking the loose balls on offer.

Kohli and Bharat both were aggressors of the batting pair, smashing boundaries regularly. The duo stitched a solid 50-run partnership for Team India.

The Indian pair took India's score beyond the 350-run mark as the first session ended.

LIVE UPDATES: DAY 4

Kohli was looking good to go big after his century as he was undefeated on 135 at tea, with all-rounder Axar Patel reaching a confident 38 not out.

For the 15,000 odd people present at Motera, it was a Sunday to remember as Kohli guided Nathan Lyon towards mid-wicket to complete his first Test hundred since November 2019. The hundred, his 75th in international cricket, came off 241 balls.

India are now eight runs behind Australia's first innings score of 480.

Kohli's 291-ball innings picked up pace after he reached the milestone. In the first session, Kohli didn't hit a single boundary.

He also got a lot of support at the other end while adding 84 for the fifth wicket with Kona Bharat (44 off 88 balls) and another 63 with in-form Axar. The left-arm spinner has now compiled more than 200 runs in this series.

All partnerships for the first six wickets was worth more than 50 runs.

After scoring 73 runs in the morning, India upped the tempo in the post lunch session.

Bharat, who has had a dreadful run with the bat, looked impressive as he pulled and hooked Cameron Green for a couple of sixes when he tried bouncing the batter from around the wicket.

He was out to a bat-pad catch at short-leg off Nathan Lyon's bowling and missed out on what could have been a confidence boosting half-century.

But once Bharat was out, Kohli hit a flurry of boundaries and also had Axar going after the bowling.

The pitch hasn't been easy for scoring with only 73 runs scored off 32 overs in the morning session.

Bharat, in fact, played the best shot of the morning, a slog sweep over cow corner off Nathan Lyon for a six.

The only wicket that India lost during the session was of Ravindra Jadeja (28 off 84 balls), who failed to clear Usman Khawaja at mid-on off Todd Murphy (2/86 in 38 overs).

Kohli has put his head down during his knock and it did allow the Australians to control the proceedings on a slow deck. The only time he got closest to hitting a boundary was a flick through mid-wicket off Cameron Green but Mitchell Starc cut it down to three runs.

He was then happy getting the occasional single and double to keep the scoreboard moving.

Bharat did look way more confident on a flat track and was more assured in his defence.

He put a big stride forward to negate the little bit of turn that was on offer for the Australian spinners.

The only one who got a couple of deliveries to break back sharply was Lyon (2/124 in 58 overs).

Shubaman Gill stole the limelight on the Day 3 of the fourth Test match between India and Australia being played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Gill scored his second century in Test matches and also his first in India. Other than this former India skipper Virat Kohli also hit a half-century in Test matches after almost 14 months.

Apart from the half-century, Virat Kohli also achieved many milestones while batting on Day 3 of the fourth Test match. Virat became the third fastest Indian to make 4000 Test runs in India and achieved the mark in 77 innings. India batting legend Sachin Tendulkar tops the list with 7216 in 94 Tests.

Virat Kohli also broke West Indies legend Brian Lara's record and became the second-highest run scorer in international cricket vs Australia. The 34-year-old has scored 4729 runs at an average of 50.84 over 89 games and 104 innings. He has scored 15 centuries and 24 fifties against the Aussies, with the best individual score of 169. Lara, on the other hand, had scored 4714 runs against Australia in 82 matches and 108 innings, including 12 centuries and 26 half-centuries. He scored 277 against them, which he did at the SCG in a 1993 Test match that ended in a draw.

If we talk about the fourth Test match between India and Australia, Team India is well in control of the match as they have already scored 362/4 at Lunch on Day 4 and are inching close to Australia's first innings score of 480.

Before this Australia won the toss and elected to bat first on a batting-friendly Ahmedabad pitch and put up a score of 480 in their first innings courtesy of hundreds from Usman Khawaja and Cameron Green.

Usman Khawaja hit a 422 ball 180 and didn't face any difficulty facing the Indian bowlers. Cameron Green also notched his first Test century and played a 114-run knock off 170 balls. Khawaja and Green also stitched a 208-run partnership which was the highest in the four-match series so far.

Talking about the series, Team India is already 2-1 up in the four-match series and has retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Australia on the other hand have already qualified for the World Test Championship final whereas the hosts need to win the fourth Test to qualify for the final of the most anticipated event.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lara', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Brian Lara'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'West Indies cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Cricket_Ground', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney Cricket Ground'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Toss (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/sixehmnviszsivh9_1678612021.jpeg,eng-8469535,0.06666666666666665,416309700,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia Brian Lara Batting (cricket) Narendra Modi Stadium Captain (cricket) Ahmedabad Usman Khawaja International cricket West Indies cricket team Century (cricket) Sydney Cricket Ground Sachin Tendulkar Border–Gavaskar Trophy ICC World Test Championship Cricket pitch Cricket bat Toss (cricket) India national cricket team,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,35,9,2023-03-12

""King Kohli"", one of cricket's biggest names, admitted last year to mental health struggles as his magic with the bat deserted him. He also lost the Indian captaincy, one of the most high-pressure jobs in world sport.

But on Sunday, having already returned to form with ODI and T20 centuries in recent months, the long wait for his 28th Test ton ended in the fourth Test against Australia.

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Saturday since January 2022, the landmark came after a patient innings of 241 balls as he eased Nathan Lyon for a single.

Appearing to tear up, the heavily tattooed 34-year-old acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room before kissing the locket on his gold chain as he smiled and looked up to the sky.

""A 600-kilo gorilla is off his back. He will grow a couple of inches taller by this evening,"" shouted commentator and former India coach Ravi Shastri.

Australia's stand-in-skipper Steve Smith applauded on the ground, and a placard in the crowd read ""Here to see King Kohli ruling in his kingdom"", as children in India shirts bowed in respect.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted: ""Good to see @imVkohli back scoring a Test ton ... Love watching him Bat ... Over three years since his last one .. My guess is a few might come along now"".

Kohli had a tough 2021 and 2022, failing to reach three figures in over 1,000 days.

He quit as Twenty20 skipper in late 2021 and in January 2022 was sacked from the one-day captaincy and gave up leading the Test side too.

But he hit his first ton after 1,020 days in the Asia Cup T20 tournament in September last year and hasn't looked back since.

Kohli finished the T20 World Cup in Australia last year as the leading run-scorer and then hit three ODI centuries including two -- 113 and 166 not out -- against Sri Lanka in January.

Kohli is one of the best batsmen of his generation in world cricket. But the brash celebrity, who has 54 million Twitter followers and ubiquitously graces advertising campaigns, has had his share of run-ins with umpires and opponents alike along the way.

The former captain has a Test average of over 48 in 108 matches since making his debut in 2011 and has struck 75 centuries across the three international formats.

Kohli remains behind Australia's Smith and England's Joe Root in the number of Test centuries between the ""fabulous four"" -- the leading four batsmen of the modern era.

Smith overtook Kohli during the Indian batsman's lean phase and now has 30 Test centuries. Root -- who made five hundreds in 2022 -- has 29 and New Zealand's Kane Williamson has 26.

Kohli's previous Test hundred dates back to November 2019 against Bangladesh in a day-night game in India.

Kohli now stands fourth in the all-time Test century makers for India behind Sachin Tendulkar (51 -- the highest overall), Rahul Dravid (36) and Sunil Gavaskar (34).

Kohli had spoken about his mental health struggles during his dry phase, including how he had been ""snappy"" around his Bollywood actor wife Anushka Sharma, with whom he has a young daughter.

Pundits, among them former World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev, even suggested Kohli should be dropped during his lean phase last year.

The former top-ranked batsman revealed during the 2022 Asia Cup that only Mahendra Singh Dhoni sent him messages of support during a tough phase of mental struggle after quitting the Test captaincy.","[{'uri': 'agence_france_presse@dawn.com', 'name': 'Agence France-Presse', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person',

Kohli brought up Test century No.28 after flicking Nathan Lyon for a single and helping India push towards a crucial first-innings lead.

There was a gap of 41 innings between his last century and this one, with the previous one coming over three years ago against Bangladesh in November 2019.

Kohli scored a sublime 136 in India's only innings at the Eden Gardens and helped his team secure an innings and 46-run victory.

""600kg Gorilla off his back,"" Ravi Shastri boomed on commentary as Kohli raised his bat, then removed his helmet with a smile and kissed his necklace in relief to a standing ovation from the Ahmedabad crowd.

He now has eight Test hundreds against Australia, second-most, on par with Sunil Gavaskar on a list that is topped by Sachin Tendulkar, who has 11.

India's batting pillar Virat Kohli's form is back in whites. On day 3 of the game, he went to the pavilion unbeaten on 59 runs and resumed day 4 from where he last left it. When he completed his half-century, everyone in the dressing room started celebrating but there was one player whose style of celebration caught everyone's attention. It was Ishan Kishan who bowed down and made a gesture and his pictures went viral on social media. Kishan has warmed the bench in all four matches of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Virat Kohli then went on to register his 28th Test hundred in the ongoing fourth Test against Australia. Kohli reached the three-figure mark on the 241st ball he faced in his innings. Fans were anticipating that he will celebrate his century in style but Kohli kissed his wedding ring and celebrated in a calm manner. This was Kohli's eighth hundred against the Kangaroos in Test match cricket. The former India captain has now scored a total of 75 tons in international cricket.

Currently, India are 2-1 up in the series but they have to win this Test match in order to qualify for the final of the ICC World Test Championship final that is scheduled to take place at The Oval in London from June 7 to June 11.

Bharat, who has had a dreadful run with the bat, looked impressive as he pulled and hooked Cameron Green for a couple of sixes when he tried bouncing the batter from around the wicket.

He was out to a bat-pad catch at short-leg off Nathan Lyon's bowling and missed out on what could have been a confidence boosting half-century.

But once Bharat was out, Kohli hit a flurry of boundaries and also had Axar going after the bowling.

The pitch hasn't been easy for scoring with only 73 runs scored off 32 overs in the morning session.

Bharat, in fact, played the best shot of the morning, a slog sweep over cow corner off Nathan Lyon for a six.

The only wicket that India lost during the session was of Ravindra Jadeja (28 off 84 balls), who failed to clear Usman Khawaja at mid-on off Todd Murphy (2/86 in 38 overs).

Kohli has put his head down during his knock and it did allow the Australians to control the proceedings on a slow deck. The only time he got closest to hitting a boundary was a flick through mid-wicket off Cameron Green but Mitchell Starc cut it down to three runs.

He was then happy getting the occasional single and double to keep the scoreboard moving.

Bharat did look way more confident on a flat track and was more assured in his defence.

He put a big stride forward to negate the little bit of turn that was on offer for the Australian spinners.

The only one who got a couple of deliveries to break back sharply was Lyon (2/124 in 58 overs).",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motera', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Motera'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Left-arm orthodox spin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Run (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}]","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-98581673,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65250,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",eng-8469535,-0.003921568627450966,416310660,1,economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,Motera Nathan Lyon Batting (cricket) Test cricket India International cricket Fielding (cricket) Innings Wicket Axar Patel Boundary (cricket) Left-arm orthodox spin Cricket bat Bowling (cricket) Australia Ravindra Jadeja Usman Khawaja Mitchell Starc Spin bowling Run (cricket) Cricket pitch Australia national cricket team Over (cricket),India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,51,9,2023-03-12

""King Kohli"", one of cricket's biggest names, admitted last year to mental health struggles as his magic with the bat deserted him. He also lost the Indian captaincy, one of the most high-pressure jobs in world sport.

But on Sunday, having already returned to form with ODI and T20 centuries in recent months, the long wait for his 28th Test ton ended in the fourth Test against Australia.

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Saturday since January 2022, the landmark came after a patient innings of 241 balls as he eased Nathan Lyon for a single.

Appearing to tear up, the heavily tattooed 34-year-old acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room before kissing the locket on his gold chain as he smiled and looked up to the sky.

""A 600-kilo gorilla is off his back. He will grow a couple of inches taller by this evening,"" shouted commentator and former India coach Ravi Shastri.

Australia's stand-in-skipper Steve Smith applauded on the ground, and a placard in the crowd read ""Here to see King Kohli ruling in his kingdom"", as children in India shirts bowed in respect.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted: ""Good to see @imVkohli back scoring a Test ton .. Love watching him Bat .. Over 3 yrs since his last one ..

At tea, India were 472/5 in reply to Australia's first innings total of 480 runs.

All eyes were on Kohli in the post-lunch session, and he did not disappoint his fans as he ended his Test century drought by slamming an unbeaten 135. The iconic batsman had scored his last Test century on 22 November 2019 in a day-night Test against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens.

Kohli took 241 balls to reach triple figures, and it was his 75th century in international ton, and it has put India in a strong position in the match.

While Kohli hogged the limelight, Srikar Bharat showcased his batsmanship as to why coach Rahul Dravid and Captain Rohit Sharma trust in his abilities. But he fell before he could muster a fifty.

Axar Patel came in and batted extremely well, given the kind of form he is in. Australian bowlers toiled again and had only one wicket in the second session.

In the morning session, Kohli and the left-handed Rabindra Jadeja started cautiously against a persistent spin attack with Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy, applying pressure on them.

Jadeja, who adopted a defensive approach, tried an adventurous shot but ended up chipping it to mid-on where Usman Khawaja took the catch off Todd Murphy.

Kohli kept up the grind alongside Bharat, who was sent in because Shreyas Iyer went for scans after he complained of lower back pain following day three's play.

Brief Scores: Australia 480 (Usman Khawaja 180, Cameron Green 114; R Ashwin 6-91) lead India 472/5 (Virat Kohli 135*, Shubman Gill 128, Virat Kohli 88*, Cheteshwar Pujara 42; Todd Murphy 2-86) by 8 runs

At the time of tea break, India's score read 472/5 with Kohli (135)* and Axar Patel (38)* unbeaten at the crease. The hosts still trail by just 8 runs.

Kohli ended his Test century drought as he slammed his first Test century since November 2019.

After lunch, Indian batsmen Virat Kohli and Srikar Bharat opened their hands and slammed Australian bowlers at regular intervals for boundaries.

Cameron Green was on the receiving end with Srikar Bharat smashing him for 21 runs with the help of two boundaries and two sixes in an over.

Srikar Bharat's blistering stint at the crease came to an end as he was dismissed by Nathan Lyon for 44. The left-handed batter Axar Patel then came out to bat at the crease.

Kohli ended his Test century drought as he slammed his first Test century since November 2019. The former India captain brought up his much-needed hundred in 241 balls. It was the most-awaited ton as his last century came against Bangladesh in November 2019. With this century, he took his international century tally to 75.

Kohli continued his blistering form and slammed Mitchell Starc for brilliant two boundaries collecting 9 runs. Kohli along with Patel took India's total beyond the 400-run mark in the 140 overs of the game.

The duo of Kohli and Patel stitched up their 50-run partnership stand -the 6th consecutive 50-run partnership for Team India.

The Indian pair remained unbeaten as the visitors ended the session at 472/5.

Earlier, Kohli and Srikar Bharat showed remarkable skill and determination to frustrate the Australian bowling attack in the opening session of Day 4.

The batting pair of Ravindra Jadeja and Virat Kohli were decisive in their approach and made the Australian bowlers toil hard making merry of the excellent batting conditions on offer.

Australia skipper Steve Smith introduced Cameron Green into the attack in the very first over of day 4 and the bowler concede just 4 runs. Australia started with spin with Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy bowling in tandem from both ends.

The duo of Jadeja and Kohli took India's total beyond the 300-run mark in the 102nd over of the game. However, the 64-run partnership stand was broken by Murphy who dismissed Jadeja for 28 runs. Srikar Bharat then came out to bat.

The Indian batters rotated the strike brilliantly, not allowing the Australian bowlers to settle down while whacking the loose balls on offer.

Kohli and Srikar Bharat both were aggressors of the batting pair, smashing boundaries regularly. The duo stitched a solid 50-run partnership for Team India.

The Indian pair took India's score beyond the 350-run mark as the first session ended.

KS Bharat said no to a quick call of Kohli for a single.

In the ongoing 4th Day of the 4th Test between India and Australia, India is about to take the lead, courtesy of the two centurions viz. Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli. While Shubman Gill scored his century on Day 3, Day 4 belonged to Kohli, who registered a Test hundred after 3 and a half years. However, during the day an instance occurred where Virat Kohli's innings could have been cut short.

After Ravindra Jadeja got out, KS Bharat was promoted up the order. He did contribute to the Indian innings but at the start, he said no to a quick call of Kohli for a single. As a consequence Bharat had to endure a stare from Kohli, which fans refer to as the death stare. Take a look at what happened.

Following this episode, Bharat settled in his stride and added 84 runs with Kohli. Bharat showcased his explosive batting when he hit Cameron Green for 21 runs.

Soon after, Bharat departed after making 44 off 88 balls.

While a stare to KS Bharat was a small highlight of the day, the biggest one has to be Virat Kohli ending the century draught in Tests to mark 28th in the circuit. The moment that millions of fans were waiting for came in the 139th over of the innings when Kohli took a single off Nathan Lyon's delivery. The crowd erupted after Kohli reached the milestone of 75 international hundreds.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

Batting maestro Virat Kohli finally managed to end his Test century drought on Sunday by reaching the triple-figure mark on Sunday against Australia in the fourth and final Test match. Kohli showed grit and resilience to score his 28th Test century. It was a very long wait for the former India skipper as his 27th Test ton came way back in November 2019 against Bangladesh in a day-night Test.

Several things changed between Kohli's last two Test centuries as he was the skipper back then when he scripted history by scoring a ton in India's first day-night clash. While he relinquished the Test captaincy last year and now plays in the team as a specialist batter.

Kohli fought the demons both inside her mind and on the pitch to showcase his class as he took 241 deliveries to reach the triple-figure mark. Meanwhile, he struck just five boundaries en route to his ton.

Kohli has not scored a century for over three years in Test cricket and his last ton had come on 22 November 2019 against Bangladesh in a day-night Test at the Eden Gardens.

Kohli certainly enjoyed bringing up his 28th Test ton which was clear by his celebration as the batter kissed his wedding ring to celebrate the landmark. Now that the excruciating delay is over, we take a look at some of the mind-boggling numbers behind Kohli's wait for a Test century.

-- Kohli took 41 innings to get to his 28th Test ton after reaching the 27-hundred landmark. This is the longest wait for a Test century for Kohli. His previous longest wait was 11 innings between his 11th and 12th Test tons.

-- Kohli's Test ton drought and wait for the 28th century lasted for 1205 days.

-- Kohli took 241 balls to complete his 28th Test ton. This is his second slowest Test century after the 2012 ton against England in Nagpur when he took 289 balls to reach the three-figure mark.

-- This was Kohli's eighth Test ton against Australia. He has equalled Sunil Gavaskar in the tally for most centuries for an Indian batter against Australia. Only Sachin Tendulkar (11) is ahead of them.

-- With a century at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Kohli has now scored hundreds at 46 different venues. Sachin Tendulkar is the only player ahead of him, having scored centuries at 53 different venues.

-- Kohli also has 75 international hundreds now. He took just 552 innings to reach there, the fastest among all, surpassing Tendulkar's record of 566 innings.

-- Kohli's Test batting average dipped by 6.85 during his wait for the 28th ton.

-- While Kohli took over three years to score his latest Test century, Joe Root added 13 in the same period.

Virat Kohli quickly unclipped the helmet and gently raised it with the bat in his right hand. No exaggeration. No jumping fist pumps ala David Warner. No wide extension of the arms. Just a gentle raise of the willow to acknowledge the dressing room for a very brief moment. In a split second, the batting gear was on the ground, the gloves were removed as he reached out for the wedding ring around his neck. The eyes were shut and sweat off the forehead trickled down to the eyebrows as he planted a firm peck on the ring.

He was soaking it all in and the smile never left his lips even when the ring was neatly placed behind the Indian jersey. The home dugout was up on their feet and the opposition camp in the middle, led by Nathan Lyon, generously applauded as the 34-year-old continued to bask in this joyous occasion.

Sunday wasn't about the technicalities of batting, how he scored the runs, who he scored against and where they stood in the context of the game. That single in the 139th over, which gave Kohli his 100th run was a moment the entire country had waited for 1205 days.

It meant a lot. Not only to the man who had done it 74 times in international cricket already but also to the spectators who had braved the sun to see India's favourite son. No one wanted to rest in the shade when the great man was just a single away from the three-figure mark. They rushed, converged to the metal railings guarding the ground and had the smartphones out to capture the footage for their potentially viral Instagram reels.

Trilogy complete

With Kohli, the expectations never end because of the high standards he has set for himself and the followers of the game. When the century drought ended with the 122* against Afghanistan, expectations moved to ODIs. When he scored three digits in a little over a month, the focus moved to Tests. And the noise kept getting louder since the Bangladesh series and the ongoing home series vs Australia.

In every sense, the comeback is well and truly complete as the right-hander has put doubts to rest in T20Is, ODIs and Tests. All this in little over six months. Again, how he scored, and where he scored is not the talking point here. Kohli is.

For a player who has carried the weight of billions first as player then as captain and now again as player, he deserves this moment under the sun. The moment where he can afford a deep breath and a sigh of relief. He will go on to score more runs and tons in his already illustrious career but this would have meant the world to him.

The cool character

The celebrations weren't wild but it certainly gave a peek into the man he is now. He is no longer the West Delhi brat who would yell out, erm, ""Ben Stokes"", but a polished gentleman and father. He keeps a close check on the weight of his body and the food on his plate. The barren run without the ton did bring a different Kohli to the world.

Over the last few months, Kohli, the in-your-face character, has transformed into that cool figure who wouldn't mind sharing a laugh or two with the opposition camp and uncharacteristically engages in long friendly conversations in the middle.

There are numerous clips, now transformed into catchy reels, of Kohli's fiery days dominating Instagram timelines but off late the composed talk, the mature podcasts and the visits to seek divine blessings have outnumbered them.

Self-belief

On the eve of this century, a sedate Kohli reel popped up during some mindless scrolling and his words, at a BCCI awards function in 2017, made so much sense in the current scenario.

""I always wanted to be one of the top players in the world. For sure! So I understood what it would take me to maintain my form in all three formats, not just one format. Along my early days in my career, there have been people who have doubted the way I have gone about my game. Even now, there are doubters and haters all around,"" Kohli said while speaking to former India cricketer Farokh Engineer at the event which also had former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi in attendance.

""One thing is for sure I have always believed in myself. I have always believed in my heart that If I work hard 120% every day in my life, I am answerable to no one. And I think if I get an opportunity, I am going to win games for my country. And I try to do that every time I go out to bat,"" the star batter added.

Seeing him bat over the last few months, there's been no dearth of self-belief or the 120% work he had mentioned. The 34-year-old has been the first to hit the nets during the Border Gavaskar Trophy and has trained hard every day to get, as former India coach Ravi Shastri mentioned during commentary in a booming voice, ""600kg gorilla off his back"".

The visual of the 34-year-old taking the long staircase to the dressing room during the Tea interval felt poignant. It gave him, and the rest of us, a moment to reflect on what he had achieved after toiling hard under the sun for 1205 days. He wasn't woefully out of form but just short on runs. Now that they have started to flow, Kohli would hope to maintain a steady stream and keep the slope slippery for the ""600kg gorilla"".",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Warner_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'David Warner (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Glove'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Helmet'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Willow'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Instagram'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_cricket_team_against_Afghanistan_in_India_in_2018–19', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Irish cricket team against Afghanistan in India in 2018–19'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ben Stokes'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Handedness'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Metal'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Smartphone'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladesh'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladesh'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farokh_Engineer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Farokh Engineer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishan_Singh_Bedi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bishan Singh Bedi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Gorilla'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Podcast'}}]",https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/300x300/fixed/jpg/scalex16x9/2023/03/Kohli-Ahmedabad-Test-ton-640_Sportzpics.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1607843137254903,416313360,1,firstpost.com,news,Firstpost,Virat Kohli Test cricket Batting (cricket) India Nathan Lyon David Warner (cricketer) Cricket bat Glove One Day International Helmet Willow Instagram Irish cricket team against Afghanistan in India in 2018–19 International cricket Ben Stokes Captain (cricket) Twenty20 International Handedness Metal Smartphone Delhi Bangladesh Australia Farokh Engineer Bishan Singh Bedi Ravi Shastri Border–Gavaskar Trophy Gorilla Podcast,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,36,10,2023-03-12

Leading India's charge, Kohli went to notch his first Test ton in 3.5 years and is still going strong in the middle. The former India captain has also breached the 150-run mark and will now be looking to convert the knock into a double ton. (Follow: India vs Australia Live Score 4th Test, Day 4)

Kohli's superb effort also saw him overtake one of cricket's biggest legend Sachin Tendulkar in the process. This was Kohli's 75th international ton and it came way more quicker than Tendulkar took to reach the feat. Kohli achieved it in 552 innings, while Tendulkar had taken 14 more innings to complete the same.

Kohli is also placed second in the list of highest number of centuries, with only Tendulkar placed above him in the charts.

Kohli's heroics was well appreciated by the former cricketers and fans, who took to social media to share their reactions.

Meanwhile, fans got to see a different version of Kohli as he focused more on strike rotation rather than the boundaries. In fact, Kohli had knocked just five boundaries before completing his century. Stats wise this was the second slowest century by Kohli in the red-ball format. The talismanic batter took 241 balls to reach the milestone in Ahmedabad.

Kohli's slowest Test century came back in 2012, when he took 289 balls to reach the triple digit figure. This was also the longest gap between Kohli's two centuries as it came after a gap of 41 innings. He had last slammed a Test ton back in 2019 against Bangladesh, which was a pink-ball affair.

A look at his 'Virat' journey in white jersey,"India vs Australia: After three-and-half years of barrenness and scathing criticism, it finally came with a bang. A long wait of 1205 days to reach a three-figure runs ended as batting maestro Virat Kohli got the monkey off his back by scoring swashbuckling 28th Test century in the fourth Test of Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, which is going on at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. He bagged many accolades by scripting such a stupendous feat.

This is Kohli's 50th Test on the soil of his country, which was celebrated with a scintillating century. With his ton in today's match, Kohli- who was under a bit pressure in the beginning but grew confidence -- got success to replicate the cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar's grand achievement that was made 40 years ago. Gavaskar also made a century playing his 50th Test match at home in 1983. His ton is also recorded as the 8th Test century scored against Australia.

The Ahmedabad Test could also be seen as Kohli's first 50-plus score since January 2022, when made 79 against South Africa in Cape Town. Regaling spectators and cricket aficionados, the right-handed batter also leapfrogged West Indies former captain and legend batsman Brian Lara joining the club of cricketing elite. Kohli has zoomed past Lara's tally to become the second leading run scorer against the Australian team in the format of international cricket. He scored 4729 runs in 89 matches and 104 innings against Australia with 15 centuries and 24 fifties, while Lara on the other hand made 4714 runs in 82 matches and 108 innings with 12 centuries and 26 fifties against Aussies.

In his 75th in international cricket, Kohli's hundred came off 241 balls. His 291-ball innings perked up after he crossed the milestone. In the first session, Kohli could not make a single boundary. He also got huge support at the other end while adding 84 for the fifth wicket with Kona Bharat (44 off 88 balls) and another 63 with in-form Axar Patel. Resuming the day on 289/3, India lost their first wicket today when Todd Murphy (2/64) dismissed Ravindra Jadeja (28).

India reached 475 for five at tea as Kohli was unbeaten on 135 (291 balls; 10×4) alongside Axar Patel (38 not out; 75 balls, 3×4, 1×6). At the break, India trailed Australia by just eight runs.

2012: 116 runs in Adelaide

India locked horns with Australia in the final Test in the 2011-12 tour. Kohli made only 43 runs in the first two Tests, but he hit his first century in Adelaide in the 14th innings of his Test career.

2014: 169 runs in Melbourne

Kohli impressively scored 169 runs in Test against the deadly attack of Australia in 2013-14 tour. Making a solid 262-run partnership with Ajinkya Rahne, he helped India tie the match, where Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket.

2019: 254 runs in Pune

Making an outstanding contribution of 254, Virat Kohli marked his highest Test score against South Africa during the second match in Pune.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lara', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Brian Lara'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'West Indies cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cape Town'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Cape Town'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'MS Dhoni'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Not out'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Melbourne'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Melbourne'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Adelaide'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Adelaide'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Pune'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Pune'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/virat.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1294117647058823,416314020,1,financialexpress.com,news,The Financial Express,Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) Test cricket Australia Cricket Ahmedabad India Brian Lara Sunil Gavaskar Border–Gavaskar Trophy Narendra Modi Stadium International cricket Innings Axar Patel West Indies cricket team Australia national cricket team Wicket Captain (cricket) Cape Town South Africa Ravindra Jadeja MS Dhoni Not out Melbourne Adelaide Pune,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,47,10,2023-03-12

While the Indian batsmen looking quite comfortable against the Australia bowlers, veteran spinner Nathan Lyon was able to claim a massive milestone. With the dismissal of KS Bharat, Lyon became the highest overseas wicket-taker in Test matches on Indian soil. He currently has 55 wickets from 11 matches in India and he surpassed the record held by former England spinner Derek Underwood. Underwood had 54 wickets against India in away matches from 16 games with best figures of 5 for 84.

Virat Kohli finally ended his Test century drought as he slammed an outstanding ton to put India in a commanding position on Day 4 of the ongoing fourth Test match against Australia here at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

At the time of Tea, India's score read 472/5 with Kohli (135)* and Axar Patel (38)* unbeaten at the crease. The hosts still trail by just 8 runs.

Kohli ended his Test century drought as he slammed his first Test century since November 2019.

After Lunch, Indian batters Virat Kohli and Srikar Bharat opened their hands and slammed Australian bowlers at regular intervals for boundaries.

Cameron Green was on the receiving end with Bharat smashing him for 21 runs with the help of two boundaries and two sixes in an over.

Bharat's blistering stint at the crease came to an end as he was dismissed by Nathan Lyon for 44. The left-handed batter Axar Patel then came out to bat at the crease.

Kohli ended his Test century drought as he slammed his first Test century since November 2019. The former India captain brought up his much-needed hundred in 241 balls. It was the most-awaited ton as his last century came against Bangladesh in November 2019.

The Warrior': Twitter Explodes in Excitement as Axar Patel Scores his Third Fifty in BGT 2023,"Social media was buzzing with appreciation posts for Axar Patel for showcasing yet another top-class performance in the lower order

Indian all-rounder Axar Patel is known for his excellence with the bowl, especially on home turfs. But the ongoing Test series against Australia has brought out the brilliant batter hidden inside of him. In four games, he has picked up just 2 wickets in the series but in terms of scoring runs, he's right there at the third spot on the list with 264 runs, after Usman Khawaja (333) and Virat Kohli (290*).

The flat Ahmedabad track favoured almost everyone who swung his bat confidently, that too, for an extended period of time. Patience was the key and runs followed without any obstacle. Axar, who was already in great nick, once again enjoyed a phenomenal outing with the bat in hand and notched up his fourth Test half-century. Interestingly, it was his third fifty in the ongoing Test series.

After breaching the 50-run mark, Axar accelerated his innings and went after the Australian spinners. During his stay in the middle, the southpaw smashed 4 sixes and 5 boundaries, scoring 79 off 113 deliveries before getting cleaned up by Mitchell Stac.

The way he was taking his chances and hitting the spinners out of the park, it was a clear indication that once again Axar was rooting for a hundred, which he couldn't get in Nagpur and Delhi. But to his dismay, the wait for his maiden Test ton got extended a bit more.

Meanwhile, social media was buzzing with appreciation posts for Axar Patel for showcasing yet another top-class performance in the lower order.

Virat Kohli scored his first Test hundred after a gap of more than three years as India reached 472 for five at tea on day four of the fourth and final Test here on Sunday.

At the break, Kohli was batting on 135 and had Axar Patel (38 batting, 75 balls) for company.

Kohli and Axar feasted on the Australian bowling attack, Patel more so, who went on a rampage after completing his half-century. Axar hit three sixes and one four in a span of 10 balls as the Ahmedabad crowd were treated to watching their hometown hero making the Australians toil. Among these lusty blows, the one that takes the cake is the first six, which Axar smoked off Matthew Kuhnemann. Left-handed batters always fancy facing left-arm spinners as the angle makes it a tad easier for them to connect it. And boy, did Axar do exactly that. He lined himself up, bent down and slog swept the ball for an 80-meter six.

The ball sailed into the crowd where a youngster was left heartbroken upon putting it down. But the same could not be said about Kohli, who had the best seat in the house at the non-striker's end and enjoyed Axar's six to the core. Kohli followed the trajectory of the ball and couldn't help but show his excitement as just how cleanly Axar struck it. With a beaming smile, Kohli acknowledged his partner's hit as the proceedings carried forward.

Watch the video below:

Kohli and Axar had a blast batting together, as their constant chattering and laughs indicated. And rightfully so. As Kohli went about his business putting the Australians under the pump, watching Axar, who made his debut under Kohli many moons ago, would have been an extremely pleasing moment for the former India captain. Axar scored the third half-century of his Test career as he pummelled 79 off 113 balls, and together with Kohli, gave India the lead.

Axar and Kohli's highly entertaining partnership came to an end when India looked to up the ante. Axar played on to a delivery from Mitchell Starc, while Kohli, after battling cramps and running out of partners, holed out at deep mid-wicket for 186. India's innings came to an end at 571/9 after Shreyas Iyer was incapacitated enough to not bat, giving the hosts a first-innings lead of 91 against Australia, who were bowled out for 480 in the first innings.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/12/1600x900/kohli-axar-six_1678619221677_1678619227971_1678619227971.jpg,eng-8469535,0.06666666666666665,416316000,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia Ahmedabad Ravindra Jadeja Border–Gavaskar Trophy Axar Patel Cricket bat Wicket Batting (cricket) Spin bowling Boundary (cricket) Australia national cricket team Bowling (cricket) Mitchell Starc Fielding (cricket) Innings Shreyas Iyer Captain (cricket),India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,20,11,2023-03-12

He had just dispatched a Nathan Lyon delivery towards mid-wicket for a single.

The 40-month wait is over and Kohli has finally got his 28th Test hundred.

There were no clenched fists, no imaginary upper-cut like a pro boxer, and no giant leap in celebration.

There wasn't any customary cuss word either.

Instead, there was just relief written all over his face.

Kohli kissed his wedding ring tied to his necklace and acknowledged the crowd, unlike when he had completed a half-century.

During those 40 long months, Test runs dried up and average dipped to a lowly 25.

There was criticism all around and his legion of fans were kept waiting for the day when he would play a special knock to warm their hearts.

Great players have the knack of conquering the odds, and on Sunday Kohli crossed a major hurdle with the fighting spirit of a champion.

Kohli had to channelise his inner Muhammad Ali, who won the scrappy 12-round tactical battle against Joe Frazier in 1974.

It wasn't Kohli the fire-fighter who hit a spectacular straight six against Pakistan's Haris Rauf at the MCG during the T20 World Cup last year.

It was the scrappy Kohli, who was only looking at the three-figure mark at any cost.

Shades of Tendulkar's epic 241 at Sydney in Kohli's century

On Sunday, Kohli looked less like himself and more like Sachin Tendulkar, the man who didn't hit a cover drive till he had scored 200 against the Brett Lee-led Australian attack at Sydney in 2004.

In terms of joy and spectacle that Kohli's centuries are meant to be, the one in Ahmedabad would come lower down the pecking order -- perhaps not even among his his top-20 Test hundreds.

A look at Kohli's wagon wheel till he completed his 100 would look eerily similar to Tendulkar's wagon wheel in 2004.

Kohli stopped reaching out for deliveries outside off-stump.

The cover drive hardly came out of the closet and he was only willing whip deliveries outside off-stump in the arc between square leg and deep mid-wicket.

Sample this little statistical nugget: Kohli hit the fifth boundary of his innings off the 89th delivery he faced, and the sixth boundary came off the 251st delivery.

There were 162 deliveries (27 overs) in the interim, including one full session between fourth day's morning session that he faced and didn't hit a single four.

From his individual score of 60 till he reached the century mark, there were only singles and doubles.

It was arguably one of his slowest hundreds and came off 241 balls.

It wasn't as if he didn't play through the off-side but it was more close to the body and just trying to tap it for singles, save one off Matt Kuhnemann on the third evening, which he hit for a boundary.

Once the monkey was off his back, the customary Kohli panache was back and the boundaries flowed.

He stopped reaching for deliveries even when Mitchell Starc angled one across or when Cameron Green bowled in the fourth or fifth stump channel.

The first expansive cover drive came when he was on 145.

Kohli reached out to a wide half-volley from Green to get a boundary through extra cover.

The next delivery was a signature Kohli on-drive, which took him to 150.

The celebrations were even more muted compared to when he had reached his hundred.

This time, he didn't even take off his helmet.

The testimony to Kohli's fitness was running a three with Axar Patel when he was in his 160s.

Motera, over the years, has seen some major milestones, with Sunil Gavaskar's 10,000th run and Kapil Dev's then world record 432nd Test wicket, being a few of them.

Kohli's knock on Sunday will certainly joint that list.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Boxing'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Frazier', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Joe Frazier'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haris_Rauf', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Haris Rauf'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Melbourne Cricket Ground'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket World Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Muhammad Ali'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motera', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Motera'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapil_Dev', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kapil Dev'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}]",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2023/3/12/w600X390/ViratKohliscentury.jpeg,eng-8469535,0.1764705882352942,416316000,1,newindianexpress.com,news,The New Indian Express,Virat Kohli Test cricket Fielding (cricket) Ahmedabad Nathan Lyon Batting (cricket) Boxing Sydney Joe Frazier Haris Rauf South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21 Melbourne Cricket Ground Australia national cricket team Sachin Tendulkar Cricket World Cup Twenty20 Muhammad Ali Motera Sunil Gavaskar Axar Patel Kapil Dev Mitchell Starc Innings Over (cricket) Wicket Bowling (cricket),India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,20,11,2023-03-12

Virat Kohli finally ended his Test century drought as he slammed an outstanding ton to put India in a commanding position on Day 4 of the ongoing fourth Test match against Australia at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

The star batter finished his marathon innings at 186 runs, narrowly missing out on his 8th double century as he holed out to Marnus Labuschagne off Todd Murphy's bowling.

With an injury to Shreyas Iyer, Kohli was the last man to fall as India finished their innings at 571/9, establishing a lead of 91 runs against Australia.

Celebrating his 28th century, Kohli dedicated the monumental feat to his wife Anushka Sharma.

He acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room before kissing the locket on his gold chain as he smiled and looked up to the sky.

""A 600-kilo gorilla is off his back. He will grow a couple of inches taller by this evening,"" reckoned Ravi Shastri as the former Indian head coach lauded the batting icon during match commentary on Star Sports.

Even the Australian players acknowledged Kohli as they were seen clapping after Kohli reached triple figures.

Kohli ended his Test century drought as he slammed his first Test century since November 2019. The former India captain brought up his much-needed hundred in 241 balls. It was the most-awaited ton as his last century came against Bangladesh in November 2019. With this century, he took his international century tally to 75.

Making the most of great batting conditions at this venue, Kohli got to his century off the 241st delivery that he faced before eventually getting for 186 in an attempt to up the ante as India aim to try and push for a win.

With the help of Kohli's effort after Shubman Gill's ton earlier in the match, India managed to post 571 which managed to help India take a lead by 91 runs. Before the end of the day's play, India also bowled 6 overs conceding 3 runs but not managing to take a single wicket. In a bizarre move, Australia decided to open their second innings with number 11 batter Matthew Kuhnemann along with designated opener Travis Head but the two at least ensured that no wickets at Stumps on Day 4.

India too opened their bowling innings with Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja with the off-spinner bowling 3 overs and even producing an edge off the bat of Kuhnemann which couldn't be grabbed by wicketkeeper KS Bharat. Left-arm spinner Jadeja bowled a couple of overs before the hosts deciding to give the final over of the day to their pace spearhead Mohammed Shami.

Watch video","Virat Kohli ends his 3-year wait for a Test century, scoring his 28th hundred against Australia in Ahmedabad.Virat Kohli ended his long wait for a Test century on March 12 during the fourth Test match between India and Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The right-handed batsman had been waiting for 3 years to reach his 28th Test hundred. He achieved the milestone in the post-lunch session of Day 4, scoring his century off 241 balls with a single off Nathan Lyon. After reaching his century, Kohli celebrated with relief and ecstasy, kissing the wedding ring that he wore on his neck.

He had previously scored his 27th Test hundred in November 2019 during India's first Day-Night Test against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata but then had to wait a long time to score another Test century.

On March 11, the Delhi-born batter also ended his 13-month wait for a fifty in Test cricket. Kohli had gone 15 innings without a 50-plus score in red and pink-ball cricket after scoring a fifty in the Cape Town Test against South Africa in January 2022.

Before the fourth Test against Australia, Kohli had an average of around 26 in the World Test Championship (WTC) 2021-23, indicating that he was not having a great run in Test cricket.

However, he made amends with a hundred in Ahmedabad, his third hundred this year after the one he got against Sri Lanka in the ODI series. Kohli's century was an important milestone for him and the Indian team, as they aim to win the series against Australia.

It was a testament to his skill and determination, and he will be looking to build on this success in future Test matches.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2016', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Eden Gardens'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cape Town'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Cape Town'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}}}}]","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-98583491,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-26966,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",eng-8469535,0.1529411764705881,416317320,1,economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Narendra Modi Stadium Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016 Batting (cricket) Ahmedabad Australia Nathan Lyon Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020–21 Eden Gardens Kolkata ICC World Test Championship South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21 Innings India national cricket team One Day International Cricket Cape Town,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,42,11,2023-03-12

It was the scrappy Kohli, who was only looking at the three-figure mark at any cost

Virat Kohli had a disarming smile at the end of it all. He had just dispatched a Nathan Lyon delivery towards mid-wicket for a single.

The 40-month wait is over and Kohli has finally got his 28th Test hundred.

There were no clenched fists, no imaginary upper-cut like a pro boxer, and no giant leap in celebration. There wasn't any customary cuss word either.

Instead, there was just relief written all over his face. Kohli kissed his wedding ring tied to his necklace and acknowledged the crowd, unlike when he had completed a half-century.

During those 40 long months, Test runs dried up and average dipped to a lowly 25. There was criticism all around and his legion of fans were kept waiting for the day when he would play a special knock to warm their hearts.

Great players have the knack of conquering the odds, and on Sunday Kohli crossed a major hurdle with the fighting spirit of a champion.

Kohli had to channelise his inner Muhammad Ali, who won the scrappy 12-round tactical battle against Joe Frazier in 1974.

It wasn't Kohli the fire-fighter who hit a spectacular straight six against Pakistan's Haris Rauf at the MCG during the T20 World Cup last year. It was the scrappy Kohli, who was only looking at the three-figure mark at any cost.

On Sunday, Kolhi looked less like himself and more like Sachin Tendulkar, the man who didn't hit a cover drive till he had scored 200 against the Brett Lee-led Australian attack at Sydney in 2004.

In terms of joy and spectacle that Kohli's centuries are meant to be, the one in Ahmedabad would come lower down the pecking order -- perhaps not even among his his top-20 Test hundreds.

A look at Kohli's wagon wheel till he completed his 100 would look eerily similar to Tendulkar's wagon wheel in 2004.

Kohli stopped reaching out for deliveries outside off-stump. The cover drive hardly came out of the closet and he was only willing whip deliveries outside off-stump in the arc between square leg and deep mid-wicket.

Sample this little statistical nugget: Kohli hit the fifth boundary of his innings off the 89th delivery he faced, and the sixth boundary came off the 251st delivery.

There were 162 deliveries (27 overs) in the interim, including one full session between fourth day's morning session that he faced and didn't hit a single four.

From his individual score of 60 till he reached the century mark, there were only singles and doubles. It was arguably one of his slowest hundreds and came off 241 balls.

It wasn't as if he didn't play through the off-side but it was more close to the body and just trying to tap it for singles, save one off Matt Kuhnemann on the third evening, which he hit for a boundary.

Once the monkey was off his back, the customary Kohli panache was back and the boundaries flowed.

He stopped reaching for deliveries even when Mitchell Starc angled one across or when Cameron Green bowled in the fourth or fifth stump channel.

The first expansive cover drive came when he was on 145. Kohli reached out to a wide half-volley from Green to get a boundary through extra cover. The next delivery was a signature Kohli on-drive, which took him to 150. The celebrations were even more muted compared to when he had reached his hundred.

This time, he didn't even take off his helmet.

The testimony to Kohli's fitness was running a three with Axar Patel when he was in his 160s.

Veteran India batter Virat Kohli ended a more than three-year wait to score a Test century as he smashed 186 in the ongoing match against Australia in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

But it was Kohli's wife Anushka Sharma who revealed that the former India captain played through sickness during his 364-ball knock which put India ahead of Australia's first innings score on Day 4 of the fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Kohli's marathon innings lasted nearly 520 minutes and included 15 boundaries.

""Playing through sickness with this compusure. Inspiring me always,"" Anushka Sharma captioned her Instagram story after Kohli's latest Test hundred.

This was Kohli's first Test hundred since November 2019 and his 75th in international cricket overall.

Kohli's 28th Test century is also his 8th against the Aussies and 14th on home soil. It came after 1205 days of playing red-ball cricket.

Kohli equals Gavaskar's record

He also equalled cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar's tally of centuries in Tests.

The 34-year-old was finally dismissed by Todd Murphy in the final session of the penultimate day. He was the final Indian wicket to fall as the hosts reached 571 in 178.5 overs, 91 runs ahead of Australia's first innings score of 480.

Kohli was India's second centurion in the match after opener Shubman Gill, who made 128 but got out on the third day to Nathan Lyon.

Lyon and Murphy both took three wickets each while Matthew Kuhnemann and Mitchell Starc picked on each.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anushka_Sharma', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Anushka Sharma'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'First-class cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}]",https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2023-03/30478df3-9e0a-4194-aead-dacc4f74df7e/FrBEh1nWAAE7AD1.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C3900%2C2194&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,eng-8469535,0.1137254901960785,416317860,1,freepressjournal.in,news,Free Press Journal,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Anushka Sharma Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019 Australia national cricket team Batting (cricket) Captain (cricket) Ahmedabad Sunil Gavaskar Border–Gavaskar Trophy International cricket Cricket Australia Nathan Lyon Mitchell Starc First-class cricket Over (cricket) Wicket Shubman Gill,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,51,11,2023-03-12

After reaching a much-awaited ton - which was also his 75th in international cricket - Kohli became significantly more aggressive in his run-scoring, bringing the next fifty in only 70 balls.

As the situation demanded an increased pace of scoring with the match entering the third session on Day 4, Kohli's batting partner Axar Patel took the aerial route on multiple occasions, and the 34-year-old batter too, punished the poor deliveries with more regularity. After Axar's departure on 79, Kohli took on the onus of run-scoring but he ran out of partners with Ravichandran Ashwin and Umesh Yadav departing cheaply.

The situation was barely ideal for Kohli to take his time as India would've liked Australia to play a few overs before the end of the day's play. Kohli, thus, went for big hits and even had a catching opportunity dropped by Peter Handscomb on 185. However, the India star wasn't as lucky as he was caught in the very next over by Marnus Labuschagne, as Todd Murphy ended an incredible knock in Ahmedabad.

Following his dismissal, the Australian players including Steve Smith and Nathan Lyon lined up to congratulate Kohli on the knock.

Watch:

Kohli's first century against a 'SENA' country came in 2016 vs New Zealand, when he scored 211 in Indore. In the same year, the batter smashed another double hundred against England (235) in Pune.

In 2019, Kohli had smashed his seventh double century - which was also his last until Sunday - when he smashed his career-best 254 against South Africa in Pune. Both Kohli and Rahul Dravid - who is currently India's head coach - have 200s against three SENA countries; Dravid didn't score a double hundred against the Proteas.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International Cricket Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_South_Africa_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'English cricket team in South Africa in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Handscomb', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Peter Handscomb'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rahul Dravid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Smith (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Pune'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Pune'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/12/1600x900/virat_kohli_out_1678621023257_1678621023515_1678621023515.jpg,eng-8469535,0.09019607843137245,416317920,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Batting (cricket) International cricket International Cricket Council Boundary (cricket) Test cricket Umesh Yadav Ravichandran Ashwin Axar Patel Over (cricket) India Australia English cricket team in South Africa in 2019–20 Marnus Labuschagne Nathan Lyon Peter Handscomb Rahul Dravid South Africa national cricket team South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21 Steve Smith (cricketer) Century (cricket) Ahmedabad Indore Pune New Zealand,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,52,11,2023-03-12

While Kohli was superb with the bat, the former India skipper did make a rookie mistake of underestimating the opponent. The incident took place while Kohli was batting in his his 180s and was running out of partners.

With Umesh Yadav batting on the other end and fielders mostly placed close to the boundary ropes, Kohli along with the tailender plotted to steal a quick double. As planned he nudged the ball softly towards the on-side and straightaway took off for a double.

However, Kohli was stunned by a superb fielding effort by Peter Handscomb, who covered a good distance before knocking the stumps on the non-striker's end from the mid-wicket region. The terrific fielding effort by Handscomb brought an end to Umesh's stay in the middle, who returned to the pavilion without facing a single delivery.

Moments before the run-out, Kohli was heard directing Umesh to quickly steal a double, which was also mentioned by Dinesh Karthik during commentary. Here is the video:

India kicked-off Day 4 from the overnight score of 289/3, when they were still trailing by 191 runs. Kohli along with Ravindra Jadeja resumed the proceedings and added 81 runs to the overnight tally, before Jadeja was dismissed for 28 by Murphy.

Barring Kohli, Shubman Gill also scored a brilliant ton, accumulating 128 runs before being trapped LBW by Nathan Lyon.

Kohli, whose last Test century came way back in 2019, looked completely at ease against the Aussie bowlers and ended up scoring a well-deserved ton in 241 deliveries. With this century, Kohli ended up replicating a similar feat that legendary India batsman Sunil Gavaskar achieved around 40 years ago. This was Kohli's 50 Test match at home and he was able to score a century to celebrate the momentous occasion. Back in 1983, Gavaskar also scored a gritty hundred when he played his 50 Test match at home against West Indies in Delhi.

Kohli scored 186 as India ended their first innings at 571 in the series-deciding fourth and final Test against Australia. Resuming the penultimate day on 289 for three, India rode on Kohli's first Test century in more than three years to get past the Australian total in the final session.

Kohli, who was overnight 59, ran out of partners and got out for 186 in 364 balls (15x4) to give India a 91-run first innings lead. Injured Shreyas Iyer did come out to bat. All-rounder Axar Patel played a counter-attacking 79 from 113 balls (5x4, 4x6) in a 162-run partnership with Kohli.

It was a special innings for the former India skipper who last scored a century in 2019 and his last fifty also came around 14 months back. However, there were jitters at all for Kohli during the fourth Test match as he dominated all Aussie bowlers and slammed a deserved ton in 241 balls.

The moment when he reached the milestones sparked wild celebrations at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. Appearing to tear up, he acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room before kissing the locket on his gold chain as he smiled and looked up to the sky. Even the Australian players acknowledged Kohli as they were seen clapping after Kohli reached triple figures.

The star batsman resumed on his overnight score of 59 after he got his first Test half-century since January 2022 on day three on a pitch favouring the batsmen. He stitched together solid partnerships with Shubman Gill, KS Bharat and Ravindra Jadeja to hand India a 91-run lead in the first innings.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'West Indies cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'All-rounder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}]","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-03/deocob08_virat-kohli_625x300_12_March_23.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=675",eng-8469535,0.1843137254901961,416317920,1,sports.ndtv.com,news,NDTVSports.com,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Sunil Gavaskar Australia national cricket team Innings Ahmedabad Axar Patel West Indies cricket team All-rounder Cricket bat Shreyas Iyer Batting (cricket) Delhi Australia Ravindra Jadeja Cricket pitch Shubman Gill Captain (cricket) Cricket,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,52,11,2023-03-12

'King' Kohli, who hit his first Test century in over three years, surpassed his previous best of 169 against Australia in 2014 at the MCG.

Batting maestro Kohli's innings finally ended at the score of 186 in quest of his 8th double ton as he was losing partners quickly at the other end. Off-spinner Todd Murphy once again got rid of Kohli - fourth time in the series so far.

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Day 3 since January 2022, Kohli ended his long century drought after a gritty knock of 241 balls, which included only five boundaries, with a single off Nathan Lyon.

The 34-year-old Kohli acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room in a very subtle way before kissing his wedding ring on his chain and looked up to the sky.

The former Indian captain has a Test average of over 48 in 108 matches since making his debut in 2011 and has struck 75 centuries across the three international formats.

Kohli's previous Test hundred came way back in November 2019 against Bangladesh in a day-night game at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.

Kohli stands fourth in the all-time Test century list for India behind Sachin Tendulkar (51), Rahul Dravid (36) and Sunil Gavaskar (34).",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Melbourne Cricket Ground'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Off spin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rahul Dravid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Eden Gardens'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98583896,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-26112,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",eng-8469535,0.09019607843137245,416317920,1,timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,Virat Kohli Test cricket Australia Narendra Modi Stadium Melbourne Cricket Ground Innings Batting (cricket) Ahmedabad Delhi India Off spin Sunil Gavaskar Nathan Lyon Rahul Dravid Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Eden Gardens Sachin Tendulkar Captain (cricket) Kolkata,India,IN,,,Center-right,ChatGPT,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,52,11,2023-03-12

At the end of the final session on day 4, Australia was at 3/0, with Matt Kuhnemann (0*) and Travis Head (3*) unbeaten on the crease. Australia trail by 88 runs.

India started the final session at 472/5 with Kohli (135*), Patel (38*) unbeaten at the crease.

India brought up their 500-run mark in 163.5 overs.

Axar continued with his aggressive batting, hitting Kuhnemann for three sixes, including two sixes in a single over.

Australia continued to make a short comeback into the match, dismissing Ravichandran Ashwin (7) and Umesh Yadav (0) before they could build a solid partnership with Virat. Ashwin became Lyon's third wicket after being caught by Matt Kuhnemann at deep-midwicket while Umesh was run out.

The duo of Jadeja and Kohli took India's total beyond the 300-run mark in the 102nd over of the game. However, the 64-run partnership stand was broken by Murphy who dismissed Jadeja for 28 runs. Srikar Bharat then came out to bat.

The Indian batters rotated the strike brilliantly, not allowing the Australian bowlers to settle down while whacking the loose balls on offer.

Earlier, on day 4, Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja resumed the Indian innings from 281/3. Jadeja played a rash shot to throw his wicket away for 28 as Kohli also looked stunned by his teammate's shot-selection.

While Kohli joined hands with wicketkeeper batter KS Bharat who was under the scanner before the match for his under-par show with the bat in first three Tests. However, Bharat scored crucial 44 runs and shared a solid 84-run stand with Kohli to revive India's innings.

However, Bharat became a victim of Nathan Lyon and missed his maiden international half-century. It was a bit of soft dismissal as the ball took the edge of his bat and hit the pad before Peter Handscomb took a catch at sweeper cover.

After Bharat's departure, Axar Patel came in the middle as he once again displayed his batting prowess and scored 79 runs. He shared a massive 162-run stand for the sixth wicket with Kohli which helped India take a crucial lead.

Meanwhile, the day completely belonged to Kohli as he ended his Test century drought in a productive afternoon session to bring India on the verge of taking the lead against Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium.

Kohli got his long-awaited hundred in 241 balls, his second slowest century after his ton against England in the 2012/13 series coming off 289 balls, showing utmost discipline, determination and patience to play a long innings and get India into a strong position.

Meanwhile, middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer didn't come out to bat on Sunday as he complained about pain in his back.

""Shreyas Iyer complained of pain in his lower back following the third day's play. He has gone for scans and the BCCI Medical Team is monitoring him,"" the board said.

The tail didn't give much support to Kohli as in the end he had to go for big shots and he eventually got dismissed by Todd Murphy for 186. His 36-4 ball marathon knock was laced with 15 boundaries.",[],"[{'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': ""Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwatchman_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nightwatchman (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Handscomb', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Peter Handscomb'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket-keeper'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_South_Africa_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'English cricket team in South Africa in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting order (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Board of Control for Cricket in India'}}]",https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/03/collage-maker-12-mar-2023-05-24-pm-5922.jpg,eng-8469535,0.06666666666666665,416318220,1,news18.com,news,News18,Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019 Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Over (cricket) Australia Nightwatchman (cricket) Ravindra Jadeja Travis Head Stump (cricket) Cricket bat Wicket Batting (cricket) Nathan Lyon Peter Handscomb Wicket-keeper English cricket team in South Africa in 2019–20 Narendra Modi Stadium Axar Patel Batting order (cricket) Shreyas Iyer Board of Control for Cricket in India,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,57,11,2023-03-12

Former India skipper Virat Kohli on Sunday scored his 28th Test century after a gap of more than three years. Kohli achieved the feat on Day 4 of the ongoing fourth Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia. Kohli reached the three-digit mark in Tests for the first time in 1205 days. His last Test ton was against Bangladesh in 2019. After smashing a hundred in India's first innings of the match, Kohli began to amass runs quickly and managed to finish at a score of 186 off 364 balls. He was eventually dismissed by Todd Murphy in the final session of the day.

With his century, Kohli broke multiple records in the longest format of the game. Kohli has now become India's highest run-scorer in World Test Championship history. The 34-year-old now has 1803 runs from 31 matches at an average of 36.79. Kohli also registered his highest individual score against Australia in Test cricket.

Virat Kohli had a disarming smile at the end of it all. He had just dispatched a Nathan Lyon delivery towards mid-wicket for a single.

The 40-month wait is over and Kohli has finally got his 28th Test hundred.

There were no clenched fists, no imaginary upper-cut like a pro boxer, and no giant leap in celebration. There wasn't any customary cuss word either.

Instead, there was just relief written all over his face. Kohli kissed his wedding ring tied to his necklace and acknowledged the crowd, unlike when he had completed a half-century.

During those 40 long months, Test runs dried up and average dipped to a lowly 25. There was criticism all around and his legion of fans were kept waiting for the day when he would play a special knock to warm their hearts.

Great players have the knack of conquering the odds, and on Sunday Kohli crossed a major hurdle with the fighting spirit of a champion.

Kohli had to channelise his inner Muhammad Ali, who won the scrappy 12-round tactical battle against Joe Frazier in 1974.

It wasn't Kohli the fire-fighter who hit a spectacular straight six against Pakistan's Haris Rauf at the MCG during the T20 World Cup last year. It was the scrappy Kohli, who was only looking at the three-figure mark at any cost.

The Sydney discipline of Tendulkar

On Sunday, Kolhi looked less like himself and more like Sachin Tendulkar, the man who didn't hit a cover drive till he had scored 200 against the Brett Lee-led Australian attack at Sydney in 2004.

In terms of joy and spectacle that Kohli's centuries are meant to be, the one in Ahmedabad would come lower down the pecking order -- perhaps not even among his his top-20 Test hundreds.

A look at Kohli's wagon wheel till he completed his 100 would look eerily similar to Tendulkar's wagon wheel in 2004.

Kohli stopped reaching out for deliveries outside off-stump. The cover drive hardly came out of the closet and he was only willing whip deliveries outside off-stump in the arc between square leg and deep mid-wicket.

Sample this little statistical nugget: Kohli hit the fifth boundary of his innings off the 89th delivery he faced, and the sixth boundary came off the 251st delivery.

There were 162 deliveries (27 overs) in the interim, including one full session between fourth day's morning session that he faced and didn't hit a single four.

From his individual score of 60 till he reached the century mark, there were only singles and doubles. It was arguably one of his slowest hundreds and came off 241 balls.

It wasn't as if he didn't play through the off-side but it was more close to the body and just trying to tap it for singles, save one off Matt Kuhnemann on the third evening, which he hit for a boundary.

Once the monkey was off his back, the customary Kohli panache was back and the boundaries flowed.

He stopped reaching for deliveries even when Mitchell Starc angled one across or when Cameron Green bowled in the fourth or fifth stump channel.

The first expansive cover drive came when he was on 145. Kohli reached out to a wide half-volley from Green to get a boundary through extra cover. The next delivery was a signature Kohli on-drive, which took him to 150. The celebrations were even more muted compared to when he had reached his hundred.

This time, he didn't even take off his helmet.

The testimony to Kohli's fitness was running a three with Axar Patel when he was in his 160s.

Motera, over the years, has seen some major milestones, with Sunil Gavaskar's 10,000th run and Kapil Dev's then-world record 432nd Test wicket, being a few of them.

Kohli's knock on Sunday will certainly join that list.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Boxing'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Frazier', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Joe Frazier'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haris_Rauf', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Haris Rauf'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Melbourne Cricket Ground'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket World Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Muhammad Ali'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapil_Dev', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kapil Dev'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}]",https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/styles/largehorizontal/public/articleimages/2023/03/12/virat-kohli-celebrates-his-ton-credit-reuters-photo-1199470-1678621557.jpg?itok=ZNiwgq5R,eng-8469535,0.1764705882352942,416318940,1,deccanherald.com,news,Deccan Herald,Virat Kohli Test cricket Fielding (cricket) Over (cricket) Nathan Lyon Sachin Tendulkar Batting (cricket) Boxing Sydney Joe Frazier Haris Rauf South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21 Melbourne Cricket Ground Australia national cricket team Cricket World Cup Twenty20 Muhammad Ali Ahmedabad Sunil Gavaskar Axar Patel Kapil Dev Mitchell Starc Innings Shreyas Iyer Wicket Bowling (cricket) One Day International,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,9,12,2023-03-12

Kohli looked rock solid in his performance and displayed a high level of patience and skill at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad

IND vs AUS 4th Test: India and Australia battled it out on the fourth day of the fourth test in the Border Gavaskar series. Virat Kohli powered the Indian team to make a strong response to Australia's first innings target of 480. The former Indian captain smashed his 28th test ton and agonisingly missed out on a well-deserved double ton as he fell for 186. Meanwhile, Australian openers go unbeaten for 3/0 and still trail by 88 runs.

It was some day of test cricket as India dominated the proceedings left, right and centre. Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja started India's batting with a steady approach before the latter fell in the opening session. Meanwhile, Kohli found many more partners in the form of KS Bharat, Axar Patel and Ravi Ashwin to power India to a huge score. The hosts have also registered a unique feat in test cricket.

The Indian team has become only the third team in the history of test cricket to notch a stand of over 50 runs for each of the first six test wickets. Indian batters were on display in Ahmedabad as everyone contributed decently to help India in the first innings. All the first six partnerships were over 50. The only other teams to have made such a record are Australia in 1960 and Pakistan in 2015.

Kohli's masterclass, Axar's fire

Former Indian captain Virat Kohli ended a much-awaited wait for a hundred in test cricket when he smashed his 28th test ton in the 4th match against Australia. Kohli looked rock solid in his performance and displayed a high level of patience and skill at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad to bring up another hundred in International cricket. He also equalled a big feat of Indian legend Sunil Gavaskar.

Axar Patel was also on song in India's batting. He made a quick 79 off 113 balls. India were cautious in the first session as they got only 73 runs while losing a wicket. The hosts thereafter changed gears with KS Bharat smashing Cameron Green for twin sixes in the second session. Even after Bharat's fall, India kept taking big steps in their bid for a decent lead. Patel started steadily before finding his foot on the paddle. Ashwin and the tail were done cheaply and Shreyas Iyer did not come out to bat due to a back problem.

Australia came out to bat for 5 overs and were put under the pump by India. Ashwin and Jadeja kept asking questions from Travis Head and new opener Matthew Kuhnemann, who came in for an injured Usman Khawaja. Australia ended the day 3/0 and still trail by 88 runs. India will eye a win and would like to get the visitors out soon. It is all set for a mouthwatering end to the match.","[{'uri': 'varun_malik@indiatvnews.com', 'name': 'Varun Malik', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Not out'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}]",https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2023/03/india-7-1678622684.jpg,eng-8469535,0.03529411764705892,416319180,1,indiatvnews.com,news,India TV News,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia India national cricket team Ahmedabad Sunil Gavaskar Narendra Modi Stadium Axar Patel Not out Batting (cricket) Captain (cricket) Ravindra Jadeja Ravichandran Ashwin Wicket Travis Head Usman Khawaja Boundary (cricket) Over (cricket) Cricket bat Shreyas Iyer Cricket,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,13,12,2023-03-12

Thanks to Virat Kohli and Axar Patel, the Test is on the verge of a draw.

Team India gave another solid show for Australia with the bat on Day 4 of the fourth and final Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday. The hosts finished their first innings at 571, earning a 91-run lead, thanks to twin centuries from Shubman Gill (128) and Virat Kohli (186). At the same time, Axar Patel (79) also played a vital knock, pushing the Test to the brink of a draw, while fans were delighted by the Indian performance.

Resuming at 289/3, India lost Ravindra Jadeja (28) 20 runs later to off-spinner Todd Murphy. Nevertheless, Kohli and KS Bharat (44) tailored an 84-run partnership for the fifth wicket before the latter fell to veteran off-spinner Nathan Lyon at 393. However, at this time, Kohli brought up his 28th Test century and his first in over four years, while with Axar, he put on a 162-run stand for the sixth wicket, allowing India to take the lead before the latter was forced to play on by seamer Mitchell Starc.

Following Axar's dismissal, there were barely any convincing stands for India, with Kohli being the final wicket to fall to Murphy after the Australians had pushed all its fielders to the boundary in a bid to stop him from getting to his eighth Test double-ton. India's innings terminated at the fall of the ninth wicket as middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer did not arrive at the venue after complaining of back pain.

For the Aussies, Lyon and Murphy grabbed three wickets each, while the former was considerably economical. As for the second innings, Australia carefully batted out the day for six overs, scoring just three runs, with Travis Head (3*) and Matthew Kuhnemann (0) at the crease.

Talismanic batter Virat Kohli showed impeccable grit, discipline and concentration to make a magnificent 186 as India took a 91-run lead over Australia after being bowled out for 571 in their first innings during the fourth Test at Motera stadium on Sunday.

At stumps, Australia reached 3/0 in six overs of their second innings and trail India by 88 runs with just one day left in the match. Travis Head making all the runs, as he and makeshift opener Matthew Kuhnemann, negotiated the tricky six overs from Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami.

If Shubman Gill was the talk of the town with his sparkling 128 on Saturday, it was Kohli's turn to be in the spotlight on Sunday to break his drought of Test century which lasted 1025 days through his determined 364-ball stay at the crease, hitting 15 boundaries and enthralling a sizeable Sunday crowd.

He was also supported by a nice 44 from KS Bharat and an excellent 79 from Axar Patel. For Australia, Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy took three wickets each while Mitchell Starc and Matthew Kuhnemann took a scalp each.

After 3.3 overs into the start of final session, Axar got India in the lead by cutting Todd Murphy through backward point for four.

Virat Kohli marked the final Test between India and Australia in the Border-Gavaskar series with a memorable knock as he registered his 75th international ton.

The 34-year-old's brilliant 186-run stand was complimented well by Axar Patel's 79-run knock off 113 deliveries.

""I am feeling good to have contributed with the bat"", said the 29-year-old after India posted 571 runs on the board thanks to the efforts of Axr, Kohli and opener Shubman Gill.

This was Axar's third fifty in the home series against Australia, following his 84 runs in Nagpur, and 74 in the Delhi Test.

""I've had the confidence to go after ones that I can hit, the talk in the 1st Test is what I'm following and I'm gaining a bit of information about my ability with the bat,"" said the man from Gujarat.

When quizzed if he was asked to get some runs on the board quickly, the left-hander said, ""I had no set role, just wanted to make as many runs as possible, bat along with the ball not doing a lot.""

The all-rounder said that the wicket was coherent to bat on after settling in as he once again proved crucial to the Indian batting order.

""Once you're set, it's easier to bat, the odd ball is turning and staying low, it's slightly difficult when you're new to the crease, but once you adjust, it's still easy to bat on this wicket.""

India managed to bat their way through to a 91 run-lead after having bowled out visitors Australia for 480 runs in the first two days of the fourth Test in Ahmedabad.

Gill's patient 128 runs off 235 deliveries helped India get off to a good start before Kohli brought up his first Test ton since November 2019 and made it count.

There were also sizeable contributions from veteran cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara, who fell eight runs short of a fifty and wicketkeeper Srikar Bharath would put up a 44-run knock.

Shreyas Iyer couldn't come out to the crease due to an injury concern as India set out to bowl at the Australians for nearly 20-odd minutes before the umpire took off the bails to signal the end of Day 4 at Motera.

Virat Kohli ended his agonising wait for a Test century with a painstaking 186 as India racked up 571 to claim a lead of 91 in the fourth and final Test against Australia on Sunday.

The hosts, who lead the series 2-1, strung together six 50-plus partnerships at the top to effectively put themselves in an unbeatable position heading into the final day of the contest.

Having conceded a handy first-innings lead, Australia finished day four on three for no loss.

The touring side sent nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann to open with Travis Head after in-form opener Usman Khawaja hurt his knee while fielding.

Kuhnemann, who survived 18 balls, was nearly caught on two occasions but Australia somehow saw off the final six overs without any damage.

Earlier, India lost Ravindra Jadeja (28) after resuming on 289-3 but Kohli and KS Bharat denied Australia another success in that slow-moving session.

Todd Murphy (3-113) broke Kohli's 64-run partnership with Jadeja, who chipped the ball to Khawaja at mid-on.

Kohli was happy to nudge the ball around, while Bharat hit Nathan Lyon for a six before putting his head down and accumulating runs without taking too many risks.

Promoted in the batting order as Shreyas Iyer did not bat because of back pain, Bharat accelerated after the lunch break, hitting Green for back-to-back sixes and following it with a four in a 21-run over.

Bharat fell to Lyon after making 44, but Kohli could not be denied his first Test hundred since November 2019.

The right-hander took a single off Lyon to bring up his 75th international century. Kohli kissed the locket of his necklace and looked skywards in a muted celebration.

Patel, who smashed four sixes and five fours in his belligerent 79, continued his red-hot form with the bat, registering his third half-century of the series.

The left-hander smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over and was looking good for a maiden Test hundred before he dragged a Mitchell Starc delivery on to his stumps.

Patel's 162-run stand for the sixth wicket with Kohli was the highest in the Indian innings.

With Ravichandran Ashwin and Umesh Yadav falling in quick succession and Iyer not available to bat, Kohli realised he was running out of partners and tried to accelerate.

He became the last Indian wicket to fall, holing out to Marnus Labuschagne at long-on to depart after a 364-ball knock, which included 15 fours.

Lyon alone bowled 65 of Australia's 178.5 overs on a flat track where bowlers found little assistance.

India are chasing a victory in Ahmedabad to confirm their place in the final of the World Test Championship against Australia in June.","[{'uri': 'reuters@khaleejtimes.com', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwatchman_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nightwatchman (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting order (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=ddfb15fe-5dce-54eb-a12d-b8dfc5fbd91a&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.81374&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.09403,eng-8469535,0.04313725490196085,416319480,1,khaleejtimes.com,news,Khaleej times,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia Usman Khawaja Nightwatchman (cricket) Ravindra Jadeja Travis Head Boundary (cricket) Nathan Lyon Batting order (cricket) Fielding (cricket) Over (cricket) Cricket bat Shreyas Iyer Umesh Yadav Marnus Labuschagne Ravichandran Ashwin Mitchell Starc ICC World Test Championship Stump (cricket) Innings Wicket Bowling (cricket) Ahmedabad,United-Arab-Emirates,AE,?,,Center,ChatGPT,C19,C9,Asia,AS,Muslim,44.0,50.0,146.0,38.0,78.0,32.0,22.0,22.0,26.0,47.0,33.0,42.0,119.0,74.0,36.0,52.0,66.0,22.0,22.0,?,?,?,?,Arab League,AL,Arabic-speaking,Ara,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,18,12,2023-03-12

In today's match, the Indian innings finally came to an end with Virat Kohli's masterful 186 as he became the last batter to be dismissed. India made 571-all out and took a lead of 91 runs. Kohli's last Test century came way back in 2019. Also, this was Kohli's 50th Test match at home and he was able to score a century to celebrate the occasion. Kohli's fans had to wait 40 months for this moment. To be precise, 1205 days in total.

While it was a treat for everyone who was on the field, witnessing the match live, many took to Twitter and hailed the king. ""Congratulations on your 75th international 100 @imVkohli @BCCI. I wish you all the best for all the upcoming tournaments. Keep going strong. God bless,"" wrote Amit Mishra on Twitter. Another person wrote, ""BOW DOWN TO THE KING! Virat Kohli missed out on a well-deserved double ton, but he put on a performance to cherish before departing.""

In a pitch where batters had fun, Axar Patel too showed his prowess, hitting a strokeful 79 but fell as he was looking to score at a quick pace. Kohli scored 186 and was the last man to be dismissed as Indian innings came to an end on 571 with an overall lead of 91. Shreyas Iyer didn't bat as he went for scan in the morning after complaining of pain in his lower back. Australia came out to bat late in the third session. Surprisingly, they opened with nightwatchman Matthew Kuhnemann alongside specialist opener Travis Head. The pair saw through the six overs safely.

But on Sunday, having already returned to form with ODI and T20 centuries in recent months, the long wait for his 28th Test ton ended in the fourth Test against Australia.

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Saturday since January 2022, the landmark came after a patient innings of 241 balls as he eased Nathan Lyon for a single.

Appearing to tear up, the 34-year-old acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room before kissing the locket on his gold chain as he looked up to the sky.

""A 600-kilo gorilla is off his back. He will grow a couple of inches taller by this evening,"" shouted commentator and former India coach Ravi Shastri.

Australia's stand-in-skipper Steve Smith applauded on the ground, and a placard in the crowd read ""Here to see King Kohli ruling in his kingdom"".

Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted: ""Good to see @imVkohli back scoring a Test ton .. Love watching him Bat .. Over 3 yrs since his last one .. My guess is a few might come along now"".

Kohli had a tough 2021 and 2022, failing to reach three figures in over 1,000 days.

He quit as Twenty20 skipper in late 2021 and in January 2022 was sacked from the one-day captaincy and gave up leading the Test side too.

But he hit his first ton after 1,020 days in the Asia Cup T20 tournament in September last year and hasn't looked back since.

Kohli finished the T20 World Cup in Australia last year as the leading run-scorer and then hit three ODI centuries including two - 113 and 166 not out - against Sri Lanka in January.

Kohli remains behind Australia's Smith and England's Joe Root in the number of Test centuries between the ""fabulous four"" - the leading four batsmen of the modern era.

Smith overtook Kohli during the Indian batsman's lean phase and now has 30 Test centuries. Root - who made five hundreds in 2022 - has 29 and New Zealand's Kane Williamson has 26.

Kohli's previous Test hundred dates back to November 2019 against Bangladesh in a day-night game in India.

India were eventually bowled out for 571 with Kohli making 186, following Australia's first innings total of 480. The Aussies resume on day five on three without loss, trailing by 88, as the match heads for a draw.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2016', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Vaughan', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Michael Vaughan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Smith (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'England cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Joe Root'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2017–18', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2017–18'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_Williamson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kane Williamson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket World Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}]",https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/7NZzZeU8T_ms9q7K7uX1JTfkc5o=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(739x405:749x415)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thenational/VBRFJASTJNGPLORA6XVEUSDWCE,eng-8469535,0.1137254901960785,416319600,1,thenationalnews.com,news,The National,Virat Kohli Captain (cricket) Test cricket India Twenty20 Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016 One Day International Cricket Ahmedabad Australia Michael Vaughan Ravi Shastri Nathan Lyon Steve Smith (cricketer) Innings England cricket team Twitter Joe Root Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2017–18 Asia Cup Kane Williamson Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020–21 Cricket World Cup Bowling (cricket) Batting (cricket) New Zealand,United-Arab-Emirates,AE,English,eng,Pro-government,https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiThe_National_(Abu_Dhabi),C19,C9,Asia,AS,Muslim,44.0,50.0,146.0,38.0,78.0,32.0,22.0,22.0,26.0,47.0,33.0,42.0,119.0,74.0,36.0,52.0,66.0,22.0,22.0,?,?,?,?,Arab League,AL,Arabic-speaking,Ara,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,20,12,2023-03-12

Kohli has now become India's highest run-scorer in WTC history.

Former India skipper Virat Kohli smashed his 28th century in Test cricket during the ongoing fourth match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia on Sunday. Kohli scored 186 off 364 balls including 15 boundaries. This is Kohli's first century in red-ball cricket in more than 1200 days. He last scored a Test in a pink-ball match against Bangladesh in November 2019. Kohli's knock in India's first innings of the ongoing match against Australia is one of his best innings in Test cricket.

Meanwhile, it has now emerged that Kohli played the marathon innings in Ahmedabad with a fever. Bollywood actor Anushka Sharma took to her Instagram handle to reveal that Kohli played through sickness. She shared a story on her official account, where she wrote, ""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always,"" Anushka wrote. Kohli did not come out to the field during Australia's second innings on Day 4. Suryakumar Yadav took his place for the remaining overs in the day.

With his century, Kohli broke multiple records in the longest format of the game. Kohli has now become India's highest run-scorer in World Test Championship history. The 34-year-old now has 1803 runs from 31 matches at an average of 36.79. Kohli also registered his highest individual score against Australia in Test cricket. Kohli is now the highest run-scorer for India in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He has amassed 297 runs from four matches at an average of 49.50. Earlier, Kohli equaled Sunil Gavaskar's record for the joint second-most tons by an Indian player against Australia, trailing only Sachin Tendulkar.

Thanks to Kohli's century and quickfire contributions from Axar Patel, India finished Day 4 with a first-innings lead of 91 runs. India scored a mammoth 571 runs and that too without Shreyas Iyer coming to bat. Earlier, Shubman Gill scored a magnificent century to help India reach a huge total in the first innings.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anushka_Sharma', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Anushka Sharma'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'First-class cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Suryakumar Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/vpj5jssaysr8pflm_1678622606.jpeg,eng-8469535,0.1372549019607843,416319600,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia Border–Gavaskar Trophy Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Anushka Sharma First-class cricket Captain (cricket) Cricket Over (cricket) Suryakumar Yadav Ahmedabad Sunil Gavaskar Axar Patel ICC World Test Championship Cricket bat Sachin Tendulkar Shreyas Iyer Shubman Gill,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,20,12,2023-03-12

""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always,"" Sharma wrote on her story after Kohli's 75th international ton.

Resuming his innings at 59 off 128 on Sunday, Kohli took his time to score the remaining 41 runs. Off 241 deliveries, only scoring five fours in what was a gritty knock in the first innings.

The last hundred Kohli scored was against Bangladesh in the pink ball Test at the Eden Gardens in November 2019. While the former India skipper had scored his maiden T20I hundred last year in the Asia Cup and three more in the ODIs over the last three months, his scores in the longest format had been a cause of worry for the Indian team.

With the hosts having lost Ravindra Jadeja early in the first session on Sunday, Kohli stitched together 84-runs for the fifth wicket alongside KS Bharat (44 off 88) to put India closer to Australia's 480 in the first innings.

The 34-year-old, who notched his fifty on day three, had come in to bat when Australia broke the 113-run partnership between Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara and was at the non-striker's end when Gill got to his century at Motera.

Kohli would ultimately score 186, falling just short of a double ton as India ended their first innings at 571 in the fourth and final Test against Australia.

The hosts, who lead the series 2-1, strung together six 50-plus partnerships at the top to effectively put themselves in an unbeatable position heading into the final day of the contest.

Having conceded a handy first-innings lead, Australia finished day four on three for no loss.

The touring side sent nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann to open with Travis Head after in-form opener Usman Khawaja hurt his knee while fielding.

Kuhnemann, who survived 18 balls, was nearly caught on two occasions but Australia somehow saw off the final six overs without any damage.

Earlier, India lost Ravindra Jadeja (28) after resuming on 289-3 but Kohli and KS Bharat denied Australia another success in that slow-moving session.

Todd Murphy (3-113) broke Kohli's 64-run partnership with Jadeja, who chipped the ball to Khawaja at mid-on.

Kohli was happy to nudge the ball around, while Bharat hit Nathan Lyon for a six before putting his head down and accumulating runs without taking too many risks.

Promoted in the batting order as Shreyas Iyer did not bat because of back pain, Bharat accelerated after the lunch break, hitting Green for back-to-back sixes and following it with a four in a 21-run over.

Bharat fell to Lyon after making 44, but Kohli could not be denied his first test hundred since November 2019.

The right-hander took a single off Lyon to bring up his 75th international century. Kohli kissed the locket of his necklace and looked skywards in a muted celebration.

Patel, who smashed four sixes and five fours in his belligerent 79, continued his red-hot form with the bat, registering his third half-century of the series.

The left-hander smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over and was looking good for a maiden test hundred before he dragged a Mitchell Starc delivery on to his stumps.

Patel's 162-run stand for the sixth wicket with Kohli was the highest in the Indian innings.

With Ravichandran Ashwin and Umesh Yadav falling in quick succession and Iyer not available to bat, Kohli realised he was running out of partners and tried to accelerate.

He became the last Indian wicket to fall, holing out to Marnus Labuschagne at long-on to depart after a 364-ball knock, which included 15 fours.

Lyon alone bowled 65 of Australia's 178.5 overs on a flat track where bowlers found little assistance.

Kohli's 28th Test hundred helped India amass 571 in response to Australia's first innings score of 480.

AS IT HAPPENED

With a lead of 91 runs, India had a go at Australia in the six overs before stumps but visitors managed to keep all wickets intact.

With a lead of 88 at close, India will have to go for the jugular on day five on a track where there is finally some turn and bounce on offer but not something that batters can't tackle.

A draw still looks the most likely result but if any team wins the Test from here, it will be India, who would then go on to win the series 3-1 and directly qualify for the World Test Championship final, without having to wait on the fate of Sri Lanka's Test series versus New Zealand.

For the 15,000 odd people present at Motera, it was a Sunday to remember as Kohli guided Nathan Lyon towards mid-wicket to complete his first Test hundred since November 2019. The hundred, his 75th in international cricket, came off 241 balls.

The celebrations were muted as there was still some way to go before India would be in driver's seat and hence he didn't want to lose focus by getting elated. There was a smile of satisfaction and a now familiar kiss on his engagement ring.

It was an innings of different character from Kohli. Having had his troubles dealing with deliveries outside the off-stump, he traded caution in exchange of flair and hardly played those beastly cover drives till he reached his hundred.

Kohli did not hit a boundary till he got to the hundred. Kohli showed copious amount of patience on way to a gritty hundred before changing gears. But once he got the milestone he scored quickly alongside Axar.

Kohli ran 84 singles, 18 doubles and twice he took three runs, including once when he was batting in his 160s. By sheer volume of running between the wickets, he collected 126 of his 186 runs with 15 hits to the fence.

Shreyas Iyer couldn't turn up for batting due to recurring back pain and Kohli was the ninth and last Indian man to be dismissed after his 364 ball knock that spanned over 8 hours and 36 minutes. No one deserved those 14 runs more than him.

As Kohli dragged his tired body towards the pavilion, rival skipper Steve Smith and bowler Todd Murphy along with other Aussie players came to shake his hands and the crowd near dressing room gave a standing ovation.

Kohli did have some significant partnerships but no better than the 162 that he added for the sixth wicket with an ever- improving Axar Patel (79 off 113 balls).

Never had Kohli shown determination of this kind and a testimony to that was not being impatient for a boundary for 162 balls. In fact, in the first session, he couldn't add to his overnight five hits to the fence.

Kohli decided to complete the coveted ton in singles and doubles and then hit 10 boundaries in his next 86 runs.

The first expansive cover drive only came in his 140s off Cameron Green.

That the track was good for batting was evident from the fact that all partnerships for the first six wickets was worth more than 50 runs.

Australian bowlers though had a good morning session as India managed only 73 in the 32 overs that were sent down.

Kona Bharat (44, 88 balls), who has had a dreadful run with the bat, looked impressive as he hit three sixes in his innings but would curse himself for not getting a big one and cementing his place in the Indian team.

In the post lunch session, it was Bharat who attacked, pulled and hooked Cameron Green for a couple of sixes when he tried bouncing the batter from around the wicket.

His best shot was slog swept six off Nathan Lyon over cow corner but he would rue his luck after being out to a bat-pad catch at short-leg off Lyon's bowling.

Virat Kohli scored 186 as India ended their first innings at 571 in the fourth and final Test against Australia here on Sunday.

At stumps on the fourth day, Australia were three for no loss in their second essay with Matthew Kuhnemann (0 batting) and Travis Head (3 batting) seeing through their six overs in the final session.

Australia are behind by 88 runs.

Resuming the penultimate day on 289 for three, India rode on Kohli's first Test century in more than three years to get past the Australian first innings total of 480 in the final session.

Kohli, who was overnight 59, ran out of partners and got out for 186 in 364 balls (15x4) to give India a 91-run first innings lead.

Virat Kohli ended his agonising wait for a Test century with a painstaking 186 as India racked up 571 to claim a lead of 91 in the fourth and final Test against Australia on Sunday.

Scorecard

The hosts, who lead the series 2-1, strung together six 50-plus partnerships at the top to effectively put themselves in an unbeatable position heading into the final day of the contest.

Having conceded a handy first-innings lead, Australia finished day four on three for no loss.

The touring side sent nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann to open with Travis Head after in-form opener Usman Khawaja hurt his knee while fielding.

Kuhnemann, who survived 18 balls, was nearly caught on two occasions but Australia somehow saw off the final six overs without any damage.

Earlier, India lost Ravindra Jadeja (28) after resuming on 289-3 but Kohli and KS Bharat denied Australia another success in that slow-moving session.

Todd Murphy (3-113) broke Kohli's 64-run partnership with Jadeja, who chipped the ball to Khawaja at mid-on.

Kohli was happy to nudge the ball around, while Bharat hit Nathan Lyon for a six before putting his head down and accumulating runs without taking too many risks.

Promoted in the batting order as Shreyas Iyer did not bat because of back pain, Bharat accelerated after the lunch break, hitting Green for back-to-back sixes and following it with a four in a 21-run over.

Bharat fell to Lyon after making 44, but Kohli could not be denied his first Test hundred since November 2019.

The right-hander took a single off Lyon to bring up his 75th international century. Kohli kissed the locket of his necklace and looked skywards in a muted celebration.

Patel, who smashed four sixes and five fours in his belligerent 79, continued his red-hot form with the bat, registering his third half-century of the series.

The left-hander smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over and was looking good for a maiden test hundred before he dragged a Mitchell Starc delivery on to his stumps.

Patel's 162-run stand for the sixth wicket with Kohli was the highest in the Indian innings.

With Ravichandran Ashwin and Umesh Yadav falling in quick succession and Iyer not available to bat, Kohli realised he was running out of partners and tried to accelerate.

He became the last Indian wicket to fall, holing out to Marnus Labuschagne at long-on to depart after a 364-ball knock, which included 15 fours.

Lyon alone bowled 65 of Australia's 178.5 overs on a flat track where bowlers found little assistance.

India edged ahead of Australia on the fourth day of the Ahmedabad Test thanks to a superb knock from Virat Kohli on Sunday but the match itself seems to be heading towards a high-scoring draw at the Narendra Modi Stadium.

India took a 91-run lead after Virat Kohli's 186 which was preceded by Shubman Gill's 128 as the hosts posted 571 in their first innings on the penultimate day.

This came in reply to Australia's 480 which they scored over the first-two days of the fourth Test after Steve Smith won the toss and elected to bat first at Motera.

The Aussies ended the fourth day at 3 for no loss as openers Travis Head (3*) and Usman Khawaja (0*) survived six nervy overs before the close of play.

Virat Kohli ends long wait for Test hundred

But the day belonged to the former India captain, also known as King Kohli in our part of the world.

The 34-year-old ended a wait of over 3 years as he brought up his 28th Test hundred and first in the format since November 2019.

It was his 75th international century and 8th against the Aussies. Kohli also equalled retired legend Sunil Gavaskar's tally of 28 tons as he brought up triple figures for the 14th time in Test cricket in India.

His 364-ball knock lasted 520 minutes and included 15 fours. His wife Anushka Sharma later revealed on social media that Kohli was unwell during the knock.

""Playing through sickness with this compusure. Inspiring me always,"" Anushka Sharma captioned her Instagram story after Kohli's latest Test hundred.

Centurions Kohli, Gill put India ahead

Kohli was India's second centurion in the first innings after Shubman Gill, who scored 128 on Day 3.

They both were part of a 58-run partnership for the third wicket after which Kohli stitched three big stands with Ravindra Jadeja (28), KS Bharat (44) and Axar Patel worth 64, 84 and 162 runs, respectively.

Patel once again made an important contribution with the bat with 79 runs to take his overally tally to 264 from four Tests with one innings to go.

The all-rounder trails only Usman Khawaja (333) and Kohli (297) on the list of highest run-getters in this Border-Gavaskar series.

India lead the four-match series 2-1 and retained the trophy for the fourth time in succession after winning the Delhi Test. But a win in Ahmedabad seems unlikely due to the flat pitch and lack of time left in the game.

How India can qualify for WTC Final?

India need to win the series 3-1 to guarantee a place in the ICC World Test Championship final. A draw in Ahmedabad will mean that they will have to depend on the Test series result between New Zealand and Sri Lanka to know their fate.

If Sri Lanka stun hosts New Zealand 2-0 and India don't win the fourth Test then the islanders will qualify for the final. But if India draw against Australia and the Lankans don't sweep the series in New Zealand, then Rohit Sharma's team will go through.

Australia have already qualified for the WTC summit clash after winning the Indore Test. The WTC final will be played at The Oval in London from June 23 this year.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri':

The star batsman looked in mighty touch but his innings finally came to an end as he was caught in the deep by Marnus Labuschagne. With wickets falling on the other end, Kohli looked to accelerate the innings and a miscue off Murphy spelled the end of a near-perfect innings. The disappointment was clear on Kohli's face as he missed out on a major milestone but there was no dearth of adulation from the fans as they go up on their feet and Kohli received a standing ovation as he left the field.

The Australian players all rushed to congratulate Kohli for his innings after the dismissal and the star batsman even ended up sharing a special moment with Australia stand-in skipper Steve Smith.

It was a special innings for the former India skipper who last scored a century in 2019 and his last fifty also came around 14 months back. However, there were no jitters at all for Kohli during the fourth Test match as he dominated all Aussie bowlers and slammed a deserved ton in 241 balls.

The moment when he reached the milestones sparked wild celebrations at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. Appearing to tear up, he acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room before kissing the locket on his gold chain as he smiled and looked up to the sky. Even the Australian players acknowledged Kohli as they were seen clapping after Kohli reached triple figures.

The star batsman resumed on his overnight score of 59 after he got his first Test half-century since January 2022 on day three on a pitch favouring the batsmen. He stitched together solid partnerships with Shubman Gill, KS Bharat and Ravindra Jadeja to hand India a 91-run lead in the first innings.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Smith (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}]","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-03/26a46a0g_kohli-smith_625x300_12_March_23.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(800,400)",eng-8469535,0.05098039215686279,416320800,1,sports.ndtv.com,news,NDTVSports.com,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket Batting (cricket) Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019 Marnus Labuschagne Century (cricket) Wicket Captain (cricket) Ahmedabad Australia Steve Smith (cricketer) Ravindra Jadeja Cricket pitch Shubman Gill Cricket India,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,40,12,2023-03-12

Travis Head making all the runs, as he and makeshift opener Matthew Kuhnemann, negotiated the tricky six overs from Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami.

If Shubman Gill was the talk of the town with his sparkling 128 on Saturday, it was Kohli's turn to be in the spotlight on Sunday to break his drought of Test century which lasted 1025 days through his determined 364-ball stay at the crease, hitting 15 boundaries and enthralling a sizeable Sunday crowd.

He was also supported by a nice 44 from KS Bharat and an excellent 79 from Axar Patel. For Australia, Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy took three wickets each while Mitchell Starc and Matthew Kuhnemann took a scalp each.

After 3.3 overs into the start of final session, Axar got India in the lead by cutting Todd Murphy through backward point for four. When Cameron Green was brought back in the attack, Kohli was quick to unfurl a cover-drive to an outside off-stump delivery.

On the very next ball, which was angled into pads, Kohli shuffled across to flick through mid-wicket and go past 150. When Green bowled a high full toss, Kohli got a thick edge past keeper for four, before taking a brace of boundaries off Lyon - a delightful pull was followed by a drive through mid-off.

Axar reached his fifty in 95 balls with a single off Murphy and then attacked Matthew Kuhnemann with a big swipe over mid-wicket for six. He then moved across to sweep Murphy through mid-wicket for four, before slog-sweeping twice off Kuhnemann for sixes.

Axar's knock came to an end when he tried to drive off Mitchell Starc, but chopped on to his stumps. Lyon got his third wicket of the match when he had Ravichandran Ashwin slog-sweeping to deep mid-wicket. In the next over, Umesh Yadav was caught short of the crease at the non-striker's end by a direct hit from Peter Handscomb.

Kohli was dropped at 185 when Handscomb tried to take the catch with both hands while diving, but shelled the chance. In the next over, Murphy bowled outside off-stump and Kohli went for the slog-sweep, but holed out to deep mid-wicket, bringing an end to India's innings as Iyer was unavailable to bat due to lower back pain which needed scans.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Kuhnemann', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Matthew Kuhnemann'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shami', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Mohammed Shami'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_toss', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Full toss'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Crease (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Handscomb', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Peter Handscomb'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}]",https://gumlet.assettype.com/dtnext%2F2023-03%2F35fccc87-5c12-4b76-b14e-3ebef8329c35%2FSPORTS.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&enlarge=true,eng-8469535,0.09019607843137245,416320860,1,dtnext.in,news,DT next,Over (cricket) Matthew Kuhnemann Fielding (cricket) Australia national cricket team India national cricket team Mohammed Shami Ravindra Jadeja Travis Head Ravichandran Ashwin Stump (cricket) Innings Shubman Gill Test cricket Full toss Nathan Lyon Axar Patel Mitchell Starc Crease (cricket) Wicket Umesh Yadav Peter Handscomb Boundary (cricket) Cricket bat Bowling (cricket),India,IN,English,eng,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,41,12,2023-03-12

In what would've been his eighth double century, Kohli fell short of 14 runs when he went for slog sweep off Todd Murphy and Marnus Labuschagne took a good catch at deep mid-wicket.

With Kohli's dismissal Indian innings also came to an end on 571/9 as Shreyas Iyer did not come out to bat due to back pain.

The moment Kohli started walking out, Australian skipper Steve Smith went to Indian batter to congratulate him and show his respect on a wonderful knock. Murphy also did the same.

On the back of Kohli's 75th international ton and Shubman Gill's 128, India have taken an all important 91-run first innings lead over the visitors.

Australia safely negotiated six overs to reach 3/0 at close of play.

After Virat Kohli completed career's 28th Test ton on Sunday, March 12, wife Anushka Sharma posted an Instagram Story, while praising hubby for battling 'sickness' on way to a fabulous hundred. Not to forget, this was Kohli's first Test century in more than three years. His struggle came to an end with a fine hundred in Ahmedabad on Day 4 of the fourth Test. Anushka wrote on her Instagram: ""Playing through sickness with composure. Inspiring me always."" No one but Anushka knew that Kohli was in some sort of discomfort during the innings. By the looks of it, it never appeared he was in any trouble.

At the post-match press conference, Axar Patel was asked whether Kohli was battling any such 'sickness', to which he said, ""Don't think Virat had any sickness. Don't know. The way he ran between the wickets, it didn't look he was sick: Axar Patel to media after match."" That means even Axar, who batted with Kohli for such a long time, too did not know about Kohli being unwell.

When Virat had completed his century on Sunday, he dedicated it to wife Anushka, by kissing the wedding ring. He wears the wedding ring in a locket and kisses it every time he achieves a big landmark with the bat.

Kohli eventually got out on 186 which came off 364 deliveries that included 15 fours.

Kohli's epic knock helped India amass 571 in response to Australia's first innings score of 480.

With a lead of 91 runs, India had a go at Australia in the six overs before stumps but visitors managed to keep all wickets intact.

With a lead of 88 at close, India will have to go for the jugular on day five on a track where there is finally some turn and bounce on offer but not something that batters can't tackle.

A draw still looks the most likely result but if any team wins the Test from here, it will be India, who would then go on to win the series 3-1 and directly qualify for the World Test Championship final, without having to wait on the fate of Sri Lanka's Test series versus New Zealand.

For the 15,000 odd people present at Motera, it was a Sunday to remember as Kohli guided Nathan Lyon towards mid-wicket to complete his first Test hundred since November 2019. The hundred, his 75th in international cricket, came off 241 balls.

The celebrations were muted as there was still some way to go before India would be in driver's seat and hence he didn't want to lose focus by getting elated. There was a smile of satisfaction and a now familiar kiss on his engagement ring.

It was an innings of different character from Kohli. Having had his troubles dealing with deliveries outside the off-stump, he traded caution in exchange of flair and hardly played those beastly cover drives till he reached his hundred.

There were shades of Sachin Tendulkar's 241 at Sydney in 2004 in this innings of Kohli's, when one compares the sheer discipline of the two knocks.

Kohli showed copious amount of patience on way to a gritty hundred before changing gears.

A supremely fit athlete, Kohli ran 84 singles, 18 doubles and twice he took three runs, including once when he was batting in his 160s. By sheer volume of running between the wickets, he collected 126 of his 186 runs with 15 hits to the fence.

Wife Anushka Sharma put up an Instagram post which informed that Kohli showed this enormous composure despite being ""sick"".

It was pity that Shreyas Iyer couldn't turn up for batting due to recurring back pain and Kohli was the ninth and last Indian man to be dismissed after his 364 ball knock that spanned over 8 hours and 36 minutes. No one deserved those 14 runs more than him.

As he dragged his tired body towards the pavilion, rival skipper Steve Smith and bowler Todd Murphy along with other Aussie players came to shake his hands and the crowd near dressing room gave a standing ovation.

He did have some significant partnerships but no better than the 162 that he added for the sixth wicket with an ever- improving Axar Patel (79 off 113 balls).

Never had Kohli shown determination of this kind and a testimony to that was not being impatient for a boundary for 162 balls. In fact, in the first session, he couldn't add to his overnight five hits to the fence.

He decided to complete the coveted ton in singles and doubles and then hit 10 boundaries in his next 86 runs.

The first expansive cover drive only came in his 140s off Cameron Green.

That the track was good for batting was evident from the fact that all partnerships for the first six wickets was worth more than 50 runs.

Australian bowlers though had a good morning session as India managed only 73 in the 32 overs that were sent down.

Kona Bharat (44, 88 balls), who has had a dreadful run with the bat, looked impressive as he hit three sixes in his innings but would curse himself for not getting a big one and cementing his place in the Indian team.

In the post lunch session, it was Bharat who attacked, pulled and hooked Cameron Green for a couple of sixes when he tried bouncing the batter from around the wicket.

His best shot was slog swept six off Nathan Lyon over cow corner but he would rue his luck after being out to a bat-pad catch at short-leg off Lyon's bowling.",[],"[{'uri':

The innings also gave a glimpse of Sachin Tendulkar's epic 241 in Sydney.

Former Indian skipper Virat Kohli had a disarming smile at the end. He had just dispatched a Nathan Lyon delivery towards mid-wicket for a single. The 40-month wait is over, and Kohli has finally got his 28th Test hundred. There were no clenched fists, no imaginary uppercut like a pro boxer, and no giant leap in celebration. There wasn't any customary cuss word either.

Instead, there was just relief written all over his face. Kohli kissed his wedding ring tied to his necklace and acknowledged the crowd, unlike when he had completed a half-century. Test runs dried up during those 40 long months, and the average dipped to a lowly 25. There was criticism all around, and his legion of fans was kept waiting for the day when he would play a special knock to warm their hearts.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Boxing'}}]",https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01gvawwd1nvrs8y4fbfxr9dtm7/pti03-12-2023-000102b.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1058823529411765,416321160,1,newsable.asianetnews.com,news,Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd,Virat Kohli Australia Test cricket India Innings Cricket bat Sachin Tendulkar Captain (cricket) Sydney Ahmedabad Nathan Lyon Fielding (cricket) Boxing,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,46,12,2023-03-12

The hosts, who lead the series 2-1, strung together six 50-plus partnerships at the top to effectively put themselves in an unbeatable position heading into the final day of the conTest.

Having conceded a handy first-innings lead, Australia finished day four on three for no loss.

The touring side sent nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann to open with Travis Head after in-form opener Usman Khawaja hurt his knee while fielding.

Slow-moving session

Kuhnemann, who survived 18 balls, was nearly caught on two occasions but Australia somehow saw off the final six overs without any damage.

Earlier, India lost Ravindra Jadeja (28) after resuming on 289-3 but Kohli and KS Bharat denied Australia another success in that slow-moving session.

Todd Murphy (3-113) broke Kohli's 64-run partnership with Jadeja, who chipped the ball to Khawaja at mid-on.

Kohli was happy to nudge the ball around, while Bharat hit Nathan Lyon for a six before putting his head down and accumulating runs without taking too many risks.

Promoted in the batting order as Shreyas Iyer did not bat because of back pain, Bharat accelerated after the lunch break, hitting Green for back-to-back sixes and following it with a four in a 21-run over.

Bharat fell to Lyon after making 44, but Kohli could not be denied his first Test hundred since November 2019.

75th international century

The right-hander took a single off Lyon to bring up his 75th international century. Kohli kissed the locket of his necklace and looked skywards in a muted celebration.

Patel, who smashed four sixes and five fours in his belligerent 79, continued his red-hot form with the bat, registering his third half-century of the series.

The left-hander smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over and was looking good for a maiden Test hundred before he dragged a Mitchell Starc delivery on to his stumps.

Patel's 162-run stand for the sixth wicket with Kohli was the highest in the Indian innings.

""At first we were chasing their score. Once we went past, the talk was that if I get a bad ball, I would hit it,"" Patel said.

With Ravichandran Ashwin and Umesh Yadav falling in quick succession and Iyer not available to bat, Kohli realised he was running out of partners and tried to accelerate.

Little assistance

He became the last Indian wicket to fall, holing out to Marnus Labuschagne at long-on to depart after a 364-ball knock, which included 15 fours.

Lyon alone bowled 65 of Australia's 178.5 overs on a flat track where bowlers found little assistance.

""Once a batter is set, there isn't a lot in it for the bowlers,"" Patel said of the nature of the track at the Narendra Modi Stadium.

""There are a few odd balls that stayed low, maybe after pitching on the rough. But once you get set, you get an idea of the wicket and it gets easier."" India are chasing a victory in Ahmedabad to confirm their place in the final of the World Test Championship against Australia in June.","[{'uri': 'reuters@gulfnews.com', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwatchman_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nightwatchman (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting order (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}]",https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2023/03/12/Copy-of-232395-01-02-1678624288444_186d5cdeec4_medium.jpg,eng-8469535,0.02745098039215677,416321280,1,gulfnews.com,news,GULF NEWS,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia Ravindra Jadeja Usman Khawaja Boundary (cricket) Nightwatchman (cricket) Travis Head Cricket bat Ahmedabad Nathan Lyon Batting order (cricket) Fielding (cricket) Over (cricket) Shreyas Iyer Umesh Yadav Marnus Labuschagne Ravichandran Ashwin Narendra Modi Stadium Mitchell Starc ICC World Test Championship Stump (cricket) Innings Wicket Bowling (cricket) Batting (cricket),United-Arab-Emirates,AE,,,,,C19,C9,Asia,AS,Muslim,44.0,50.0,146.0,38.0,78.0,32.0,22.0,22.0,26.0,47.0,33.0,42.0,119.0,74.0,36.0,52.0,66.0,22.0,22.0,,,,,Arab League,AL,Arabic-speaking,Ara,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,48,12,2023-03-12

I have had the confidence to go after ones that I can hit, the talk in the 1st Test is what I am following and I am gaining a bit of information about my ability with the bat.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan has made an audacious prediction as he claimed India will win the fourth Test against Australia at Narendra Modi Stadium. Following Australia's mammoth 480 runs, the hosts had a valiant show with their batting with Virat Kohli leading the charge from the front. At the end of day four, Australia are trailing by 88 runs and the visitors will be determined to deny the Indians a chance of outright victory.

Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli and Axar Patel piled more misery on the Australian bowlers as they tormented them on what looked to be a good batting surface. Gill and Virat both slammed hundreds while in-form Axar hit his third Test half-century as India finished their first innings at 571.

Vaughan who is one of the most active former players on social media took to Twitter to predict India's victory. ""India to win this Test .. #INDvAUS""

Some people have agreed with Vaughan while some have differed with his opinion.

Earlier after Virat's 28th Test ton Vaughan also insisted he is hoping the see more centuries from the 34-year-old in the next few games. ""Good to see @imVkohli back scoring a Test ton ..

Kohli's epic knock helped India amass 571 in response to Australia's first innings score of 480.

With a lead of 91 runs, India had a go at Australia in the six overs before stumps but visitors managed to keep all wickets intact.

With a lead of 88 at close, India will have to go for the jugular on day five on a track where there is finally some turn and bounce on offer but not something that batters can't tackle.

A draw still looks the most likely result but if any team wins the Test from here, it will be India, who would then go on to win the series 3-1 and directly qualify for the World Test Championship final, without having to wait on the fate of Sri Lanka's Test series versus New Zealand.

For the 15,000 odd people present at Motera, it was a Sunday to remember as Kohli guided Nathan Lyon towards mid-wicket to complete his first Test hundred since November 2019. The hundred, his 75th in international cricket, came off 241 balls.

The celebrations were muted as there was still some way to go before India would be in driver's seat and hence he didn't want to lose focus by getting elated. There was a smile of satisfaction and a now familiar kiss on his engagement ring.

It was an innings of different character from Kohli. Having had his troubles dealing with deliveries outside the off-stump, he traded caution in exchange of flair and hardly played those beastly cover drives till he reached his hundred.

There were shades of Sachin Tendulkar's 241 at Sydney in 2004 in this innings of Kohli's, when one compares the sheer discipline of the two knocks.

Kohli showed copious amount of patience on way to a gritty hundred before changing gears.

A supremely fit athlete, Kohli ran 84 singles, 18 doubles and twice he took three runs, including once when he was batting in his 160s. By sheer volume of running between the wickets, he collected 126 of his 186 runs with 15 hits to the fence.

Wife Anushka Sharma put up an Instagram post which informed that Kohli showed this enormous composure despite being ""sick"".

It was pity that Shreyas Iyer couldn't turn up for batting due to recurring back pain and Kohli was the ninth and last Indian man to be dismissed after his 364 ball knock that spanned over 8 hours and 36 minutes. No one deserved those 14 runs more than him.

As he dragged his tired body towards the pavilion, rival skipper Steve Smith and bowler Todd Murphy along with other Aussie players came to shake his hands and the crowd near dressing room gave a standing ovation.

He did have some significant partnerships but no better than the 162 that he added for the sixth wicket with an ever- improving Axar Patel (79 off 113 balls).

Never had Kohli shown determination of this kind and a testimony to that was not being impatient for a boundary for 162 balls. In fact, in the first session, he couldn't add to his overnight five hits to the fence.

He decided to complete the coveted ton in singles and doubles and then hit 10 boundaries in his next 86 runs.

The first expansive cover drive only came in his 140s off Cameron Green.

That the track was good for batting was evident from the fact that all partnerships for the first six wickets was worth more than 50 runs.

Australian bowlers though had a good morning session as India managed only 73 in the 32 overs that were sent down.

Kona Bharat (44, 88 balls), who has had a dreadful run with the bat, looked impressive as he hit three sixes in his innings but would curse himself for not getting a big one and cementing his place in the Indian team.

In the post lunch session, it was Bharat who attacked, pulled and hooked Cameron Green for a couple of sixes when he tried bouncing the batter from around the wicket.

His best shot was slog swept six off Nathan Lyon over cow corner but he would rue his luck after being out to a bat-pad catch at short-leg off Lyon's bowling.",[],"[{'uri':

Delhi Police's Twitter handle got emotional on Sunday after India's star performer Virat Kohli finally ended a 40-month wait for his 28th Test hundred in Ahmedabad.

The police's social media team put out a witty tweet for 'Delhi boy' Kohli and also made an appeal to Gujarat Police.

Virat Kohli showcased his class once again as he ended his Test century drought with a gritty knock against Australia in the fourth and final match to put India in the driver's seat at the stumps on Day 4. Kohli scored 186 runs - his highest score against Australia in Test cricket as India took a crucial 91 runs lead after the first innings.

It was Kohli's second slowest century after his ton against England in the 2012/13 series coming off 289 balls, showing utmost discipline, determination and patience to play a long innings and get India into a strong position.

The tail didn't give much support to Kohli as in the end he had to go for big shots and he eventually got dismissed by Todd Murphy for 186. His 36-4 ball marathon knock was laced with 15 boundaries.

However, Axar Patel said that it did not seem like the centurion had any sickness judging by the way he moved between the wickets

India put up a massive score of 571 runs in their first inning against Australia in the fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Ahmedabad.

The home team bundled out the visitors for 480 runs and got off to chopping away at the total thanks to tons from former India captain Virat Kohli and opener Shubman Gill.

Kohli's wife Anushka Sharma took to social media to express her joy on her husband's latest landmark as she posted a picture with the caption ""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always"".

However, Axar Patel, who shared a 162-run stand with Kohli in Motera, said that it did not seem like the centurion had any sickness judging by the way he moved between the wickets.

Axar played a brilliant innings himself as his 79 off 113 deliveries brought up his third fifty in the home series against Australia after his 84-run knock in Nagpur and 74-run stand in New Delhi.

Gill's calculated 128 runs off 235 deliveries got India off to a good start before Kohli brought up his 75th international ton after a prolonged wait.

It marked the 34-year-old's first hundred in the longest format of the game since his three-digit score all the way back in the November of the year 2019.

He batted beautifully to make his way to the elusive mark and carried on from there to score 186 runs off his willow in an innings that spanned 364 deliveries.

There were also sizeable contributions from captain Rohit Sharma, veteran Test batsman Cheteshwar Pujara and wicketkeeper Srikar Bharath as the trio scored 35, 42 and 44 runs respectively. All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja also scored 28 runs as India navigated their way to the mammoth total.

Shreyas Iyer couldn't come to bat due to an injury and India finished their first innings of the game with a 91-run lead.

Travis Head and Matthew Kunhemann came out to bat for Australia in the second innings and finished Day 4 at three for no loss. The visitors trail the host by 88 runs.

India lead the four-match series 2-1 after their win in Nagpur and Delhi, but Australia pulled one back with their memorable win in Indore and sealed their berth in the final of the World Test Championship.

Former India captain Virat Kohli ended his 3.5 year drought of centuries in Tests against Australia on the Day 4 of the fourth Test match being played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Virat scored his hundred off 241 balls and also achieved many records while batting on the Day 3 of the fourth match.

Virat Kohli also hit a half century in Tests after 14 months as he last did it against South Africa in January 2022. Virat ended his innings at a score of 186 and he fell short off a double hundred. While all were talking about Virat 28th Test ton Australia captain Steve Smith was also seen applauding Kohli's hundred.

Virat Kohli and Steve Smith are considered to be one of the greatest batsmen in the world and we have also seen moments between the two players in the past wherein they were seen praising each other's performances.

Virat Kohli won the ICC 'Spirit of Cricket' award when he stopped the fans from 'booing' Steve Smith during the India vs Australia encounter of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2019.

If we come back to the match, then Virat Kohli also broke many records during the match. Virat while batting on Day 3 became the third fastest Indian to score 4000 Test runs on Indian soil. The former captain achieved the feat in 77 innings. Kohli also broke West Indies legend Brian Lara's record and became the second batsman in the world to score most International runs vs Australia. The 34 year old India batsman has a personal best of 169 which he played in 2014.

Coming back to the status of the fourth Test between India and Australia, Team India's first innings ended at a score of 571 with Virat Kohli being the top scorer at 186. Virat was the last to fall as Shreyas Iyer didn't come out to bat due to his injury issue.

Shubman Gill also slammed a hundred while batting on Day 3 which was the second of his Test career. This was also Gill's first hundred in India.

Australia before this had won the toss and had elected to bat first on a batting friendly Ahmedabad pitch. Usman Khawaja and Cameron Green were the star of the Australia batting as they together stitched a 208 run partnership. This partnership was the highest partnership by any pair for any wicket in the four match series.

Usman Khawaja on this occasion hit a 422 ball 180 and didn't face any difficulty facing the Indian bowlers. Cameron Green also notched his first Test century and played a 114-run knock off 170 balls. Australia managed to grab a total of 480 in their first innings.

R Ashwin wrapped up the Australia innings with figures of 6/91 and Mohammed Shami also chipped in two wickets. Team India lead the four match series by 2-1 and also have retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

After Shubman Gill smashed a brilliant hundred on Day 3 of the Test, India's star batter Virat Kohli ended over three-year wait for a century in the longest format of the game, scoring an exceptional 186 for the side. Kohli looked set for a double century but a flurry of wickets in the lower-order eventually forced the batter's hand to adopt an aggressive approach; he was caught at deep midwicket while going for a six against Todd Murphy.

Following his innings, Kohli was lauded by fans and former cricketers alike, with India star's wife Anushka Sharma making a major revelation about Kohli on her official Instagram profile. Anushka, on her story, wrote that Kohli was ""sick"" as he took the field on Sunday. ""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always,"" Anushka wrote on her profile.

During the press conference after the day, India all-rounder Axar Patel - who scored a valiant 79 and forged a 162-run stand alongside Kohli - was asked whether Kohli was ill during his innings.

""In such hot weather, he forged a such a great partnership and ran so well. It was fun batting with him,"" Axar further said.

Kohli scored only five fours en route to his 28th Test century, indicating that he relied primarily on ones and twos throughout his stay at the crease. The India batter also registered his highest Test score against Australia but fell merely 14 runs short of a double ton, that would've made him the first Indian to register 200+ scores against all of 'SENA' countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia).",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anushka_Sharma', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Anushka Sharma'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'All-rounder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Crease (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'England cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/12/1600x900/PTI03-12-2023-000179A-0_1678626306866_1678626306866_1678626333045_1678626333045.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1137254901960785,416322900,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Innings Virat Kohli Anushka Sharma Test cricket India Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019 Century (cricket) Wicket Batting (cricket) India national cricket team Shubman Gill Umesh Yadav Axar Patel All-rounder Boundary (cricket) Crease (cricket) England cricket team South Africa New Zealand Australia,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,15,13,2023-03-12

Virat Kohli had a disarming smile at the end of it all. He had just dispatched a Nathan Lyon delivery towards mid-wicket for a single.

Scorecard

The 40-month wait is over and Kohli has finally got his 28th Test hundred.

There were no clenched fists, no imaginary upper-cut like a pro boxer, and no giant leap in celebration. There wasn't any customary cuss word either.

Instead, there was just relief written all over his face. Kohli kissed his wedding ring tied to his necklace and acknowledged the crowd, unlike when he had completed a half-century.

During those 40 long months, Test runs dried up and average dipped to a lowly 25. There was criticism all around and his legion of fans were kept waiting for the day when he would play a special knock to warm their hearts.

Great players have the knack of conquering the odds, and on Sunday Kohli crossed a major hurdle with the fighting spirit of a champion.

Kohli had to channelise his inner Muhammad Ali, who won the scrappy 12-round tactical battle against Joe Frazier in 1974.

It wasn't Kohli the fire-fighter who hit a spectacular straight six against Pakistan's Haris Rauf at the MCG during the T20 World Cup last year. It was the scrappy Kohli, who was only looking at the three-figure mark at any cost.

The Sydney discipline of Tendulkar

On Sunday, Kolhi looked less like himself and more like Sachin Tendulkar, the man who didn't hit a cover drive till he had scored 200 against the Brett Lee-led Australian attack at Sydney in 2004.

In terms of joy and spectacle that Kohli's centuries are meant to be, the one in Ahmedabad would come lower down the pecking order -- perhaps not even among his his top-20 Test hundreds.

A look at Kohli's wagon wheel till he completed his 100 would look eerily similar to Tendulkar's wagon wheel in 2004.

Kohli stopped reaching out for deliveries outside off-stump. The cover drive hardly came out of the closet and he was only willing to whip deliveries outside off-stump in the arc between square leg and deep mid-wicket.

Sample this little statistical nugget: Kohli hit the fifth boundary of his innings off the 89th delivery he faced, and the sixth boundary came off the 251st delivery.

There were 162 deliveries (27 overs) in the interim, including one full session between fourth day's morning session that he faced and didn't hit a single four.

From his individual score of 60 till he reached the century mark, there were only singles and doubles. It was arguably one of his slowest hundreds and came off 241 balls.

It wasn't as if he didn't play through the off-side but it was more close to the body and just trying to tap it for singles, save one off Matt Kuhnemann on the third evening, which he hit for a boundary.

Once the monkey was off his back, the customary Kohli panache was back and the boundaries flowed.

He stopped reaching for deliveries even when Mitchell Starc angled one across or when Cameron Green bowled in the fourth or fifth stump channel.

The first expansive cover drive came when he was on 145. Kohli reached out to a wide half-volley from Green to get a boundary through extra cover. The next delivery was a signature Kohli on-drive, which took him to 150. The celebrations were even more muted compared to when he had reached his hundred.

This time, he didn't even take off his helmet.

The testimony to Kohli's fitness was running a three with Axar Patel when he was in his 160s.

Motera, over the years, has seen some major milestones, with Sunil Gavaskar's 10,000th run and Kapil Dev's then world record 432nd Test wicket, being a few of them.

Kohli's knock on Sunday will certainly join that list.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Getty Images'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Sydney'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Boxing'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Frazier', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Joe Frazier'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haris_Rauf', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Haris Rauf'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Melbourne Cricket Ground'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket World Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Muhammad Ali'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motera', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Motera'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapil_Dev', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kapil Dev'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}]",https://im.rediff.com/cricket/2023/mar/12kohli-anu3.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1686274509803922,416323020,1,rediff.com,news,Rediff.com India Ltd.,Virat Kohli Sachin Tendulkar Test cricket Fielding (cricket) Getty Images Sydney Nathan Lyon Century (cricket) Innings Batting (cricket) Boxing Joe Frazier Haris Rauf South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21 Melbourne Cricket Ground Australia national cricket team Cricket World Cup Twenty20 Muhammad Ali Ahmedabad Motera Sunil Gavaskar Axar Patel Kapil Dev Mitchell Starc Over (cricket) Wicket Bowling (cricket),India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,17,13,2023-03-12

Virat Kohli scored a gritty century on Sunday to help India take control of the fourth and final Test in Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Kohli ended his century drought in the crucial clash for India in the context to seal a place in World Test Championship final. The batting maestro smacked 186 runs to help India take a crucial 91-run lead after the first innings.

Kohli showed great composure during his 364-ball marathon knock which was laced with 15 fours. It was also Kohli's highest score against Australia in Test.

The 34-year-old was dismissed at the fag end of the day by Todd Murphy as in the search of a big shot, Kohli launched the ball at deep-mid wicket where Marnus Labuschagne took an easy catch.

The fans inside the stadium gave Kohli a standing ovation while the Australian players including stand-in skipper Steve Smith congratulated him for the big knock.

Day 4 of the fourth Test completely belonged to Kohli as he ended his Test century drought in a productive afternoon session to bring India on the verge of taking the lead against Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium.

Kohli got his long-awaited hundred in 241 balls, his second slowest century after his ton against England in the 2012/13 series coming off 289 balls, showing utmost discipline, determination and patience to play a long innings and get India into a strong position.

Kohli showed the copious amount of patience on way to a gritty hundred before changing gears. A supremely fit athlete, Kohli ran 84 singles, 18 doubles and twice he took three runs, including once when he was batting in his 160s. of running between the wickets, he collected 126 of his 186 runs with 15 hits to the fence.

With a lead of 88 at close, India will have to go for the jugular on day five on a track where there is finally some turn and bounce on offer but not something that batters can't tackle.

However, India need something special from their bowlers on the final day of the match to get the result in their favour.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Marathon'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Smith (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_South_Africa_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'English cricket team in South Africa in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}]",https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/03/collage-maker-12-mar-2023-06-46-pm-9723.jpg,eng-8469535,0.3411764705882352,416323320,1,news18.com,news,News18,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Boundary (cricket) Marathon Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019 Border–Gavaskar Trophy ICC World Test Championship Innings Batting (cricket) Marnus Labuschagne Steve Smith (cricketer) Wicket Captain (cricket) Australia English cricket team in South Africa in 2019–20 Narendra Modi Stadium,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,22,13,2023-03-12

After being dismissed by spinner Todd Murphy, Virat was lauded by Steve on his way back to the pavilion. Steve shook his hand and patted the batter on his back.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) posted the picture on Twitter acknowledging Smith's gesture.

""Respect and admiration,"" said BCCI in their tweet.

Notably, both Smith and Kohli are part of the 'Fab Four' batters of this generation along with New Zealand's Kane Williamson and England's Joe Root.

Both batters have had a storied career in Test cricket as batters.

In 108 matches and 183 innings, Virat has scored 8.416 runs at an average of 48.93. He has scored 28 centuries and an equal number of half-centuries, with the best individual score of 254*.

On the other hand, Smith has represented Australia in 96 Tests, in which he has scored 8,782 runs at an average of 59.74. He has scored 30 centuries and 37 fifties in the format, with the best individual score of 239*.

With this century, Virat has finally hit centuries in all three formats after not being able to hit an international ton from November 2019 till September 8, 2022.

On September 8, 2022, during the Asia Cup 2022 match against Afghanistan, Virat ended his century drought of 1,021 days in international cricket as well. He had smashed 122* off 61 balls. This was also Virat's first ever century in T20I cricket. His last international ton before that had come in November 2019, in a Test match against Bangladesh.

He followed it by breaking his ODI century drought on December 10, 2022 during 3rd ODI against Bangladesh. He scored 113 in 91 balls to end his ODI ton drought of 1,116 days. Before it, his last ODI ton was against West Indies in August 2019.

The first half of 2022 was filled with struggle for Virat as he could score only 476 runs in 16 matches across 19 innings at an average of 25.05, with just four half-centuries.

But since Asia Cup, he seems to have rediscovered the touch that made him one of the most feared players in the sport. In 31 matches and 35 innings, he has scored 1,507 runs at an average of 55.81. He has scored five centuries and seven fifties since Asia Cup. His best individual score is 186 since the Asia Cup.

He emerged as a second highest run scorer in Asia Cup (276 runs) and the leading run-scorer in ICC T20 World Cup 2022 (296 runs)

Coming to the match against Australia, a marathon innings effort from star batter Virat and his 162-run partnership with Axar Patel helped India end the fourth day of the fourth and final Test against Australia with a lead of 88 runs in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

At the end of the final session on day 4, Australia was at 3/0, with Matt Kuhnemann (0*) and Travis Head (3*) unbeaten on the crease. Australia trail by 88 runs.

India was bundled out for 571 in their first innings.

Virat Kohli brought an end to his century drought in Test cricket, scoring his 75th international century and his 28th in Tests. This was his first century in Tests since November 2019. In his marathon effort, he scored 186 runs in 364 balls, consisting of 15 fours.

Shubman Gill also scored a century, smashing 128 runs in 235 balls. Axar (79), KS Bharat (44) and Cheteshwar Pujara (42) also played some important knocks, which helped India gain a 91-run lead over Australia.

Todd Murphy (3/113) and Nathan Lyon (3/151) were the pick of the bowlers for Australia. Mitchell Starc and Matt Kuhnemann got a wicket each. lead over Australia.

In their first innings, Australia posted 480 runs. Usman Khawaja (180) and Cameron Green (114) posted stunning centuries to help the Aussies gain a massive advantage earlier in the match.

Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers, taking 6/91 on a surface offering no help to spinners.

After all, it was the modern batting great's first test hundred since November 2019, when he used to be captain of the side as well.

Since that 136 in Kolkata against Bangladesh in what was the first ever day-night test in India, Kohli had gone 41 innings without a test hundred, with many wondering if the 34-year-old was past his prime.

Half a dozen test half-centuries in that lean period and centuries in other formats did little to address the concerns of his fans who have only high expectations from someone who now has 75 international hundreds, second only to compatriot Sachin Tendulkar's 100.

Kohli looked in good form in the second test against Australia in Delhi but ended his slump in Ahmedabad which presented the best batting conditions in the four-test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Kohli took 241 balls to bring up his 28th test hundred, making it among his slowest.

His painstaking 186 would not count among his best knocks either but it could not have come at a better time for him and he had to work hard to emerge from the slump in form.

Like so often in the past, Kohli did not race to his century but rather constructed it even if it meant running hard between wickets under a harsh Ahmedabad sun with temperatures hovering around 37 degrees Celsius.

Such was his discipline that Kohli went 161 balls without hitting a boundary, preferring to accumulate runs in a risk-free way.

""It was so hot out there and the way he ran between the wickets and built the partnership, it was really great,"" Axar Patel, Kohli's partner in a 162-run stand for the sixth wicket, told reporters.

Patel said Kohli also egged him on to go for a maiden test hundred.

""Once I got set, I was connecting everything that came into my radar. He was also giving me inputs - like once I got my fifty, I should bat long since there was still 22 overs left in the day.""

The only blemish in Kohli's 364-ball knock was towards the end when Peter Handscomb dropped him off Nathan Lyon when the batsman was on 185.

By then, Kohli was beginning to run out of partners with number five batsman Shreyas Iyer not available to bat because of back pain.

A tired-looking Kohli finally departed holing out to Marnus Labuschagne after eight-and-a-half hours of hard toil to salvage his reputation.

Kohli scored 186 runs, his 28th test hundred and his highest test score against Australia, as India finished with 571 (178.5 overs) runs in its first innings to take a lead of 91 runs over Australia's first-innings total of 480 runs.

At stumps, Matthew Kuhnemann and Travis Head (3 not out) negotiated six overs with Australia at 3-0 in its second innings, trailing by 88 runs.

First innings centurion Usman Khawaja did not open the innings after suffering a suspected knee injury while fielding with Kuhnemann a surprising choice to replace him. The night-watchman survived as Srikar Bharat missed a sharp catching chance in the penultimate over.

Kohli's last test hundred came against Bangladesh in November 2019.

Post lunch, Kohli got to his 75th international hundred off 241 balls, including five fours. He had faced 162 deliveries without hitting a boundary, and after reaching his milestone, started playing more attacking strokes. Overall, he hit 15 fours.

It was Kohli's 16th international hundred against Australia, and second slowest test hundred in terms of balls faced.

Srikar Bharat meanwhile scored 44 runs off 88 balls, including two fours and three sixes. He added 84 runs for the fifth wicket with Kohli, before falling to Nathan Lyon.

There was no respite for Australia though as India's highest scorer in this series, Axar Patel, stitched up another long partnership with Kohli.

India went to tea at 472-5, with Kohli-Patel adding 162 runs for the sixth wicket. The duo batted for 37.1 overs while chasing down the Australian lead.

The hosts were ahead by 75 runs by the time Patel got out after scoring 79 off 113 balls.

Kohli also picked up the slack and reached 150 off 313 balls, adding seven more fours since reaching his century.

Mitchell Starc (1-97) finally bowled Patel in the 173rd over, and the Indian lower order suffered a mini collapse thereafter.

Ravichandran Ashwin (7) holed out to midwicket off Lyon, while Umesh Yadav was run out without troubling the scorers.

Kohli was last man out, caught in the deep off Todd Murphy (3-113) with Shreyas Iyer failing to come out to bat owing to a lower-back issue. He reportedly went to a local hospital for scans and is being monitored by the Indian medical team.

Lyon finished with 3-151 from 65 overs, the most he has ever bowled for Australia in a single test innings.

In the morning session, starting from an overnight 289-3, India found the going tough with only 34 runs coming in the first hour of play and the loss of Ravindra Jadeja, who was dismissed for 28 (84 balls) playing an uncharacteristic shot off Murphy. Kohli and Srikar Bharat then added 53 runs by lunch.

On day one, Khawaja scored his 14th test hundred. His 180 runs, accompanied by Cameron Green's maiden test century (114) took Australia to 480 runs in its first innings on day two. Ravichandran Ashwin took 6-91.

By day three, Shubman Gill (128) scored his second test hundred to lead India's first innings' response on a sedate batting pitch.

India has a 2-1 lead in the four-match series. It had won the first two tests in Nagpur and Delhi, while Australia won the third in Indore.","[{'uri': 'associated_press@thehimalayantimes.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

This was his 75th international century and fans were waiting with bated breath for this moment to finally come and when it did, the internet was filled with congratulatory posts.

One post that caught everyone's attention on Twitter was from the Delhi Police handle which posted a quirky tweet lauding Kohli for his effort. The handle referred to Kohli as 'our Delhi boy' and asked the Gujarat police not to book the player for causing hurt to the guests (Australia).

https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js

""Dear @GujaratPolice, Don't book our Delhi boy #ViratKohli for voluntarily causing hurt to the guests. AUS-SOME, game @imVkohli!"" Delhi Police tweeted.

The tweet was accompanied by a photo of Kohli with the words, ""Bura na maano, Kohli hain""

Resuming his innings at 59 off 128 on Sunday, Kohli took his time to score the remaining 41 runs. Off 241 deliveries, only scoring five fours in what was a gritty knock in the first innings.

With the hosts having lost Ravindra Jadeja early in the first session on Sunday, Kohli stitched together 84-runs for the fifth wicket alongside KS Bharat (44 off 88) to put India closer to Australia's 480 in the first innings.

The 34-year-old, who notched his fifty on day three, had come in to bat when Australia broke the 113-run partnership between Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara and was at the non-striker's end when Gill got to his century at Motera.

With this century, Virat has finally hit centuries in all three formats after not being able to hit an international ton from November 2019 till September 8, 2022.

On September 8, 2022, during the Asia Cup 2022 match against Afghanistan, Virat ended his century drought of 1,021 days in international cricket as well. He had smashed 122* off 61 balls. His last international ton before that had come in November 2019, in a Test match against Bangladesh.

He followed it by breaking his ODI century drought on December 10 2022 during 3rd ODI against Bangladesh. He scored 113 in 91 balls to end his ODI ton drought of 1,116 days. Before it, his last ODI ton was against West Indies in August 2019.

The first half of 2022 was filled with struggle for Virat as he could score only 476 runs in 16 matches across 19 innings at an average of 25.05, with just four half-centuries.

But since Asia Cup, he seems to have rediscovered the touch that made him one of the most feared players in the sport. In 31 matches and 35 innings, he has scored 1,507 runs at an average of 55.81. He has scored five centuries and seven fifties since Asia Cup. His best individual score is 186 since the Asia Cup.

He emerged as a second highest run scorer in Asia Cup (276 runs) and the leading run-scorer in ICC T20 World Cup 2022 (296 runs)

Coming to the match against Australia, a marathon innings effort from star batter Virat and his 162-run partnership with Axar Patel helped India end the fourth day of the fourth and final Test against Australia with a lead of 88 runs in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

At the end of the final session on day 4, Australia was at 3/0, with Matt Kuhnemann (0*) and Travis Head (3*) unbeaten on the crease. Australia trail by 88 runs.

India was bundled out for 571 in their first innings.

Virat Kohli brought an end to his century drought in Test cricket, scoring his 75th international century and his 28th in Tests. This was his first century in Tests since November 2019. In his marathon effort, he scored 186 runs in 364 balls, consisting of 15 fours.

Shubman Gill also scored a century, smashing 128 runs in 235 balls. Axar (79), KS Bharat (44) and Cheteshwar Pujara (42) also played some important knocks, which helped India gain a 91-run lead over Australia.

Todd Murphy (3/113) and Nathan Lyon (3/151) were the pick of the bowlers for Australia. Mitchell Starc and Matt Kuhnemann got a wicket each. lead over Australia.

In their first innings, Australia posted 480 runs. Usman Khawaja (180) and Cameron Green (114) posted stunning centuries to help the Aussies gain a massive advantage earlier in the match.

Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers, taking 6/91 on a surface offering no help to spinners.

Ahmedabad, Mar 12 (UNI) Star India batsman Virat Kohli's 28th Test put India in command as the hosts gained a 91-run first innings lead against Australia on Day 4 of the fourth Test of Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Narendra Modi Stadium here on Sunday.

Kohli ended his Test century drought by slamming 186 runs. He had last scored a Test century on 22 November 2019 in a day-night Test against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens.

The former India captain sent the Australian bowlers on a leather hunt for almost two days in his 241-ball knock. Around him, the Indian innings revolved, and his innings ended trying to up the ante as he ran out of partners nearing a double ton. He was out caught at deep midwicket by Marnus Labuschagne off Todd Murphy who claimed three wickets for 113 runs in 45.5 overs.

Prior to this, Kohli weaved six fifty-run partnerships for India in the quest to give a fitting reply to Australia's first innings total of 480 runs.

The first session saw Indian batsmen grind through, getting only 73 runs off 32 overs, losing the wicket of overnight batsman Ravindra Jadeja after he put on 64 runs for fourth wicket.

After being kept quiet for a long time by off-spinner Nathan Murphy, Jadeja lost his patience and tried to smash him over the park thrice in an over. He succeeded to get the first ball over the fence, but miss-hit the third straight into the hands of Usman Khawaja at mid-on for 28.

Kohli carried on with his grinding work even as wicketkeeper-batsman Srikar Bharat, who came in instead of Shreyas Iyer, gave him good company. Iyer was taken for scans following complaints of pain in the lower back.

Both Bharat and Kohli sewed a sedate 84 runs stand for fifth wicket, but not before the wicketkeeper-batsman had slogswept Nathan Lyon for a six. In contrast to this, the post-tea session saw Bharat pulling Cameron Green for back-to-back sixes before cutting him for a boundary, fleecing 21 runs in the over.

Kohli reached his coveted century by flicking Lyon through midwicket, but soon Bharat fell short of his maiden Test fifty by six runs as he was prized out by the same bowler who had him caught at short leg.

But Australia's joy was short-lived, for Kohli was joined by Axar Patel, who probably is the best batsman of the series. He did not waste time and got runs quickly to see India take the lead. The local star cracked 4 sixes and 5 boundaries, which galvanised a patient Kohli to cut loose.

The duo stitched 162 in just 216 balls to drive India to a position of comfort. Axar's dismissal however triggered a quick collapse. He chopped Mitchell Starc on to his stumps.

Ravichandran Ashwin was caught by Matthew Kuhnemann on a slog sweep and Umesh Yadav was run out, going for the second run. Kohli also fell for a big hit after he was left with only one partner with Iyer still unavailable.

Australia survived a tricky six overs period. Kuhnemann, who came in after first innings centurion Usman Khawaja had been off the field for jarring his knee, was dropped by Bharat off Ashwin. But the makeshift opener and Travis Head managed to see it through to the final day.

Ninety-one lead is a decent lead, but isn't good enough to put pressure on Australia because the pitch has not cracked up for the spinners to make inroads. In that case, Indian bowlers have to skillfully bowl out Australia to register their third victory of the series.

Brief Scores: Australia 480 (Usman Khawaja 180, Cameron Green 114; R Ashwin 6-91) and 3/0 trail India 571 (Virat Kohli 186, Shubman Gill 128, Axar Patel 79; Todd Murphy 3-113) by 88 runs.

It was a special knock for Kohli as it was his first century in the format after a gap of more than three years. After reaching the milestone, Kohli dedicated his knock to his wife Anushka Sharma by kissing the wedding ring on his gold chain.

Taking to Instagram, Anushka shared a heartfelt post for Kohli, and revealed that the former India captain was ""playing through sickness"".

At stumps on the fourth day, Australia were three for no loss in their second essay with Matthew Kuhnemann (0 batting) and Travis Head (3 batting) seeing through their six overs in the final session.

The hosts finished their first innings on 571 to overhaul Australia's 480 and get a first-innings lead of 91 on another run-filled day four at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.

Kohli was the last man out after he fell to Todd Murphy in the final session of play as India lost their ninth wicket and Shreyas Iyer did not bat due to back pain.

His wife, Bollywood actor Anushka Sharma, took to social media after the end of day's play to say the former captain was ""playing through sickness"" during his epic knock.

Australia reached three for no loss at stumps with Travis Head getting the runs while alongside nightwatchman Matthew Kuhnemann.

The left-handed Kuhnemann made a surprise entry to the crease after opener Usman Khawaja, who hit 180 in Australia's innings, did not come out to bat after getting hurt on the field.

Axar Patel, who shared a 162-run sixth-wicket partnership with Kohli, admitted that another Australia collapse like in the earlier Tests was unlikely, but that India would still try.

""It will not be like we will run through them like in the previous three games. We will have to work hard, keep patience and bowl on good areas,"" Axar said.

Kohli ruled the day with his 28th Test ton after he got a single off spinner Nathan Lyon in the second session to bring the house down as fans went wild with celebration.

Kohli, who now has 75 international tons across three international formats, kissed his locket before looking up to the sky.

Smash and grind

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Saturday since January 2022, the landmark came after a patient innings of 241 balls.

""He's a class player and he didn't give us a chance really,"" Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey said of the star batsman.

""We knew it was going to be tough bowling to Virat. We were able to contain him as much as we could and try to take wickets around him.""

Kohli then hit a flurry of fours after reaching his hundred and along with an attacking Axar, who made 79.

Khawaja attempted to catch an Axar six at the boundary but could not stay inside the rope, hurting his foot in the process and limping off the field.

It was termed as ""lower leg soreness"" by a team spokesperson and it was unclear if the batsman would play on the fifth day.

Kohli got past 150 after tea and Axar reached his third half-century of the series to wear down the opposition bowlers on a pitch vastly different from the rank turners in the previous three matches.

Spinners Lyon and Murphy bowled 110.5 overs between to get three wickets each on another day of hard grind for the bowlers.

Axar went into fifth gear after his fifty as he slogged and smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over before being bowled off an inside edge by Mitchell Starc.

Kohli lost his overnight partner Ravindra Jadeja for 28 in the morning session and Srikar Bharat fell in the afternoon after the wicketkeeper-batsman hit 44 in an 84-run partnership with the former captain.

Legendary Indian opener Virender Sehwag, with whom Sachin Tendulkar opened the batting for years, congratulated Virat, saying that ""class is permanent"".

Indian pace legend Jhulan Goswami also congratulated Virat for his ""iconic innings"".

Former Indian pacer Venkatesh Prasad also lauded this ""special innings from a special player"" and called his comeback to form an ""inspiration"".

Australian veteran opener also lauded Virat's innings on Instagram, warning to not "" write off champions"".

Pakistan's former wicketkeeper-batter also lauded Virat's ton, saying that ""a long wait is finally over.""

With this century, Virat has finally hit centuries in all three formats after not being able to hit an international ton from November 2019 till September 8, 2022.

On September 8, 2022, during the Asia Cup 2022 match against Afghanistan, Virat ended his century drought of 1,021 days in international cricket as well. He had smashed 122* off 61 balls. His last international ton before that had come in November 2019, in a Test match against Bangladesh.

He followed it by breaking his ODI century drought on December 10 2022 during 3rd ODI against Bangladesh. He scored 113 in 91 balls to end his ODI ton drought of 1,116 days. Before it, his last ODI ton was against West Indies in August 2019.

The first half of 2022 was filled with struggle for Virat as he could score only 476 runs in 16 matches across 19 innings at an average of 25.05, with just four half-centuries.

But since Asia Cup, he seems to have rediscovered the touch that made him one of the most feared players in the sport. In 31 matches and 35 innings, he has scored 1,507 runs at an average of 55.81. He has scored five centuries and seven fifties since Asia Cup. His best individual score is 186 since the Asia Cup.

He emerged as a second highest run scorer in Asia Cup (276 runs) and the leading run-scorer in ICC T20 World Cup 2022 (296 runs)

Coming to the match against Australia, a marathon innings effort from star batter Virat and his 162-run partnership with Axar Patel helped India end the fourth day of the fourth and final Test against Australia with a lead of 88 runs in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

At the end of the final session on day 4, Australia was at 3/0, with Matt Kuhnemann (0*) and Travis Head (3*) unbeaten on the crease. Australia trail by 88 runs.

Virat Kohli brought an end to his century drought in Test cricket, scoring his 75th international century and his 28th in Tests. This was his first century in Tests since November 2019. In his marathon effort, he scored 186 runs in 364 balls, consisting of 15 fours.

Shubman Gill also scored a century, smashing 128 runs in 235 balls. Axar (79), KS Bharat (44) and Cheteshwar Pujara (42) also played some important knocks, which helped India gain a 91-run lead over Australia.

Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers, taking 6/91 on a surface offering no help to spinners.

The star batsman ended his long drought with the bat on day four of the fourth Test against Australia to power India's first innings reply in Ahmedabad.

Kohli finally fell to Todd Murphy's off spin in the final session after playing 364 deliveries in a marathon innings in front of a rapturous crowd at the world's biggest cricket stadium.

In an Instagram story posted after the superstar cricketer's 75th international ton, Anushka wrote: ""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always.""

Axar Patel, who shared a 162-run sixth-wicket stand with Kohli in India's 571 all out in response to 480 by Australia, said Kohli appeared to be anything but unwell.

""That (he was ill) I don't know, but the way he was running between the wickets, it didn't seem he was unwell,"" Axar told reporters.

""The way he got the partnership in this heat and ran between the wickets, it was good batting alongside him.""

Called ""King Kohli"" for his prolific run-making, the maestro racked up his 28th Test ton with a single off spinner Nathan Lyon in the second session to bring the house down in Ahmedabad.

Kohli went through an extended batting slump in 2021 and 2022, during which time he lost the Indian captaincy, one of the most high-pressure jobs in world sport.

Kohli, 34, had spoken about his mental health struggles during his dry phase, including how he had been ""snappy"" to Sharma, with whom he has a young daughter.

( Image Source : Getty Images )

While a few cricket experts and pundits were worried about the form of former India captain Virat Kohli heading into the Ahmedabad Test match, the star India batter made the best use of the excellent batting conditions on offer at the Narendra Modi Stadium to notch up his 28th Test match hundred. This was Kohli's first century in the purest form of the game in over 1200 days. However, it wasn't one of the most dominating knocks that Kohli has played in his career. He took his time and ran a lot of singles and doubles on his way to the landmark.

He got to his century off the 241st delivery that he faced with the help of just 5 boundaries. Thereafter, his innings looked a bit more fluent and the right-handed batter was closing in on a double hundred. But the injury to Shreyas Iyer and a couple of quick wickets meant he was running out of partners and had to take the onus on himself to either look for twos, hit boundaries and farm the strike.

It was in this passage of play when Australia captain Steve Smith made a unique field setting, placing all his fielders on the boundary. This meant that there was hardly any two or boundary on offer. When Kohli tried to get a two by playing it with soft hands on the on-side, Umesh Yadav got run out which might have also played on the minds of the batter when last man Mohammed Shami joined him at the 22 yards.

This led to Kohli trying to clear the fence and getting out after a superb innings of 186 balls off 364 deliveries. The picture of Smith's field setting to deny the batter a double century has gone viral on social media.

Talking about the match, the game seems to be heading towards a draw at Stumps on Day 4. Australia opted to bat first and scored 480 before Kohli and Shubman Gill's hundred helped India take a 91-run first innings lead. At the end of the play on Sunday, Australia are 3/0, triling by 88 runs with a maximum of 90 overs set to be bowled on the final day of the Test.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Carey_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Alex Carey (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shami', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mohammed Shami'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Smith (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Run out'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}]",https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2023/03/12/8d7821f38745dd8d69c004755015a9181678632000127625_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=1200&imheight=628,eng-8469535,0.1058823529411765,416328720,1,news.abplive.com,news,english,Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) Test cricket India Australia Narendra Modi Stadium Innings Ahmedabad Alex Carey (cricketer) Captain (cricket) Cricket Shreyas Iyer Wicket Umesh Yadav Mohammed Shami Steve Smith (cricketer) Century (cricket) Run out Over (cricket) Cricket bat Bowling (cricket) Shubman Gill,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,52,14,2023-03-12

Former India captain Virat Kohli's animated reaction to Axar Patel's gigantic six during the ongoing 4th Test match against Australia has gone viral on social media. The incident happened during the final session of the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

Axar Patel, a left-handed batsman, was batting with Kohli when he hit a massive six off the bowling of Matthew Kuhnemann. The ball sailed over to the stands, and Kohli, who was at the non-striker's end, couldn't control his excitement and acknowledged Axar's shot with a big smile on his face.

Kohli's reaction was captured on camera, and the video quickly spread on social media, with fans and cricket experts praising Kohli's passion and love for the game. Many fans also commented on how Kohli's energy and enthusiasm are infectious and can lift the team's morale.

Kohli and Axar forged a crucial partnership of 162 runs in the final session of the day to help India post a mammoth total of 571 runs. Both players scored 79 runs each to create a record sixth-wicket partnership for India in Tests against Australia. India finished their first innings with a lead of 91 runs.

Earlier in the day, Kohli scored his 28th Test century to end his drought in the longest format after a gap of more than three years. Kohli smashed 186 off 364 balls including 15 boundaries. This after Shubman Gill scored his second Test century on Day 3 of the match on Saturday.

With his century, Kohli broke multiple records in the longest format of the game. Kohli has now become India's highest run-scorer in World Test Championship history. The 34-year-old now has 1803 runs from 31 matches at an average of 36.79. Kohli also registered his highest individual score against Australia in Test cricket. He is now the highest run-scorer for India in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy and has amassed 297 runs from four matches at an average of 49.50. Earlier, Kohli equaled Sunil Gavaskar's record for the joint second-most tons by an Indian player against Australia, trailing only Sachin Tendulkar.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/fjvjkpe6ae9uoj11_1678631440.jpeg,eng-8469535,0.2549019607843137,416329080,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Axar Patel Virat Kohli Test cricket India Batting (cricket) Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019 Bowling (cricket) Captain (cricket) Border–Gavaskar Trophy Cricket Sunil Gavaskar ICC World Test Championship Innings Sachin Tendulkar Shubman Gill,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,58,14,2023-03-12

Sportzpics

Virat Kohli roared back to form on Sunday with a fine century during the fourth Test in Ahmedabad between India and Australia. That was his first Test ton since November 2019, and his 28 overall in the longest format.

Kohli amassed 186 runs off 364 balls, before being dismissed in the 179 over by Todd Murphy.

While Twitterati congratulated Kohli as he finally ended his century drought in Tests, the veteran batter's wife Anushka Sharma posted an Instagram story, that hinted on Kohli playing the knock through sickness.

""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always,"" the Bollywood actor wrote on her Instagram story.

However, Axar Patel, who shared a 162-run sixth-wicket stand with Kohli in India's 571 all out in response to 480 by Australia, said Kohli appeared to be anything but unwell.

""That (he was ill) I don't know, but the way he was running between the wickets, it didn't seem he was unwell,"" Axar told reporters.

""The way he got the partnership in this heat and ran between the wickets, it was good batting alongside him.""

""In such hot weather, he forged a such a great partnership and ran so well. It was fun batting with him,"" the all-rounder added.

Kohli was the last to depart, and India were all-out for 571 in reply to Australia's first innings total of 480. This meant that the hosts took a 91-run lead heading into Day five of the Test, and in their second innings, Australia were 3/0, with a surprise nightwatchman in No 11 Matt Kuhnemann opening with Travis Head.

With a 2-1 series lead, India have already retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, but need to win the fourth Test to directly qualify for the World Test Championship in June. Australia have already qualified for the marquee event in London, with a win in Indore in the third match of the series.

Virat Kohli came out to bat on Saturday's third day with just one over left before the tea break. He got to face four deliveries from Nathan Lyon and could have fallen to any of the last three. An inside edge off the second ball he faced fell short of short-leg, the second one went perilously past his outside edge and an edge off the third fell in front of slip.

Having been dismissed in bizarre fashion more than once during his long phase of struggle, Kohli needed the rub of the green to go his way. He had ended his drought of international centuries with his maiden T20I ton against Afghanistan in the UAE during the Asia Cup last September, but a Test hundred remained elusive.

The former skipper had nicely warmed up for the Australia Test series with two hundreds in three ODIs against the visiting Sri Lankans in January, but a combination of dodgy pitches and his own travails against the turning ball meant he stayed stuck on Test century No. 27, which came in November 2019 during the D/N Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata.

At least on two occasions in the ongoing series -- in New Delhi and Indore -- the much-anticipated big one from Kohli appeared just around the corner, thanks to the sheer quality of his batting, but fate had a familiar tale to narrate. He would fall against the run of play.

He wasn't to be denied on this day, though. Not when he was looking assured after those three balls, each of which appeared to have his wicket against them. Not when he had decided to swallow his ego and shun his swagger. Not when he was determined to play the most un-Kohliesque innings since his 295-ball 103 against England in Nagpur in 2012 on a similarly sluggish surface. And certainly not when three tons had been scored on the first three days of this Test as opposed to just one in the previous three Tests of the series. It was as if the stars had aligned for the moment.

The moment arrived on the last ball of the 139th over when Kohli worked Lyon past short leg - nice symmetry that -- to move to 100 (241b, 5x4) -- three years and three months after his 136 in November 2019.

Though the Australians tested his patience with a lid on the scoring rate, Kohli was resolute enough to play the waiting game. It was the game he needed to embrace as much for himself as for the team, for India were still not out of danger.

Even when KS Bharat, fresh at the crease, pulled off a couple of sixes, Kohli resisted the temptation. Overnight 59, he collected 29 runs in 92 balls in the first session. His first four of the day came off the 123rd ball he faced and 163 balls after his fifth, which came the previous day.

It was as much a battle of attrition as it was a game of chess. Australia and Kohli, long-time rivals, waited to see who blinked first. The Kohli of the not-too-distant-past might have, but not the 34-year-old senior statesman who has gone through more in the last three years than most would in an entire lifetime.

He resigned as T20I captain on the back of talks that he could be asked to quit as white-ball captain. Soon, he was removed as the skipper in the 50-over format and relinquished Test captaincy following a 1-2 series defeat against South Africa last January in a complete leadership transfer process.

Accustomed to his theatrics through the ubiquitous ""Kohli-cam"", it was unusual to see him standing alone on the ropes without the accompanying antics. Not for nothing do they say that cricket is a great leveler. Kohli's place as a modern-day great is secure but even the greats have to perform to justify their continuance within a team set-up.

Kohli finally has, with a century which may not rank as one of his best in terms of aesthetics or sheer dominance.

Indian cricketer Virat Kohli has ended a three-year wait for a century by scoring 186 runs in India's first innings in their fourth Test match against Australia.

The hosts finished their first innings on 571 to overhaul Australia's 480 and get a first-innings lead of 91 at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

Kohli was the last man out after he fell to Todd Murphy in the final session of play as India lost their ninth wicket and Shreyas Iyer did not bat due to back pain.

Australia reached three for no loss with Travis Head getting the runs while batting alongside nightwatchman Matthew Kuhnemann.

Kohli ruled the day with his 28th Test ton, which he reached with a single off spinner Nathan Lyon in the second session as fans went wild with celebration.

Appearing to tear up, the 34-year-old acknowledged the crowd and the dressing room before kissing the locket on his gold chain as he smiled and looked up to the sky.

The former India captain now has 75 international tons across three international formats.

Dubbed ""King Kohli"" by his fans, the player is one of cricket's biggest names. He admitted last year to mental health struggles as his magic with the bat deserted him. He also lost the Indian captaincy, one of the most high-pressure jobs in world sport.

""A 600-kilo gorilla is off his back. He will grow a couple of inches taller by this evening,"" shouted commentator and former India coach Ravi Shastri.

Australia's stand-in skipper Steve Smith applauded on the ground, and a placard in the crowd read ""Here to see King Kohli ruling in his kingdom"", as children in India shirts bowed in respect.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted: ""Good to see @imVkohli back scoring a Test ton .. Love watching him Bat .. Over 3 yrs since his last one .. My guess is a few might come along now"".

Kohli had a tough 2021 and 2022, failing to reach three figures in over 1,000 days.

He quit as Twenty20 skipper in late 2021 and in January 2022 was sacked from the one-day captaincy and gave up leading the Test side, too.

But he hit his first ton after 1,020 days in the Asia Cup T20 tournament in September last year and has not looked back since.

Kohli finished the T20 World Cup in Australia last year as the leading run scorer and then hit three ODI centuries including two - 113 and 166 not out - against Sri Lanka in January.

The New Delhi-born star is rated as one of the best batsmen of his generation in world cricket, with a Test average of over 48 in 108 matches since making his debut in 2011.

Kohli now stands fourth in the all-time Test century makers for India behind Sachin Tendulkar (51), Rahul Dravid (36) and Sunil Gavaskar (34).

Kohli had spoken about his mental health struggles during his dry phase, including how he had been ""snappy"" around his Bollywood actor wife Anushka Sharma, with whom he has a young daughter.

Pundits, among them former World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev, even suggested Kohli should be dropped during his lean phase last year.

The former top-ranked batsman revealed during the 2022 Asia Cup that only Mahendra Singh Dhoni sent him messages of support during a tough phase of mental struggle after quitting the Test captaincy.

When the match resumes on the fifth day, India will need a win to clinch the series and be sure of a berth in the World Test Championship final in June.",[],"[{'uri':

Virat Kohli took off his helmet, raised the bat and kissed the wedding ring dangling from a chain around his neck after he flicked a Nathan Lyon delivery for a single and reached his 28th Test century (186, 364b, 15x4) -- the first since November 23, 2019.

As the crowd chanted his name at the Narendra Modi Stadium throughout on Sunday, Kohli flexed his muscles to guide India to 571 for nine in the first innings.

So close to a double

Though he would be disappointed to have missed out on a double-century, by just 14 runs, after holing out to Marnus Labuschagne at deep mid-wicket off Todd Murphy, Kohli dominated the fourth day, putting India in firm control of the game.

It took the erstwhile India captain 1,205 days to reach a ton since scoring his last against Bangladesh in the pink-ball Test in Kolkata.

Coming into the series-deciding fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with scores of 12, 44, 20, 22 and 13, Kohli, who felt slightly feverish after the third day, put his head down, batted for 516 minutes and went on to break the century-jinx in 241 balls.

He forged a 162-run stand off just 216 balls with Axar Patel (79, 113b, 5x4, 4x6) for the seventh wicket to make sure the home side took the much-needed lead. Axar scored 84 and 74 in the first two Tests, and coming in at a time when Kohli needed a partnership, he complemented the batting ace with five fours and four sixes.

Kohli held fort, while Axar accelerated the strike, in an indication that the lead could extend up to 150 or 160. However, he dragged a Mitchell Starc delivery onto his stumps and soon after his dismissal, India lost R. Ashwin and Umesh Yadav in quick succession.

Resuming the day at 289 for three, India scored 73 runs for the loss of a wicket in the first session as Ravindra Jadeja chipped to Usman Khawaja at mid-on off Murphy after adding 64 with Kohli.

Bharat does his bit

Coming in for Shreyas Iyer, who complained of lower-back pain and did not bat, K.S. Bharat took time to settle, but as the day progressed, he rotated the strike with Kohli and also hit Cameron Green for successive sixes and cut him for four to bring up 21 runs in an over.

That paved the way for the 84-run stand before he fell short of a maiden Test fifty, caught at short-leg off Lyon. But with Kohli and Axar around, India did not lose the plot.

Australia had six overs before stumps and ended at three for no loss, trailing by 88 runs. Regular opener Khawaja jarred his knee while fielding, leading to Travis Head being joined by night-watchman Matthew Kuhnemann. The latter was dropped by Bharat off Ashwin.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}]",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/oh7p75/article66611652.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/VIS_9978.JPG,eng-8469535,0.0980392156862746,416330460,1,thehindu.com,news,The Hindu,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Marnus Labuschagne Nathan Lyon Narendra Modi Stadium Fielding (cricket) Innings Cricket bat Batting (cricket) Border–Gavaskar Trophy Axar Patel Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Boundary (cricket) Wicket Captain (cricket) Kolkata Umesh Yadav Ravindra Jadeja Travis Head Usman Khawaja Ravichandran Ashwin Mitchell Starc Stump (cricket) Australia national cricket team Over (cricket) Shreyas Iyer,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,21,15,2023-03-12

Kohli ended a long wait to reach three-figure mark in the longest format of the game, with his last century in the whites coming in November 2019 against Bangladesh. The star India batter fell short of his eighth double hundred after he was forced to go for a big hit, owing to a flurry of wickets in the lower order.

Following his innings, Kohli's wife Anushka Sharma made a major revelation on her official Instagram account, indicating that the batter was sick throughout his knock. ""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always,"" Anushka wrote on her profile.

While Axar Patel, who had stitched a 162-run stand with Kohli in the middle on Sunday, stated that the batter didn't seem under the weather, former India bowler Ajit Agarkar stated that Kohli might have fallen ill due to intense heat in Ahmedabad.

""One of the standout features of his career has been fitness, he works really hard. He spent over 8 hours batting in this heat, so you are bound to have some worry. But, if you have still carried on, it didn't feel like it. I don't think he missed any runs while running between wickets,"" Agarkar said on Star Sports.

""It's always been the case. All great players do that, they find the extra energy and his determination showed in this innings. He was determined to get the big runs and then you find the extra ounce of energy.""

Former Australia cricketer Matthew Hayden, meanwhile, hailed Kohli and stated that his innings brought India back in the game.

""When you think back to the start of the day, we were talking about how India were controlling this Test match. At that point, though, it wasn't. It took something really special. It took an all day batting effort. You can even see at the end when Indian batsmen, Virat Kohli and Axar Patel, they found it really hard to hit big sixes and fours. It wasn't that sort of a wicket. It required to construct an innings for a long period of time.

""That's exactly what Virat did. Facing ball after ball, some good partnership. The day belonged to Virat in a very unique way, calm and composed. Constructed at a time when India really needed it,"" Hayden said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Agarkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ajit Agarkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting order (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Matthew Hayden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Star Sports (Indian TV network)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/12/1600x900/PTI03-12-2023-000335A-0_1678635453134_1678635453134_1678635476611_1678635476611.jpg,eng-8469535,-0.1137254901960785,416332140,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Innings Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) India Ajit Agarkar Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Batting order (cricket) Australia national cricket team Wicket India national cricket team Test cricket Axar Patel Bowling (cricket) Ahmedabad Matthew Hayden Star Sports (Indian TV network) Boundary (cricket) Cricket,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,49,15,2023-03-12

A complete batter, his cover drives, on-drives and backfoot play can mesmerise the audience. The Sunday crowd at the Motera also came anticipating such scintillating strokeplay.

What they got to watch instead was a stubborn, ruthless version of the India No 4. They didn't have anything to complain though.

Playing with single-minded focus, Kohli dug deep to produce an innings of exemplary patience and control while battling cramp to end a century drought that had lasted more than three years and three months. His magnificent 186 on Day 4 of the final Test against Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium also titled the scales a bit in favour of the hosts.

It wasn't trademark Kohli in terms of aesthetic appeal or sheer dominance. His eighth century against Australia - and the highest - though was one of his most significant from a personal and team point of view. In reply to Australia's first innings 480, he helped India finish 91 runs ahead after pushing the score to 571 before being the last wicket to fall, ending a marathon 364-ball effort.

In the absence of Shreyas Iyer - he was taken for scans after lower back pain flared up again - KS Bharat (44) and Axar Patel (79) provided Kohli solid support to bat the visitors out of the game.

Getting a docile track is rare nowadays. After looking at the pitch here, Kohli must have sensed it was his best chance to get a big one. Coming into the game with scores of 12, 44, 20, 22 and 13 made on turning tracks, it was his last chance to make a mark on the series.

Kohli has gone through so much in the last three years he didn't need extra motivation. While there were no demons on the pitch, scoring was a grind in scorching heat. It was not a typically busy Kohli innings. With the game in balance, he was prepared to graft, look ugly. Kohli had scored his 27th hundred in his 141st Test innings. It took 42 innings before the 28th arrived.

Australia stand-in skipper Steve Smith dried up the runs with defensive field placements for a disciplined bowling attack. With a packed leg side field, the ploy was to entice Kohli to play inside out or go aerial, but he didn't blink.

Kohli didn't hit a four in the entre first session. Starting the day on 59, by lunch he had added just 29 runs off 92 balls to reach 88. The 41 needed to get to hundred were made without a boundary. It is his second slowest hundred, off 241 balls. His slowest was in Nagpur in 2012-13, off 289 balls, against England.

In fact, having hit his fifth four on Saturday evening, his next came after 162 balls. In terms of self-control and curbing his strokes, it could be compared to Sachin Tendulkar's epic double century in Sydney in 2003 when he didn't play the cover drive.

A couple of years ago, Kohli would have taken the risk, but he knew he couldn't in this innings. The stakes were very high.

A lot has changed from the time he was captain and had a larger-than-life image. The aura has diminished. He has gone through torrid times in the last three years. The form started slipping. The average dropped below 50, the benchmark for a great Test batter. He was slipping from the debate on the world's top four batters. After stepping down as T20 captain, he lost his one-day captaincy too. In search of form, he relinquished the Test captaincy as well.

Kohli is wiser for the experience and has mellowed. On reaching the hundred, there were no wild celebrations. Instead of the trademark jump and fist pump, he calmly removed the helmet, took out the chain from inside the shirt and kissed the wedding ring and accepted the applause for international century No 75. His wife, Anushka posted on social media that he had battled illness.

With the monkey off his back, it raises hopes that it will lead to a second wind like it did for Tendulkar post the 2007 World Cup. At 34, Kohli is younger and fitter.

LOWER-ORDER SUPPORT

The pressure was on India's lower-order after it became clear Iyer won't be able to bat. After Ravindra Jadeja holed out for 28, Bharat and Patel rose to the occasion, sharing partnerships of 84 and 162 respectively with Kohli. It is only the third time in Test cricket that each of the first six wickets have added at least 50 runs.

The batters showed far more intent in the middle session as they added 110 runs in 27 overs.

Off-spinner Nathan Lyon bowled his heart out but the Australia pacers were disappointing. Mitchel Starc was taken for runs every time he came on, ending with an economy rate of 4.40. Cameron Green was the most expensive (econ 5), going for 21 runs in one over when Bharat hit him for two sixes and a four off consecutive deliveries.

Opener Usman Khawaja suffered a knee injury while dropping Axar Patel on the boundary to concede a six. He couldn't open but Matthew Kunhemann joined Travis Head to see off six overs until stumps. The pressure will be on Australia to negotiate the first session on the last day make the game safe.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motera', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Motera'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

The first three matches of the series had yielded just one century -- a masterpiece (120) from Rohit Sharma in Nagpur. The same match saw Australia fold up for 91 in the second innings. In the next Test in Delhi, Australia once again imploded in the second innings before crashing to 113. India suffered a similar fate in Indore where they were packed off for 109 as spinners held sway over batsmen on turners for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

Ahmedabad pitch, however, couldn't have been any starker in its nature in comparison to the first three. The 22-yard piece of real estate has been so docile that four different batters have scored a century each on each of the four days of the fourth Test here at the Narendra Modi Cricket Stadium. After Usman Khawaja's classical 180, Cameron Green's awe-inspiring 114 (his maiden Test ton) and Shubman Gill's sight-for-the-sore-eyes 128, Virat Kohli, overnight 59, compiled a marathon 186 (516m, 364b, 15x4) that ensured India finished day four with an upper hand on Sunday.

The former skipper, who ended his three-year and three-month wait for a Test hundred, was a constant in three significant associations that helped India, overnight 289/3, declare their innings closed at 571/9 at the fall of Kohli with Shreyas Iyer unable to bat due to a stiff back.

Armed with a 91-run lead, the hosts attempted to grab a couple of Aussie wickets in their second hit but Travis Head (3 n.o.) and Matt Kuhnemann (0 n.o.), who opened in the absence of regular opener Khawaja who hurt himself while fielding on the boundary, survived six testing overs. It could well have been 3/1 but wicketkeeper Bharat couldn't bring his gloves down in time to pouch a healthy edge off Kuhnemann in the penultimate over of the innings by R Ashwin.

With the century-drought weighing heavily on his shoulders, Kohli appeared determined to end the long, frustrating wait at the first genuine opportunity in the series in terms of conditions as the pitch was misbehaving only mildly even towards the end of the penultimate day of the match. He had done all the hard work the previous night in reaching 59 - first half-century since his 79 against South Africa in Centurion in January 2022. The task now was to convert it into a first three-figure score in over three years.

Though the pitch itself posed not too many questions, Kohli's task was to conquer the inner demons, if any; survive the physically and mentally taxing conditions despite the sickness as revealed by his actor wife Anushka Sharma through a post on Instagram. He also had to stay patient and not try anything silly in the face of Australia's run-drying tactic. The 34-year-old passed all the tests to bring up his 28th Test hundred.

En route, he shared significant partnerships of 64, 84, 162 with Ravindra Jadeja (28), Bharat (44) and Axar Patel (79) respectively that helped India go past Australia's total. Though a win seems a distant possibility given the pitch hasn't deteriorated to their liking, India will look to make quick inroads and hope the Aussies disintegrate mentally.",[],"[{'uri':

From former players to ICC, cricket experts and fans, Kohli has been widely lauded for his 75th international ton. But Delhi Police found their own way to celebrate Indian batter's century that won hearts of cricket fans.

""Dear@GujaratPolice, Don't book our Delhi boy #ViratKohli for voluntarily causing hurt to the guests. AUS-SOME, game@imVkohli!,"" Delhi Police posted on Twitter.

Kohli smashed 186 to help India post a mammoth 571 and take a crucial 91-run first-innings lead against Australia on Day 4 of the fourth and final in Ahmedabad.

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Saturday since January 2022, the landmark came for Kohli after a patient innings of 241 balls.

Kohli smashed 186 off 364 balls including 15 boundaries.

The final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series between India and Australia is currently being played at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium. Australia scored 480 runs in the first innings, but India responded strongly, posting 289 runs for the loss of three wickets by the end of Day 3.

However, India suffered an early setback on the fourth day when star all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was dismissed by Todd Murphy, who had already gotten Jadeja out twice in the series. Jadeja, who is currently the top-ranked Test all-rounder, gave a simple catch to Usman Khawaja at mid-on.

Virat Kohli's reaction to Jadeja's dismissal went viral on social media. Kohli and Jadeja forged a 64-run partnership before Jadeja's dismissal. Kohli was seen in disbelief after Jadeja just gave away his wicket in India's first innings of the match.

Kohli went on to score his 28th Test century, which came after a gap of more than three years. Kohli smashed 186 off 364 balls including 15 boundaries before he was dismissed in the final session of the day. Thanks to Kohli's efforts with the bat, India posted 571 runs and ended their first innings with a 91-run lead.

Earlier, Kohli forged a crucial partnership with Axar Patel as the duo put on 162 runs for the sixth wicket. Axar was dismissed by Mitchell Starc towards the back end of the Indian innings. Kohli then attempted to build a partnership with Ravichandran Ashwin but the latter was removed by Nathan Lyon for 7 off 12 balls.

When Kohli ran out of batting partners, he tried to play some aggressive shots to help India reach the 600-run mark and score a double-century in the process. However, Kohli's brilliant innings was halted by Todd Murphy.

Australia are currently batting in their second innings and have scored 3/0 in 6 overs. Travis Head and Matthew Kuhnemann will resume batting for the visitors on Monday, the fifth and final day of the ongoing Test match. India will try and bowl the Aussies out for a low score tomorrow so that they can have a go at winning the Test.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'All-rounder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/ku46ylotiirff6aq_1678636531.jpeg,eng-8469535,-0.01960784313725494,416335980,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Ravindra Jadeja Innings Test cricket India All-rounder Australia national cricket team Wicket Border–Gavaskar Trophy Narendra Modi Stadium Virat Kohli Ahmedabad Usman Khawaja Fielding (cricket) Nathan Lyon Travis Head Ravichandran Ashwin Axar Patel Mitchell Starc Over (cricket) Cricket bat Batting (cricket),India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,12,53,16,2023-03-12

Virat Kohli, like he has done all innings, like he has done all series really, flicked the ball calmly towards square before jogging the single.

Forget a monkey being off his shoulder. On commentary, Ravi Shastri had said a 600kg gorilla was off his shoulder. The understated way Kohli celebrated his 28th Test 100, and first since November 2019, also revealed where he's at at this point in time. He removed his helmet, took out the necklace, kissed the wedding ring before raising his bat to acknowledge the chants of a sparse weekend crowd.

Even if the Ahmedabad surface was an ideal canvas for Kohli to paint freely, his first few balls didn't inspire confidence. Off his first, he almost jabbed a catch to short-leg. His second saw him beaten. On the third, a ball before tea, he almost gave a catch to first slip. Just after tea, Todd Murphy beat him on the outside edge. On a true wicket with almost no variation in bounce and (very) slow turn, Kohli was finding it difficult to get bat on ball.

Apart from that initial hiccup, this was an innings forged in determination, discipline and concentration. One of the very few times Kohli wasn't in the zone over the two days was when he slightly lost his cool following an incident with KS Bharat who was at the non-striker's end. Kohli wanted the single after flicking the ball to square leg but Bharat didn't respond. He took a few steps but retreated safely before shouting 'call,' at Bharat. That 89-run of the fifth wicket partnership between Bharat and Kohli was important for two reasons. It made the game safe from an Indian perspective. It also showed Kohli's continued evolution as a red-ball batter.

He completely cut out the off-side from his line of sight. Wary of the outside edge as well as the leg-before, the former captain had already made adjustments. He had put one of his marquee shots -- the cover-drive -- in his back pocket. He had also decided the safest shot against all spinners would be rolling his wrists gradually before pushing the delivery towards square on the leg-side.

While this innings was missing Kohli's usual artistic expressions, it will figure highly in terms of the method he decided to employ. He ran 67 singles or twos in the region between square leg and mid-wicket to the spinners. He completely cut out the offside as a scoring option -- the visitors contributed to this while sticking to a line that saw bowling to his pads with a 7-2 leg side field -- till the time he reached the three-figure mark.

On Saturday, when he brought up his first Test 50 in more than a year, he went against the turn to hit a boundary once; off Todd Murphy, he unfurled a trademark drive that found the gap. In the next over, off Mitchell Starc, he opened the face of the blade to divert it past the keeper. Just before drinks on the final session on Saturday, he punished Lyon by glancing him fine behind square on the off side. After an iffy start, this was a solid foundation. That was also his last boundary in almost 150 balls and 60 runs.

In time, one might compare this century to the one Sachin Tendulkar brought up in Sydney against the same opposition and it might hold some water. But this innings was also borne of necessity. With India still in arrears and doubts over Shreyas Iyer's fitness, he had to grind it out on a pitch where quick runs were the hardest thing to do apart from taking wickets.

For the first half of Sunday, he turned to a shot that's been profitable for him; the dab to the leg-side for a single. Coming into the Test, out of the 111 runs he had scored, 79 had come via the leg side, with all of them coming against the three spinners. That same theme repeated itself. Out of the 186 he made, 122 came on the leg side (97 against spinners).

After the 100, though, he was a different batter. The cover-drive made its presence felt, attacking shots were dime-a-dozen and the flicks and glances on the leg-side had a stamp of impudence to it. A couple of shots will form part of the highlights package. One Cameron Green delivery, pitched wide outside off stump, was thumped through cover. Off the next ball, that again landed outside off, he moved across before finding the gap through mid-wicket and mid-on. This was the Kohli that had defined much of his earlier years; a Kohli special to bring up 150.

After dealing in singles, there had been a clear change of gears. A gentle push with a straight bat off a Lyon delivery had the ball racing past mid off to another boundary. Eighty in his first 100 runs had come via singles, two, threes or overthrows. The next 86 before being dismissed saw him make 40 in boundaries along with fewer dot balls.

With one wicket remaining, Kohli perished while looking for quick runs. At 4.32 PM, he fell to Todd Murphy when looking to slog sweep him over mid-wicket. For nearly five hours, he was a monk. For the four hours after, he had become the monk who had rediscovered his Ferrari.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_side', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Leg side'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Tea'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Murphy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Todd Murphy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Helmet'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

The hosts finished their first innings on 571 to overhaul Australia's 480 and get a first-innings lead of 91 on another run-filled day four at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.

Kohli was the last man out after he fell to Todd Murphy in the final session of play as India lost their ninth wicket and Shreyas Iyer did not bat due to back pain.

His wife, Bollywood actor Anushka Sharma, took to social media after the end of day's play to say the former captain was ""playing through sickness"" during his epic knock.

Australia reached three for no loss at stumps with Travis Head getting the runs while alongside nightwatchman Matthew Kuhnemann.

The left-handed Kuhnemann made a surprise entry to the crease after opener Usman Khawaja, who hit 180 in Australia's innings, did not come out to bat after getting hurt on the field.

Axar Patel, who shared a 162-run sixth-wicket partnership with Kohli, admitted that another Australia collapse like in the earlier Tests was unlikely, but that India would still try.

""It will not be like we will run through them like in the previous three games. We will have to work hard, keep patience and bowl on good areas,"" Axar said.

Kohli ruled the day with his 28th Test ton after he got a single off spinner Nathan Lyon in the second session to bring the house down as fans went wild with celebration.

Kohli, who now has 75 international tons across three international formats, kissed his locket before looking up to the sky.

Smash and grind

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Saturday since January 2022, the landmark came after a patient innings of 241 balls.

""He's a class player and he didn't give us a chance really,"" Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey said of the star batsman.

""We knew it was going to be tough bowling to Virat. We were able to contain him as much as we could and try to take wickets around him.""

Kohli then hit a flurry of fours after reaching his hundred and along with an attacking Axar, who made 79.

Khawaja attempted to catch an Axar six at the boundary but could not stay inside the rope, hurting his foot in the process and limping off the field.

It was termed as ""lower leg soreness"" by a team spokesperson and it was unclear if the batsman would play on the fifth day.

Kohli got past 150 after tea and Axar reached his third half-century of the series to wear down the opposition bowlers on a pitch vastly different from the rank turners in the previous three matches.

Spinners Lyon and Murphy bowled 110.5 overs between to get three wickets each on another day of hard grind for the bowlers.

Axar went into fifth gear after his fifty as he slogged and smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over before being bowled off an inside edge by Mitchell Starc.

Kohli lost his overnight partner Ravindra Jadeja for 28 in the morning session and Srikar Bharat fell in the afternoon after the wicketkeeper-batsman hit 44 in an 84-run partnership with the former captain.

His end was sealed shut, and he built partnerships with every batsman who came. Ravindra Jadeja, compact on the third evening, was like a cat on a hot tin roof. Defending clumsily enough to bring the LBW into play, he charged the bowler, twice narrowly missing the mid-on fielder before holing out.""Three hours and 21 minutes"" or some figure to that effect would be a classic Vijay Amritraj line when describing a match point at Wimbledon. Irrespective of the players, the situation or the occasion, Amritraj would bring it down to the time the two players had been on court.

Similarly, it's been 24 matches, 42 innings, 1205 days, and 2633 balls for Virat Kohli to move from his 27th to 28th Test century. Against Bangladesh, in Kolkata, in 2019, Kohli last reached three figures in a Test match.

When he did so in Ahmedabad, taking India to a strong position in the final Test against Australia, Kohli did not leap into the air and flail his bat, expletives in tow. Rather, he quietly and calmly acknowledged the moment, removing his helmet, raising his bat, and fishing into his jersey to give his wedding ring, hanging on a chain, the gentlest of kisses.

To be fair, this was one of Kohli's more sedate hundreds. He had scored just five boundaries when he reached his century and had not hit one ball in the air. On the fourth day of the Test, India were not best positioned, still well behind Australia's first-innings 480. The news that Shreyas Iyer had to go away for scans to check on a recurring lower-back problem, did not help in any way.

But, Kohli was bossing this Test match. On a pitch where the bounce was largely true and the turn quite even off the pitch, you needed something special to dislodge Kohli.

The cornerstone of his innings was the whip. You did not quite hear the crack of an actual whip breaking the sound barrier, but the manner in which he stayed still in his crease, or moved ever so slightly to his right and took the ball from outside off stump and channelled it through midwicket was a thing of beauty.

For a Test that has moved slowly, in traditional Indian fashion, Kohli played his role to perfection. His end was sealed shut, and he built partnerships with every batsman who came. Ravindra Jadeja, compact on the third evening, was like a cat on a hot tin roof. Defending clumsily enough to bring the LBW into play, he charged the bowler, twice narrowly missing the mid-on fielder before holing out.

When KS Bharat went for 44, undone by a beauty from the tireless Nathan Lyon, India were still 87 behind. Then came the batsman of the series for India, Axar Patel.

Once India reached par, Axar launched, taking on the left-arm spin of Matt Kuhnemann, hitting him crisply into the stands over midwicket, using the angle and the turn to his advantage. When a maiden Test century looked ripe for the picking, Axar fell on 79.

With the tail for company, Kohli took his chances. Again, just as his dour play for the best part of his innings had been to the team's interest rather than his own, his attack came when it was needed. In the process, Kohli was the last man out, for a 364-ball 186, when there was a double-century for the taking.

Kohli was not just sublime with the bat, he read the match situation and played it to perfection, and was unselfish in the end.

With a lead of 91, a wicket or two in the dying light would have left India right on top. Even with that not happening, a fascinating final day beckons, with only one team in with a chance of winning",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Amritraj', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Vijay Amritraj'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Leg before wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Championships, Wimbledon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

Fearing that the daring among the frenzied crowd might jump over the fence to give Kohli a bearhug, the security staff, with their walkie-talkies held close to their mouths, stood in attention. Close to 45,000 had opted to spend their Sunday at the Narendra Modi Stadium with the hope that Kohli, unbeaten on 59 at stumps on Saturday, would score at least 41 more runs.

He took his time but Kohli did score those runs. In the day's second session, half-an-hour after lunch, on the second ball of Lyon's 53rd over, he reached his hundred. His unspectacular single to square to reach his much-awaited 28th Test hundred was followed by a quiet, but emotional, celebration. A younger Kohli would have burst his lungs, strained his nerves and cursed out loud on reaching a hundred after even the slightest of criticism. At 34, he has changed. Despite losing the captaincy, endlessly trolled during his long Test hundred drought, Kohli was restrained. He raised his hands half-way, flashed a warm smile and looked under his sweat-soaked shirt for the wedding ring hanging from the chain around his neck. He would seal the celebration with a kiss on the shining band.

The crowd that came to see a Kohli 100 almost got a double ton. While anchoring India to a commanding 571, and a first-innings lead of 91, he scored 186 from 364 balls. Running out of partners and India wanting to put pressure on Australia, the Kohli marathon knock ended with a tired heave to deep mid-wicket. Before walking up the stairs, he would raise the bat to the stands and start his slow climb up to the dressing room. It was a draining and satisfying day. He hasn't had such days recently.

In search of that elusive hundred, he had travelled the entire cricketing world -- New Zealand, Australia, England, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka -- and played 15 Tests at home but the highest he had scored was 82. Once perched at the top of the list of Test run-getters, the slump was making him slip from the podium. His average that was once in the mid-50s -- the prerequisite to be called an all-time Test great -- was now close to 48. Even his contemporaries -- Aussie Steve Smith and England's Joe Root -- had raced past him. Root had crossed 10,000, Kohli was trailing him by close to 1,500 runs. In the period when Kohli had his run-block, Root had hurriedly collected 13 centuries.

Of late, Kohli seems to have made peace with his demotion and cricket's glorious uncertainties. Late last year, he took a break from cricket where, according to him, for the first time in his life he didn't touch the bat. On his return, he spoke about his vulnerabilities and how he had become the victim of the hype around him. He said he had subconsciously started believing in the image the marketing team created for him.

Every pre-series promotional video would have him wearing his trademark scowl and staring at the rival captain. The broadcaster would also float a cartoon series on him. They would call it ""Super V"". It was about a boy with superpowers. In the world that Indian cricket created for Kohli, failing was not an option.

About his learning from the brief sabbatical, he said, ""I sat and thought... and then came to the realisation that I was kind of trying to fake my intensity a bit recently."" Being on international cricket's non-stop treadmill, the tiring effort to be intense and in-the-face had taken its toll. The break seemed to have worked. The first sign was in the World T20 game against Pakistan. In that game he would hit the match-winning hit over the boundary rope that had the gravitas to be called the second most-important six in the history of India-Pakistan rivalry.

Though he couldn't break India's ICC jinx and continued to struggle in Tests, he looked relaxed. There was a superstar former captain in the dressing room but there were no stories, or even gossip, of factional fights. Be it a call for a DRS or a fielding placement, Kohli could be seen advising Rohit Sharma. They would appear in BCCI.tv videos appreciating each other.

He has been friendly with the Australians too in this series. Kohli, these days, likes to chat up the wicket-keeper and close-in fielders while batting. Even when fielding in the slips, he jokes with the batsmen. The other day, Aussie batsman Marnus Labuschagne missed a Ravindra Jadeja ball that almost took the edge. He looked at Kohli, who showed how to leave the ball. Labuschagne would give a thumbs up, Kohli smiled back.

His batting today was a study in restraint. In the first session, though the pitch didn't have many rough spots, batting wasn't easy. Lyon, his long-time tormentor, kept beating him with the starighter one outside off. He would also make him lunge forward and cleverly pull the length back. The ball would break and beat the bat. But Kohli survived.

From the other end, the rookie spinner Todd Murphy would target his pads with a leg-side heavy 7-2 field. The gaps were tough to find, the boundary had extra fields, the run flow was a virtual trickle. Kohli, of old, might have lost patience. He might have tried that against-the-spin cover-drive. But not now. Today he took 113 balls to score those 41 runs and reach 100. When he was in the 90s, the Aussies teased him by keeping the straight boundaries unmanned, tempting him to take the challenge, hit a six and reach the hundred. Kohli didn't take the bait, he reached 100 with an easy single.

It can be argued that Kohli's 186 on Ahmedabad's dead track is not a true test of his form in red-ball cricket. Will he be able to handle James Anderson in England? Can he negotiate Lyon's wily off-spin on a crumbling pitch at Nagpur? Only time will tell if this hundred can trigger a second wind to Kohli's Test career. But for now, he has made an important point. Kohli, after being the totemic King Kohli for so long, has adjusted to the life of a commoner. No longer, the voice of the team, he has refused to silently fade away. The demons in his head haven't been able to impact his muscle memory. The Kohli story is far from over.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri':

Kohli scored 186 runs, his 28th Test hundred and his highest Test score against Australia, as India finished with 571 runs in its first innings to take a lead of 91 runs over Australia's first-innings total of 480 runs.

At stumps, Matthew Kuhnemann and Travis Head negotiated six overs with Australia at 3/0 in its second innings, trailing by 88 runs.

First innings centurion Usman Khawaja did not open the innings after suffering a suspected knee injury while fielding with Kuhnemann a surprising choice to replace him. The night-watchman survived as Srikar Bharat missed a sharp catching chance in the penultimate over.

Kohli's last Test hundred came against Bangladesh in November 2019.

Post lunch, Kohli got to his 75th international hundred off 241 balls, including five fours. He had faced 162 deliveries without hitting a boundary, and after reaching his milestone, started playing more attacking strokes. Overall, he hit 15 fours.

It was Kohli's 16th international hundred against Australia, and second slowest Test hundred in terms of balls faced.

Srikar Bharat meanwhile scored 44 runs off 88 balls, including two fours and three sixes. He added 84 runs for the fifth wicket with Kohli, before falling to Nathan Lyon.

There was no respite for Australia though as India's highest scorer in this series, Axar Patel, stitched up another long partnership with Kohli.

India went to tea at 472/5, with Kohli-Patel adding 162 runs for the sixth wicket. The duo batted for 37.1 overs while chasing down the Australian lead.

The hosts were ahead by 75 runs by the time Patel got out after scoring 79 off 113 balls.

Kohli also picked up the slack and reached 150 off 313 balls, adding seven more fours since reaching his century.

Mitchell Starc (1/97) finally bowled Patel in the 173rd over, and the Indian lower order suffered a mini collapse thereafter.

Ravichandran Ashwin (7) holed out to midwicket off Lyon, while Umesh Yadav was run out without troubling the scorers.

Kohli was last man out, caught in the deep off Todd Murphy (3/113) with Shreyas Iyer failing to come out to bat owing to a lower-back issue. He reportedly went to a local hospital for scans and is being monitored by the Indian medical team.

Lyon finished with 3/151 from 65 overs, the most he has ever bowled for Australia in a single Test innings.

In the morning session, starting from an overnight 289/3, India found the going tough with only 34 runs coming in the first hour of play and the loss of Ravindra Jadeja, who was dismissed for 28 playing an uncharacteristic shot off Murphy. Kohli and Bharat then added 53 runs by lunch.

On day one, Khawaja scored his 14th Test hundred. His 180 runs, accompanied by Cameron Green's maiden Test century (114) took Australia to 480 runs in its first innings on day two. Ashwin took 6/91.

By day three, Shubman Gill (128) scored his second Test hundred to lead India's first innings' response on a sedate batting pitch.

India has a 2-1 lead in the four-match series. It had won the first two Tests in Nagpur and Delhi, while Australia won the third in Indore.

Kohli's epic knock helped India amass 571 in response to Australia's first innings score of 480.

With a lead of 91 runs, India had a go at Australia in the six overs before stumps but visitors managed to keep all wickets intact.

With a lead of 88 at close, India will have to go for the jugular on day five on a track where there is finally some turn and bounce on offer but not something that batters can't tackle.

A draw still looks the most likely result but if any team wins the Test from here, it will be India, who would then go on to win the series 3-1 and directly qualify for the World Test Championship final, without having to wait on the fate of Sri Lanka's Test series versus New Zealand.

For the 15,000 odd people present at Motera, it was a Sunday to remember as Kohli guided Nathan Lyon towards mid-wicket to complete his first Test hundred since November 2019. The hundred, his 75th in international cricket, came off 241 balls.

The celebrations were muted as there was still some way to go before India would be in driver's seat and hence he didn't want to lose focus by getting elated. There was a smile of satisfaction and a now familiar kiss on his engagement ring.

It was an innings of different character from Kohli. Having had his troubles dealing with deliveries outside the off-stump, he traded caution in exchange of flair and hardly played those beastly cover drives till he reached his hundred.

There were shades of Sachin Tendulkar's 241 at Sydney in 2004 in this innings of Kohli's, when one compares the sheer discipline of the two knocks.

Kohli showed copious amount of patience on way to a gritty hundred before changing gears.

A supremely fit athlete, Kohli ran 84 singles, 18 doubles and twice he took three runs, including once when he was batting in his 160s. By sheer volume of running between the wickets, he collected 126 of his 186 runs with 15 hits to the fence.

Wife Anushka Sharma put up an Instagram post which informed that Kohli showed this enormous composure despite being ""sick"".

It was pity that Shreyas Iyer couldn't turn up for batting due to recurring back pain and Kohli was the ninth and last Indian man to be dismissed after his 364 ball knock that spanned over 8 hours and 36 minutes. No one deserved those 14 runs more than him.

As he dragged his tired body towards the pavilion, rival skipper Steve Smith and bowler Todd Murphy along with other Aussie players came to shake his hands and the crowd near dressing room gave a standing ovation.

He did have some significant partnerships but no better than the 162 that he added for the sixth wicket with an ever- improving Axar Patel (79 off 113 balls).

Never had Kohli shown determination of this kind and a testimony to that was not being impatient for a boundary for 162 balls. In fact, in the first session, he couldn't add to his overnight five hits to the fence.

He decided to complete the coveted ton in singles and doubles and then hit 10 boundaries in his next 86 runs.

The first expansive cover drive only came in his 140s off Cameron Green.

That the track was good for batting was evident from the fact that all partnerships for the first six wickets was worth more than 50 runs.

Australian bowlers though had a good morning session as India managed only 73 in the 32 overs that were sent down.

Kona Bharat (44, 88 balls), who has had a dreadful run with the bat, looked impressive as he hit three sixes in his innings but would curse himself for not getting a big one and cementing his place in the Indian team.

In the post lunch session, it was Bharat who attacked, pulled and hooked Cameron Green for a couple of sixes when he tried bouncing the batter from around the wicket.","[{'uri':

Kohli made a magnificent 186 from 364 balls while Axar Patel blasted five fours and four sixes in a blazing 79 to hand India a first-innings lead of 91 after posting 50-plus partnerships for each of the first six wickets of the innings. It could have been more but Shreyas Iyer was unable to bat or take the field on day four due to lower back pain. He left the venue early in the day to have scans.

Australia suffered an injury of their own on a day where their bowlers' figures were badly bruised as they failed to make inroads, or even create chances, on an unhelpful surface. Usman Khawaja hurt his left leg while attempting to take a catch on the rope just after drinks in the middle session. He landed awkwardly and limped from the field shortly after with Australia's team physio. Details of his injury were not confirmed but he did not return and did not bat late in the day with Matt Kuhnemann opening as a nightwatcher. Khawaja has suffered a torn ACL and torn meniscus in his left knee in the past having had surgery to repair both tears.

Kuhnemann and Travis Head survived six overs for three runs as Australia remains 88 runs behind with three sessions of cricket remaining to either salvage a draw or somehow manufacture a result to level the series 2-2.Kohli, and it seems most of India, had been waiting the agonizing 1205 days for his 28th Test century. But he was willing to wait as long as was necessary to reach three figures against some disciplined Australian bowling in the first two hours of the day.

He was near faultless in reaching his 75th international century just after lunch. It was the second slowest of his Test career, off 241 deliveries, and featured just five boundaries in his first 100 runs and none in the first session of the morning.

The discipline and patience he showed was rewarded handsomely thereafter, as the burden of the three-year wait washed away and the dominant Kohli of old returned. He tore into Australia's two fast men Cameron Green and Mitchell Starc during attempted hostile spells with the reversing ball. He also became ever more expansive and extravagant against the two offspinners Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy, who he treated with the utmost respect in the first session.

He got wonderful support all the way through the day. His 168-run partnership with Axar was the fruit of his morning labour. The pair scored with incredible freedom compared to the grind pre-lunch. Australia's bowlers flagged in the afternoon sun. Kohli struck 10 classy boundaries in the afternoon unfurling some sublime drives on the up and some supreme pull shots off Lyon in particular, trusting the Ahmedabad bounce with cross-bat shots having fallen foul to them previously in the series on less trustful surfaces.

While Kohli got into line and prospered mostly through the leg side, Axar gave room to carve through the off. But he did mix in four brutal slog sweeps, three that landed in the stands and one that bounced into the fence at warp speed. Axar did have some luck against Lyon, edging him to slip where Smith couldn't hang onto an incredibly difficult one-handed chance high to his right. There were some other nervous moments defending Lyon but otherwise, it was smooth sailing.

The pair looked nailed on for a double-century stand and twin milestones with Kohli's 200 and Axar's maiden Test century in sight. But Axar fell by the sword, chopping Mitchell Starc onto the stumps trying to flay him on the up through cover.

Kohli ran out of partners as R Ashwin holed out in the deep and Umesh Yadav was run out by a brilliant direct hit from the deep from Peter Handscomb for a diamond duck trying to keep Kohli on strike.Kohli was dropped himself by Handscomb in the deep off Lyon on 185, a difficult chance diving low at long-on. It only cost one run as he holed out swinging for the fence next over.

Earlier, Kohli also shared half-century stands with Ravindra Jadeja and KS Bharat in the morning but India only managed 73 runs in the first session. Lyon and Murphy bowled superbly to keep a lid on the scoring, with Kohli really battling to break free from very disciplined lines and lengths although he was never threatened in defence. Jadeja eventually did smacking Murphy down the ground, but he holed out meekly to mid-on not long after.

Bharat slog-swept his second ball for six over wide long-on but battled to 25 from 70 at lunch. However, he hit the accelerator after lunch when Cameron Green tried to pepper him with short balls under instruction from his captain Steven Smith with a heavy legside field. After ducking a full over of short balls, he unfurled two pulls for a six and a cut for four in the following over.

Lyon knocked him over shortly after with turn and bounce. It was one of only three wickets he took for the innings across a marathon 65 overs. It is the most he has ever bowled in a Test innings and he deserved better reward than he got. Murphy also took three wickets from 45.5. They were Australia's best two bowlers by far as indicated by their workloads. Smith did not have as much faith in the other three with the two quicks lathered to all parts while Kuhnemann was nowhere near as effective on this surface as he had been in Indore.

The hosts finished their first innings on 571 to overhaul Australia's 480 and get a first-innings lead of 91 on another run-filled day four at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.

Kohli was the last man out after he fell to Todd Murphy in the final session of play as India lost their ninth wicket and Shreyas Iyer did not bat due to back pain.

Australia reached three for no loss at stumps with Travis Head getting the runs while alongside nightwatchman Matthew Kuhnemann.

The left-handed Kuhnemann made a surprise entry to the crease after opener Usman Khawaja, who hit 180 in Australia's innings, did not come out to bat after getting hurt on the field.

Kohli ruled the day with his 28th Test ton after he got a single off spinner Nathan Lyon in the second session to bring the house down as fans went wild with celebration.

Kohli, who now has 75 international tons across three international formats, kissed his locket before looking up to the sky.

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Saturday since January 2022, the landmark came after a patient innings of 241 balls.

Kohli then hit a flurry of fours after reaching his hundred and along with an attacking Axar Patel, who made 79, put on a marathon stand of 162 for the sixth wicket.

Khawaja attempted to catch an Axar six at the boundary but could not stay inside the rope, hurting his foot in the process and limping off the field.

Kohli got past 150 after tea and Axar raised his third half-century of the series to wear down the opposition bowlers on a pitch vastly different from the rank turners in the previous three matches.

Spinners Lyon and Murphy bowled 110.5 overs between to get three wickets each on another day of hard grind for the bowlers.

Axar went into fifth gear after his fifty as he slogged and smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over before being bowled off an inside edge by Mitchell Starc.

Kohli lost his overnight partner Ravindra Jadeja for 28 in the morning session and Srikar Bharat fell in the afternoon after the wicketkeeper-batsman hit 44 in an 84-run partnership with the former captain.

Iyer didn't come out to bat after he went for scans following complaints of lower back pain after the end of day three. Opener Shubman Gill led India's strong reply on Saturday with his 128 before he fell to Lyon, who returned with figures of 3-151 from 65 overs.

India need a win to clinch the series and be sure of a berth in the World Test Championship final in June.

He would ultimately finish with 186 helping India to a 91-run lead against Australia.

Australia have Travis Head and night watchman Matthew Kuhnemann in the crease as they look to steer the Test towards an inevitable draw. Even if India take all the Aussie wickets in this pitch, which in itself sounds like an unlikely task, they probably won't have enough time to chase down the target which the Aussies might set them.

With a draw, India's WTC final status will be up in the air and they'll be looking towards New Zealand, hoping and praying that they do not get whitewashed by Sri Lanka in their 2-match Test series.

Former India captain Virat Kohli ended a three-year-long wait for Test century, hammering 186 off 364 balls against Australia in fourth Test at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday (March 12). Kohli was applauded for his 28th Test century and 75th international ton all around the world but there was special admiration from the stand-in Australian skipper Steve Smith as well.

Kohli has always been part of the 'Fab Four' which included Smith, Kane Williamson and Joe Root - four of the best batters over the last decade in international cricket. There was mutual-admiration for Kohli and Smith and his heart-warming gestures on Day 4 of the fourth Test went viral on social media.

After being dismissed by spinner Todd Murphy, Kohli was applauded by Smith on his way back to the pavilion. Smith shook his hand and patted the batter on his back.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) posted the picture on Twitter acknowledging Smith's gesture. ""Respect and admiration,"" said BCCI in their tweet.

Both batters have had a legendary career in Test cricket as batters. In 108 matches and 183 innings, Kohli has scored 8,416 runs at an average of 48.93. He has scored 28 centuries and an equal number of half-centuries, with the best individual score of 254 not out.

On the other hand, Smith has represented Australia in 96 Tests, in which he has scored 8,782 runs at an average of 59.74. He has scored 30 centuries and 37 fifties in the format, with the best individual score of 239 not out.

With this century, Kohli has finally hit centuries in all three formats after not being able to hit an international ton from November 2019 till September 8, 2022. On September 8, 2022, during the Asia Cup 2022 match against Afghanistan, Virat ended his century drought of 1,021 days in international cricket as well.

He had smashed 122 not out off 61 balls. This was also Kohli's first ever century in T20I cricket. His last international ton before that had come in November 2019, in a Test match against Bangladesh. He followed it by breaking his ODI century drought on December 10, 2022 during 3rd ODI against Bangladesh.

He scored 113 in 91 balls to end his ODI ton drought of 1,116 days. Before it, his last ODI ton was against West Indies in August 2019.The first half of 2022 was filled with struggle for Virat as he could score only 476 runs in 16 matches across 19 innings at an average of 25.05, with just four half-centuries.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Joe Root'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Smith (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_Williamson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kane Williamson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Board of Control for Cricket in India'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'West Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}]",https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2023/03/13/1166434-smithkohli.jpg,eng-8469535,0.2941176470588236,416367360,1,zeenews.india.com,news,Zee News,Virat Kohli Captain (cricket) Test cricket Australia Joe Root Narendra Modi Stadium International cricket Steve Smith (cricketer) Kane Williamson Board of Control for Cricket in India Ahmedabad India Spin bowling Batting (cricket) Twitter West Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2020–21 Asia Cup Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Century (cricket) Innings One Day International Twenty20 International Cricket Afghanistan,India,IN,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,36,1,2023-03-13

Already has 75 tons, can get at least 50 more': Harbhajan's jaw-dropping 'Kohli-Tendulkar' prediction","Team India's star batter Virat Kohli ended over a three-year long wait for a century in Tests, as he smashed a brilliant 186 in the first innings of the fourth Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test on Sunday. Kohli's sublime knock took India to a mammoth score of 570/9 against Australia, giving the hosts an important 91-run lead in Ahmedabad; the visitors had put 480 in their first innings after opting to bat. This was Kohli's 28th Test century and 75th in international cricket, becoming the only second batter in the history of the game to reach the mark after the legendary Sachin Tendulkar.

Kohli has often been touted to break Tendulkar's run-scoring records; however, the talks around the same had died down a bit when the 34-year-old batter had hit a rough patch last year. Since scoring a century against Bangladesh in November 2019, Kohli had to wait for nearly three years to reach the three-figure mark again; it eventually came in the Asia Cup against Afghanistan in August last year, which kickstarted a 'second wind' of sorts in the Indian batter's career.

Since then, Kohli has scored four international centuries - three of them coming in ODIs - before he finally reached his ton in the whites. Justifiably, the comparisons with Tendulkar have begun again and there are rejuvenated hopes of Kohli finally eclipsing the India great's long-standing record of 100 centuries in international cricket. And interestingly, one of India's former cricketers - who spent a large part of his career sharing the dressing room with Tendulkar - has stated that Kohli will not only break the record, but also holds the potential to score fifty more centuries!

Former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh spoke in detail about Kohli's ton and made a major prediction about the Indian batter when asked whether he could break Tendulkar's incredible record.

""It's certainly possible. I think he can score more than that (100 centuries). Two things favour Virat here; his age, and his fitness. He's 34 but his fitness is that of a 24-year-old cricketer. He's way ahead in that aspect. He has already scored 75 centuries, he can score at least 50 more. He knows his game and he plays all formats,"" Harbhajan told Sports Tak.

""You might think I'm going overboard with this, but it is certainly possible. If anyone can do it, it's Virat Kohli. Rest all are far behind him. He knew he had to work on his fitness, because his batting abilities are god-gifted. I don't think he will stop from here. There are no technical faults, and even if they are, he works on them and rectifies them. Since his return (after break), he has already scored five centuries. This is pretty much a comeback for him,"" Harbhajan further stated.

The former off-spinner further stated that Indian batters needed a pitch like the one in Ahmedabad after bowler-friendly surfaces in the first three Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where matches ended within three days.

""It's nice that he (Kohli) got a chance to bat on a pitch that assists batters. Earlier, the games used to end in three days and bowlers ruled the roost. Virat, Rohit (Sharma), (Cheteshwar) Pujara also have the right to get pitches where they can score runs. A fifty on bowling-friendly surfaces is like a hundred, and they've done that,"" Harbhajan said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Harbhajan Singh'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Off spin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/12/1600x900/tendulkar_virat_1678641652478_1678641652717_1678641652717.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1764705882352942,416367960,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Innings Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) Test cricket India International cricket Sachin Tendulkar Border–Gavaskar Trophy Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Australia national cricket team Cricket bat Ahmedabad Harbhajan Singh Asia Cup Off spin One Day International Afghanistan Cricket pitch Cricket,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,46,1,2023-03-13

IND vs AUS Live Score and Latest Updates, 4th Test, Day 5: Beginning from an overnight score of 3/0, Australia trail by 88 runs against India on Day 5 of the ongoing fourth and final Test match, at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Matthew Kuhnemann (0*), Travis Head (3*) will resume batting for Australia on Day 5. The duo managed to keep their wicket in the final session of Day 5 in a rather nervous manner and will look to up the tempo in the first session of Day 5. In response to Australia's first innings score of 480, India posted 57I on Day 4, with Virat Kohli smacking 186 runs. The former captain had already bagged a half-century on Day 3, and then got his 28th Test century in the post-Lunch session of Day 4, and then brought up his 150 in the final session. He was the last wicket, getting dismissed by Todd Murphy for 186 off 364 balls. Meanwhile, Ravindra Jadeja, who resumed batting on Day 4, was dismissed by Murphy too in the first session, mustering only 28 runs. Nathan Lyon struck for Australia in the post-Lunch session to take the wicket of KS Bharat, who was nearing a half-century. Lyon also took the wicket of Umesh Yadav in the final session, with Mitchell Starc dismissing Axar Patel, who smacked 79 off 113 balls. India's qualification to the WTC final is hanging by a thread, and they need to win this match to confirm their berth. If they draw or lose, their fate rests on Sri Lanka, who need to win their remaining two games. India lead 2-1 in the ongoing series, a win for the Aussies will level the series, and a draw or defeat for the visitors will win the series for India.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_cricket_team_in_India_in_2018', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan cricket team in India in 2018'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Bharat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'K.

Watch | Cricket News,"Cricket fans around the world had a gala time after Virat Kohli brought up his 28th Test century during India's fourth Test against Australia, to guide the hosts to a dominating position on Day 4. The star batter reached the triple figures in the longest format after a hiatus of 3.5 years. Starting Day 3 at 289/3, Team India lost the wicket of Ravindra Jadeja after the all-rounder played a reckless shot and gave away his wicket to Todd Murphy. After his dismissal, wicketkeeper-batter KS Bharat was sent onto the crease as Shreyas Iyer had missed out on the match due to pain in his lower back. Bharat gave a strong support to Kohli and impressed everyone with his knock of 44 runs. However, there was a moment in the match when Kohli lost his cool at the youngster.

During the 134th over on Day 4, Kohli played a shot on Todd Murphy's ball and ran for a single. However, Bharat turned down Kohli's run call and the former skipper made his way back into the crease in the nick of time. This left Kohli fuming as he was seen screaming and giving a death stare to Bharat as his move would have caused Team India an important wicket.

Coming to the match, Kohli scored 186 as India ended their first innings at 571 in the series-deciding fourth and final Test against Australia in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Resuming the penultimate day on 289 for three, India rode on Kohli's first Test century in more than three years to get past the Australian total in the final session.

Kohli, who was overnight 59, ran out of partners and got out for 186 in 364 balls to give India a 91-run first innings lead. Injured Shreyas Iyer did come out to bat.

Watch | Cricket News","Axar Patel has been used as a third-choice spinner till now by skipper Rohit Sharma but the all-rounder impressed everyone with his batting prowess on Day 4 of the fourth Test match between India and Australia in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Axar slammed a valuable 79 to provide perfect support to Virat Kohli and guide India to a solid position in the match. One of the shots from Axar that was the highlight of the day's play was a massive six off Matthew Kuhnemann as he heaved the ball over the mid-wicket boundary. The shot left everyone stunned with Kohli breaking into a smile and Australia's stand-in skipper Steve Smith looking baffled by the power and distance of the shot.

Virat Kohli hit his first Test century in over three years with a towering 186 on Sunday to give India a sniff of what would be a stunning victory in the fourth Test against Australia.

The hosts finished their first innings on 571 to overhaul Australia's 480 and get a first-innings lead of 91 on another run-filled day four at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.

Kohli was the last man out after he fell to Todd Murphy in the final session of play as India lost their ninth wicket and Shreyas Iyer did not bat due to back pain.

His wife, Bollywood actor Anushka Sharma, took to social media after the end of day's play to say the former captain was ""playing through sickness"" during his epic knock.

Australia reached three for no loss at stumps with Travis Head getting the runs while alongside night watchman Matthew Kuhnemann.

The left-handed Kuhnemann made a surprise entry to the crease after opener Usman Khawaja, who hit 180 in Australia's innings, did not come out to bat after getting hurt on the field.

Axar Patel, who shared a 162-run sixth-wicket partnership with Kohli, admitted that another Australia collapse like in the earlier Tests was unlikely, but that India would still try.

""It will not be like we will run through them like in the previous three games. We will have to work hard, keep patience and bowl on good areas,"" Axar said.

Kohli ruled the day with his 28th Test ton after he got a single off spinner Nathan Lyon in the second session to bring the house down as fans went wild with celebration.

Kohli, who now has 75 international tons across three international formats, kissed his locket before looking up to the sky.

Resuming on 59 after reaching his first Test half-century on Saturday since January 2022, the landmark came after a patient innings of 241 balls.

""He's a class player and he didn't give us a chance really,"" Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey said of the star batsman.

""We knew it was going to be tough bowling to Virat. We were able to contain him as much as we could and try to take wickets around him.""

Kohli then hit a flurry of fours after reaching his hundred and along with an attacking Axar, who made 79.

Khawaja attempted to catch an Axar six at the boundary but could not stay inside the rope, hurting his foot in the process and limping off the field.

It was termed as ""lower leg soreness"" by a team spokesperson and it was unclear if the batsman would play on the fifth day.

Kohli got past 150 after tea and Axar reached his third half-century of the series to wear down the opposition bowlers on a pitch vastly different from the rank turners in the previous three matches.

Spinners Lyon and Murphy bowled 110.5 overs between to get three wickets each on another day of hard grind for the bowlers.

Axar went into fifth gear after his fifty as he slogged and smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over before being bowled off an inside edge by Mitchell Starc.

Kohli lost his overnight partner Ravindra Jadeja for 28 in the morning session and Srikar Bharat fell in the afternoon after the wicketkeeper-batsman hit 44 in an 84-run partnership with the former captain.

Speaking on on SENQ Breakfast program, Kasprowicz said,"" I'm going to call it nose and toes. As a fast bowler, if we want to get stuck in, we either try and hit them on the nose or hit them on the toes.

""The fact that we've seen this wicket right now, it's just a bat-a-thon, we'll get nothing like the earlier games with the wicket turning square.

""My point is, Australia has picked the wrong team, what they had to do was pick at least three fast bowlers.

""(We've got Green and Starc), but one is an all-rounder and Starc is always good with an older ball.""

Meanwhile, Virat Kohli reached triple figures for the first time in 41 innings and a wait of more than three years to nudge India ahad of Australia on day four of the fourth test Sunday.

Kohli scored 186 runs, his 28th Test hundred and his highest test score against Australia, as India finished with 571 (178.5 overs) runs in its first innings to take a lead of 91 runs over Australia's first-innings total of 480 runs. At stumps, Matthew Kuhnemann and Travis Head (3 not out) negotiated six overs with Australia at 3-0 in its second innings, trailing by 88 runs.

Recalling the success in 2004, Kasprowicz said, "" But if we had three fast bowlers plus a spinner - this is the program we went with in India in 2004. The Australian side went in with Glenn McGrath who is the best ever, Jason Gillespie and myself, we also had Shane Warne who was a pretty hander spinner as well.

Virat Kohli showed impeccable grit, discipline and concentration to make a magnificent 186 as India took a 91-run lead over Australia after being bowled out for 571 in their first innings during the fourth Test at Narendra Modi Stadium on Sunday.

Kohli though was involved in a rather unfortunate incident during his stay at the crease on Sunday.

Kohli was running out of partners and with him batting in his 180s, he and Umesh Yadav were part of a run-out. He and Umesh tried to take a quick double, seeing the fielders back on the boundary ropes.

A spectacular fielding effort by Peter Handscomb left the Indian bowler short of his ground and having to leave for the dressing room without even facing a single ball.

WATCH:

Kohli was dropped at 185 when Handscomb tried to take the catch with both hands while diving, but shelled the chance. In the next over, Murphy bowled outside off-stump and Kohli went for the slog-sweep, but holed out to deep mid-wicket, bringing an end to India's innings as well as to Kohli's wonderful knock.

At stumps, Australia reached 3/0 in six overs of their second innings and trail India by 88 runs with one day left in the match. Travis Head made all the runs, as he and makeshift opener Matthew Kuhnemann, in place of an injured Usman Khawaja, negotiated the tricky six overs from Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami.

Virat Kohli on Sunday ended his century draught in Test cricket, bringing up the 28 ton in the format after a long gap of 1205 days. The former skipper was the second Indian batter to score a century in the fourth Test against Australia. After Shubman Gill's scintillating 128, Kohli top-scored with 186 and his 364-ball innings, laced with 15 boundaries, helped India take a 90-run lead in the first innings.

This was his 28th Test ton and 75th in international cricket, becoming the only second batter in the history of the game to reach the mark after the legendary Sachin Tendulkar. Kohli is often touted to match Tendulkar's colossal record of hundred centuries in international cricket. Though the former still needs 25 hundreds to reach that feat, several experts believe that it won't be a problem for Kohli to get there as he has fitness by his side.

Former Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh believes that not just 100 centuries but Kohli can even go beyond that. Speaking with Sports Tak on Sunday, the former Harbhajan said Kohli might be 34 years old but he possesses the fitness of a '24-year-old cricketer.'

""It's certainly possible. I think he can score more than that (100 centuries). Two things favour Virat here; his age, and his fitness. He's 34 but his fitness is that of a 24-year-old cricketer. He's way ahead in that aspect. He has already scored 75 centuries, he can score at least 50 more. He knows his game and he plays all formats,"" Harbhajan told Sports Tak.

""You might think I'm going overboard with this, but it is certainly possible. If anyone can do it, it's Virat Kohli. Rest all are far behind him. He knew he had to work on his fitness, because his batting abilities are god-gifted. I don't think he will stop from here. There are no technical faults, and even if they are, he works on them and rectifies them. Since his return (after break), he has already scored five centuries. This is pretty much a comeback for him,"" Harbhajan added.

Kohli scored 27 of his Test centuries in 141 innings, including the one which came in November 2019 during the day-night Test against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.

But for the 28th Test century and 75th of his international cricket career, it has taken 42 innings and more than three years to arrive. Kohli got his hundred in 241 balls at Ahmedabad, his second slowest century after his ton against England in the 2012/13 series coming off 289 balls.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Harbhajan Singh'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Off spin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day/night_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'night cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'England cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Eden Gardens'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/03/will-kohli-be-able-to-break-sachins-record-of-100-hundreds.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1215686274509804,416375640,1,news18.com,news,News18,Harbhajan Singh Virat Kohli Test cricket India International cricket Innings Australia national cricket team Off spin Batting (cricket) Captain (cricket) Cricket Sachin Tendulkar night cricket Umesh Yadav Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 England cricket team Eden Gardens Ahmedabad Kolkata,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,54,3,2023-03-13

AHMEDABAD, India:Virat Kohli ended his agonising wait for a test century with a painstaking 186 as India racked up 571 to claim a lead of 91 in the fourth and final test against Australia on Sunday.

The hosts, who lead the series 2-1, strung together six 50-plus partnerships at the top to effectively put themselves in an unbeatable position heading into the final day of the contest.

Having conceded a handy first-innings lead, Australia finished day four on three for no loss.

The touring side sent nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann to open with Travis Head after in-form opener Usman Khawaja hurt his knee while fielding.

Kuhnemann, who survived 18 balls, was nearly caught on two occasions but Australia somehow saw off the final six overs without any damage.

Earlier, India lost Ravindra Jadeja (28) after resuming on 289-3 but Kohli and KS Bharat denied Australia another success in that slow-moving session.

Todd Murphy (3-113) broke Kohli's 64-run partnership with Jadeja, who chipped the ball to Khawaja at mid-on.

Kohli was happy to nudge the ball around, while Bharat hit Nathan Lyon for a six before putting his head down and accumulating runs without taking too many risks.

Promoted in the batting order as Shreyas Iyer did not bat because of back pain, Bharat accelerated after the lunch break, hitting Green for back-to-back sixes and following it with a four in a 21-run over.

Bharat fell to Lyon after making 44, but Kohli could not be denied his first test hundred since November 2019.

The right-hander took a single off Lyon to bring up his 75th international century. Kohli kissed the locket of his necklace and looked skywards in a muted celebration.

Patel, who smashed four sixes and five fours in his belligerent 79, continued his red-hot form with the bat, registering his third half-century of the series.

The left-hander smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over and was looking good for a maiden test hundred before he dragged a Mitchell Starc delivery on to his stumps.

Patel's 162-run stand for the sixth wicket with Kohli was the highest in the Indian innings.

""At first we were chasing their score. Once we went past, the talk was that if I get a bad ball, I would hit it,"" Patel said.

With Ravichandran Ashwin and Umesh Yadav falling in quick succession and Iyer not available to bat, Kohli realised he was running out of partners and tried to accelerate.

He became the last Indian wicket to fall, holing out to Marnus Labuschagne at long-on to depart after a 364-ball knock, which included 15 fours.

Lyon alone bowled 65 of Australia's 178.5 overs on a flat track where bowlers found little assistance.

""Once a batter is set, there isn't a lot in it for the bowlers,"" Patel said of the nature of the track at the Narendra Modi Stadium.

""There are a few odd balls that stayed low, maybe after pitching on the rough. But once you get set, you get an idea of the wicket and it gets easier.""

India are chasing a victory in Ahmedabad to confirm their place in the final of the World Test Championship against Australia in June.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwatchman_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nightwatchman (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting order (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fielding (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Umesh Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/virat-kohli-1-1019x573.jpg,eng-8469535,-0.01960784313725494,416375700,1,cnbctv18.com,news,cnbctv18.com,India Australia Ravindra Jadeja Usman Khawaja Boundary (cricket) Nightwatchman (cricket) Travis Head Cricket bat Nathan Lyon Batting order (cricket) Fielding (cricket) Over (cricket) Shreyas Iyer Umesh Yadav Marnus Labuschagne Ravichandran Ashwin Narendra Modi Stadium Mitchell Starc ICC World Test Championship Stump (cricket) Innings Wicket Bowling (cricket) Batting (cricket) Ahmedabad,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,55,3,2023-03-13

Kohli now has 75 international hundreds across all three formats, and his latest effort has given India the edge leading into the final day of the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.

The 34-year-old had last scored a red-ball ton (136) in the pink-ball Test against Bangladesh in 2019 at the Eden Gardens.

India, riding on the back of six 50-plus partnerships, finished their first innings at 571 for 9 at the Narendra Modi Stadium after Shreyas Iyer did not bat due to a recurrence of a lower back injury.

The visitors, having conceded a 91-run lead, were 3 for no loss at close of play on Day 4 - with Travis Head (3) and nightwatchman Matthew Kuhnemann (0), who opened the batting in place of an injured Usman Khawaja, at the crease. They trail by 88 runs on a wicket which still looks worth a thousand runs.

Kuhnemann had a lucky escape when wicketkeeper KS Bharat failed to grab a snick in the penultimate over of the day bowled by R Ashwin.

The other notable feature of the day was 79 runs scored by allrounder Axar Patel. The left-hander added 162 runs for the sixth wicket with Kohli. He hit four massive sixes and five boundaries in his innings that has further enhanced his reputation as a quality batter.

Watching Kohli was akin to seeing a healthy ascetic depriving himself of much-needed sustenance. Australia's stand-in skipper Steve Smith did all he could to choke the runs. His spinners - led by the indefatigable Nathan Lyon - kept bowling around the imaginary fifth stump line to invite false strokes.

Lyon (3-151) and his rookie partner Todd Murphy (3-113) together bowled 110 overs between them. The veteran offie alone accounted for 65 overs, the most he has ever bowled in an innings.

Kohli, however, rarely played against the turn -- in his 516-minute stay at the wicket. His hundred, which was his second slowest ever came off 241 deliveries and had only five hits to the fence. The self-imposed discipline lasted till he got over the three-figure mark in the 138th over of the innings.

His first boundary of the day -- a straight drive off Mitchell Starc -- came after he had faced 162 deliveries. As he coasted towards a huge personal score, two consecutive boundaries off Cameron Green took him to 150.

Kohli was eventually dismissed by Murphy for 186 after he holed out in the deep while attempting to stretch the lead. The former India captain batted for 364 deliveries and hit 15 fours in his innings.

Murphy, incidentally, has dismissed Kohli four times in this series.

Earlier, India resumed at 289 for 3, but lost Ravindra Jadeja before lunch. Runs were hard to come by as the Australian bowlers stuck to the plan of packing one side of the field with seven fielders. Only 73 runs were added in the 32 overs.

Jadeja took 84 balls to score 28 and eventually ran out of patience. He was dismissed by Murphy while attempting to clear Khawaja at mid-on.

As the Sunday crowd expected Iyer to come out next, they were in for a surprise as KS Bharat walked in instead. The BCCI informed through a statement that Iyer's back injury had flared up. It is the same injury which had kept him out of the three ODIs against New Zealand and the first Test versus Australia at Nagpur.

""Shreyas Iyer complained of pain in his lower back following the third day's play. He has gone for scans and the BCCI Medical Team is monitoring him,"" read the BCCI update.

Bharat's bat made the right noises as he clattered Lyon for a six over mid-wicket and then hooked Green for a couple of sixes in the 134th over of the innings. As he looked primed to reach his maiden Test fifty, the wicketkeeper-batter fell bat-pad to Lyon for 44.

The last three years have been the toughest in Virat Kohli's career. He has seen it all -- dip in form, losing captaincy in all three formats and then trolled for blocking an entry of a talented youngster in the Indian team. But one thing that kept him going is his hard work, perseverance and the never-say-die attitude that has seen him overcome many hurdles.

Kohli's lean patch in Test cricket had become a hot topic of discussion. Since giving up captaincy in all formats, Kohli's form dipped further. While many believed that letting go of captaincy would bring the best out of him and see him at his free-flowing best, the opposite happened. The 34-year-old has waited for more than three years to get to his 28th Test ton; the last one being in November 2019 against Bangladesh at Kolkata. The 42-innings wait finally ended on a decent surface at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Sunday.

There was a time when Kohli produced centuries at the drop of a hat. Fans thought that Kohli surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's 100 international centuries was a certainty. But his problems with the BCCI mandarins and the sudden drop in form and confidence made him a pale shadow of himself, so much so that there were many experts who felt that Kohli has had his time.

Luckily, he has had many admirers and advisers, none bigger than Ravi Shastri, who had worked wonders as head coach when Kohli was the captain. It was the former India all-rounder who advised him on how to get out of the mire he was stuck in -- runs and confidence-wise. Shastri firmly believed that there was nothing wrong with Kohli's technique and it was purely a mental issue.

""Just look at this... you are the best player in the world, have 70-plus centuries. Suddenly your form dips and batting deteriorates, your captaincy is taken away, and you are being misquoted. A lot has happened. It's a cluster of various things that has happened to you. So, probably [taking] some time off is the best for you,"" was Shastri's advice when Kohli was at his lowest ebb.

Kohli did pay heed to Shastri's advice, took a well-deserved break and did a lot of introspection during that time. He came back fresher and got three hundreds in ODIs (113 v Bangladesh in December 2022, 113 and 166* v Sri Lanka in January this year) and even in a T20I one (122* against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup in September last year). But a Test century eluded him till he finally broke the jinx here on Sunday. It was his most laboured century, coming at a leisurely pace of 241 balls, with just five boundaries. He was so determined to reach the three-figure mark that he did not hit a single boundary on the fourth morning, till he reached the milestone. He soon celebrated the occasion with a couple of fours and a six to give vent to his emotions. In the end, he ran out of partners and was unable to add to his seven Test double centuries.

For the record, this is Kohli's 28th Test century, to add to 46 in ODIs and one in T20I, making a grand tally of 75, the second-most after Tendulkar's 100 hundreds. Will Kohli threaten to beat Tendulkar's record, only time will tell. But he will surely be happy to get a hundred in his favourite format.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'England cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'All-rounder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Board of Control for Cricket in India'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladesh'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladesh'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}]",https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2023/mar/ravi-shatri-kohli_d.jpg,eng-8469535,0.0117647058823529,416377740,1,mid-day.com,news,mid-day,Virat Kohli Captain (cricket) Test cricket India Ravi Shastri England cricket team India national cricket team Ahmedabad Border–Gavaskar Trophy Narendra Modi Stadium Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 All-rounder Australia national cricket team Sachin Tendulkar Board of Control for Cricket in India Kolkata Asia Cup Century (cricket) Boundary (cricket) Batting (cricket) One Day International Twenty20 International Sri Lanka Bangladesh Afghanistan,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,29,4,2023-03-13

If it was the turn of young turk Shubman Gill to make a statement on Saturday, then Sunday was all about the old warhorse. In an admirable display of mind over matter, Virat Kohli produced his most meaningful knock in the last three years, an eight-and-a-half-hour epic in which he travelled through the gears to give India a whiff of a chance in the final Test.

For 23 Tests since his 27th century at the Eden Gardens in November 2019, Kohli had unsuccessfully tilted at three-figures. On the penultimate day of the four-match Test series against Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium, he finally reached the Promised Land, his awe-inspiring 186 forming the basis on which India erected a monumental 571.

With excellent support from KS Bharat and the eye-catching Axar Patel, Kohli ground the Australian attack to the dirt on a track that held up quite decently. Needing 91 to make India bat again, nightwatchman Matt Kuhnemann -- standing in for Usman Khawaja, nursing an unspecified leg injury -- and Travis Head batted out the six overs to stumps to take Australia to three without loss.

Kohli had showcased more than occasional glimpses of his determination on Day Three when he worked his way to a measured 59, and much of the same traits were visible on the fourth morning when he and Ravindra Jadeja resumed at 289 for three, still 191 behind. Jadeja perished to an ill-advised aerial drive, 27 minutes into the day, but Kohli was in a zone of his own creation. The onus for the first session and a half was occupation of the crease, picking up the runs when the opportunity presented itself and not going looking for them.

Predominantly using the leg-side to pick up ones and twos, Kohli's first four of the day didn't come until his 123rd delivery, by which time Bharat had uncorked a useful cameo. Batting at No. 6 with Shreyas Iyer unavailable due to a back injury, Bharat showed enterprise, as did Axar, who held his own during a 182-run stand with Kohli that knocked the stuffing out of the Aussies.

Kohli's muted celebrations on reaching 100 No. 28 indicated that he wasn't done yet, and it was no surprise to see him play with greater freedom after getting the monkey off his back. Having taken 241 deliveries to get to 100 with five fours, he then dipped into his huge repertoire, exquisite timing, impeccable placement and electric running between the wickets helping him to his next 86 runs in just 123 more balls with 10 further fours. As India provided only the third instance in Test history of the first six wickets all producing half-century stands, Australia felt the heat. As they will on Monday, the pronounced lack of assistance to bowlers notwithstanding.

He scored 186 in the first innings of the fourth Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test on Sunday and helped India post a huge total of 570 runs, giving a lead of 91 runs.

This was Kohli's 75 century in international cricket across formats. Kohli also became the second Indian batter to reach the milestone after the great Sachin Tendulkar. Fans and former cricketers often consider that Virat Kohli will breach Tendulkar's run-scoring records.

Former legendary off-spinner Harbhajan Singh made a huge prediction about Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar.

""It's certainly possible. I think he can score more than that (100 centuries). Two things favour Virat here; his age, and his fitness. He's 34 but his fitness is that of a 24-year-old cricketer. He's way ahead in that aspect. He has already scored 75 centuries, he can score at least 50 more. He knows his game and he plays all formats,"" Harbhajan told Sports Tak.

""You might think I'm going overboard with this, but it is certainly possible. If anyone can do it, it's Virat Kohli. Rest all are far behind him. He knew he had to work on his fitness, because his batting abilities are god-gifted. I don't think he will stop from here. There are no technical faults, and even if they are, he works on them and rectifies them. Since his return (after break), he has already scored five centuries. This is pretty much a comeback for him,"" Harbhajan further added.

The former Punjab-based spinner also stated that after the bowler-friendly pitches in the first three Tests, Indian batters required a batting-friendly surface like the one in Ahmedabad.

""It's nice that he (Kohli) got a chance to bat on a pitch that assists batters. Earlier, the games used to end in three days and bowlers ruled the roost. Virat, Rohit (Sharma), (Cheteshwar) Pujara also have the right to get pitches where they can score runs. A fifty on bowling-friendly surfaces is like a hundred, and they've done that,"" Harbhajan said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Harbhajan Singh'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Off spin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}]",https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2023/03/13/eb1e4fe3b28d38345a10a8eef8614a391678681645145567_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=1200&imheight=628,eng-8469535,0.2862745098039217,416378220,1,news.abplive.com,news,english,Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) Test cricket India Sachin Tendulkar Harbhajan Singh International cricket Innings Australia national cricket team Ahmedabad Off spin Cricket Spin bowling Cricket pitch Cricket bat,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,37,4,2023-03-13

Kohli, who, stepped down as India skipper from all formats back in January of 2022, put on the captaincy hat during an intense chat with Axar Patel. With India bowling on a Day 5 surface, spinners Axar, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are looking to land the ball on the rough created over the previous four days, and between overs as the players regrouped, Kohli gave some rather animated instructions to Axar as Rohit Sharma looked on.

Unlike the first three and a half day, there has been some life injected in the Ahmedabad surface with the ball doing something for the spinners. Although Australia lost just one wicket so far in the first session, there have been quite a few close calls for India, with the ball jumping off the rough and troubling the batters. Some have hit the bad, struck Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne on the gloves and had there been a forward short-leg, India could have had a second wicket.

Which is perhaps why Virat Kohli in between overs, walked up to Axar and pointed out towards a certain area on the pitch asking him to land the ball precisely at that very point. Such was the dedication of Kohli that even though Rohit stepped in, he was content taking the backset and allow Virat to dictate proceedings.

Watch the video below:

India are going to get in and around this area that is somehow outside off-stump... maybe a foot and a half outside. Just tempt Marnus Labuschagne to play through covers,"" Matthew Hayden said while doing commentary.

His partner Sunil Gavaskar then chipped in: ""Yes I think they are talking about the length and line. But that's not the line for the left-hander, it will be to a right-hander. If it's to a left-hander it will mean that the ball will turn away quite safely. I think for the right hander, Ashwin, that line would be more beneficial.""

India did not have to wait too long ton get a breakthrough. After KS Bharat dropped a catch of Matthew Kuhnemann, Ravichandran Ashwin sent the nightwatchman packing by getting him out LBW for 6. However, Head and Labuschagne played out the session without any further damage taking Australia to 73/1 at lunch on Day 5, trailing by 18 runs.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravindra Jadeja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2016', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rohit Sharma'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Matthew Hayden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Leg before wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/13/1600x900/kohli-captain-rohit-screengrab_1678687306698_1678687314269_1678687314269.jpg,eng-8469535,-0.05882352941176472,416383740,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Virat Kohli Captain (cricket) India Spin bowling Ahmedabad Ravindra Jadeja Border–Gavaskar Trophy Narendra Modi Stadium Axar Patel Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016 Rohit Sharma Over (cricket) Wicket Bowling (cricket) Test cricket Marnus Labuschagne Travis Head Ravichandran Ashwin Cricket pitch Australia national cricket team Matthew Hayden Leg before wicket Sunil Gavaskar,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,9,6,2023-03-13

As Virat Kohli ended his century drought in the fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar pointed out former skipper's hundred was not a much-needed feat as the stylish India batter has never seen out of form.

Kohli scored 186 runs off 364 deliveries, his first century in the format since November 2019, as India posted a mammoth 571 on the board in response to Australia's 480 at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Sunday.

""Every great batter thinks about a hundred. A century is the minimum price he keeps for his wicket. The way Kohli was batting in the last two-and-a-half years when he didn't score a century, he was batting well, scored seven or eight fifties. So, it never seemed that he was out of form. The only thing that was happening was that he was getting out on his first mistake,"" said Gavaskar on Star Sports.

Kohli got his hundred in 241 balls at Ahmedabad, his second slowest century after his ton against England in the 2012/13 series coming off 289 balls. However, the batting great felt Kohli paced his innings perfectly.

""It was like how a Test match century should be constructed. He started slightly slowly, where he was trying to figure out the pitch and the bowling. Then he played a few shots after getting set and tried to play even more shots after he had scored a century. It shows how determined he was,"" Gavaskar said.

""He knew that India was quite far behind Australia, who had scored a mountain of runs. He had seen that Usman Khawaja played a 180-run knock and Cameron Green scored a century for Australia, and Shubman Gill played a 128-run knock. This was a good opportunity for him to play a big knock so that the Indian team reaches close to 480,"" he added.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Star Sports (Indian TV network)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'England cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/03/virat-kohli-took-the-helmet-off-and-soaked-it-all-in-ap-photo.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1372549019607843,416384520,1,news18.com,news,News18,Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) Test cricket India Sunil Gavaskar Australia Border–Gavaskar Trophy Cricket Narendra Modi Stadium Star Sports (Indian TV network) Shreyas Iyer Wicket Usman Khawaja Cricket pitch Innings England cricket team Bowling (cricket) India national cricket team Shubman Gill Ahmedabad,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,22,6,2023-03-13

The hosts, who lead the series 2-1, strung together six 50-plus partnerships at the top to effectively put themselves in an unbeatable position heading into the final day of the contest.

Having conceded a handy first-innings lead, Australia finished day four on three for no loss. The touring side sent nightwatchman Matt Kuhne­mann to open with Travis Head after in-form opener Usman Khawaja hurt his knee while fielding.

Kuhnemann was nearly caught on two occasions but Australia somehow saw off the final six overs without any damage.

Earlier, India lost Ravi­ndra Jadeja (28) after resu­ming on 289-3 but Kohli and KS Bharat denied Australia another success in that session.

Todd Murphy (3-113) broke Kohli's 64-run partnership with Jadeja, who chipped the ball to Khawaja at mid-on.

Kohli was happy to nudge the ball around, while Bharat hit Nathan Lyon for a six before putting his head down and accumulating runs without taking too many risks.

Bharat accelerated after the lunch break, hitting Green for back-to-back sixes and following it with a four in a 21-run over.

Bharat fell to Lyon after making 44, but Kohli could not be denied his first Test hundred since November 2019.

The right-hander took a single off Lyon to bring up his 75th international century. Kohli kissed the locket of his necklace and looked skywards in a muted celebration.

Patel, who smashed four sixes and five fours in his belligerent 79, continued his red-hot form with the bat, registering his third half-century of the series.

The left-hander smashed Kuhnemann for two sixes in an over and was looking good for a maiden Test hundred before he dragged a Mitchell Starc delivery onto his stumps.

Patel's 162-run stand for the sixth wicket with Kohli was the highest in the Indian innings. With Ravic­h­andran Ashwin and Ume­sh Yadav falling in quick succession and Iyer not available to bat, Kohli realised he was running out of partners and tried to accelerate.

He became the last Ind­ian wicket to fall, holing out to Marnus Labus­chagne at long-on to depart after a 364-ball knock, which included 15 fours.

Kohli scored his 28th Test hundred after a wait of 1205 days as his last century came against Bangladesh on November 23, 2019 at Eden Gardens.

Kohli's ton delighted his fans who were waiting for the former India skipper to come good and show his vintage best. Kohli's magnificent innings received a lot of attention on social media as fans posted congratulatory tweets. Among them, a witty tweet by the official account of Delhi Police is going viral.

Delhi Police requested their Gujarat counterparts not to book ""our Delhi boy"" Virat Kohli for ""voluntarily causing hurt to the guests"". ""Bura na maano Kohli hai (Don't feel offended, Kohli is there),"" reads a text on the photo of Virat Kohli that they tweeted.

Shared Sunday, the tweet has received more than 14,000 likes. ""Well said @DelhiPolice,"" commented a user. ""Tweet of the day,"" said another.

""Considering the nature of hurt, it seems to be falling under section 95 of IPC. So, I don't think @imVkohli needs to be booked,"" Parth Parmar, a policeman who is posted as a deputy superintendent, joked.

""Keen to see what @GujaratPolice responds here,"" posted another.

Watch | Cricket News","Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill were in the spotlight during India's innings in the ongoing fourth and final Test match against Australia. While the rising star Gill shone with his 128-run knock at the start of the innings, the batting veteran Kohli raced to his 28th Test century (186 runs) -- a hundred in the format after more than three years. Both the batters used the friendly conditions at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad beautifully to their advantage. The duo, however, is also being talked about due to a bromance video that has gone viral on the internet.

In the video that is making the rounds on social media, Kohli could be seen approaching to Gill during India's fielding in the Ahmedabad Test. In the clip, Kohli funnily tries to twist Gill's left hand after getting involved in some light discussion with him. The youngster eventually manages to escape by removing his hand from Kohli's grip.

Virat Kohli, who self-confessed he enjoys an on-field verbal confrontation as it charges him up, was caught in conversation with the umpire Nitin Menon during the 5th day of the 4th Test during the ongoing Border Gavaskar series.

The incident happened during the 34.3rd over when Travis Head was trapped LBW by Ravichanchandra Ashwin. Umpire Nitin Menon didn't give it out as Indian went for the referral. DRS showed that the decision was umpire's call.

A frustrated Kohli, was heard taking a dig at the umpire. In response to the same, Kohli said - Mai hota to out tha ( If it was me, It would have been out). Menon sure heard Kohli's comments, but took it sportingly, nodded along, and gave him a thumbs up.

Menon's umpiring has come under scrutiny in the ongoing series. The Indian umpire has faced criticism from several quarters for his poor standard of umpiring in this series. During the third Test in Indore, Menon had close to half a dozen decisions that were reversed.

In the second Test too, his decision to adjudge Virat Kohli lbw drew severe criticism for him. His poor performance even made several fans accuse him of being biased towards Virat Kohli.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitin_Menon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Nitin Menon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Umpire (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Leg before wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2023-03/5b4a2026-c763-465d-801c-e13e79f2a358/Nitin_menon.PNG?rect=0%2C0%2C3900%2C2194&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,eng-8469535,-0.2235294117647059,416390700,1,freepressjournal.in,news,Free Press Journal,Nitin Menon Umpire (cricket) Virat Kohli Test cricket Narendra Modi Stadium Australia national cricket team Ahmedabad Leg before wicket Travis Head Ravichandran Ashwin Indore,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,5,8,2023-03-13

Kohli recently ended his Test century drought after a wait of 1205 days at the Narendra Modi Stadium.

Suryakumar Yadav took his place for the remaining overs in the day.

Former India captain Virat Kohli on Sunday smashed his 28th century in red-ball cricket during the ongoing 4th Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Ahmedabad. Kohli hit 186 off 364 balls to register his highest-ever score against the Aussies. Kohli's knock was made up of 15 boundaries and 126 singles, which he scored with a strike rate of 51.09. This was Kohli's first Test century in more than three years. His last Test hundred came against Bangladesh in a pink-ball match in November 2019.

Thanks to Kohli's magnificent knock, Team India was able to post a mammoth 571 runs in the first innings with a lead of 91 runs. After Kohli scored his 75th international hundred on Sunday, his wife Anushka Sharma took to her official Instagram handle to reveal that he was playing through sickness. She shared a story on her official account, where she wrote, ""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always,"" Anushka wrote.

Kohli did not come out to the field during Australia's second innings on Day 4. Suryakumar Yadav took his place for the remaining overs in the day. Kohli's dedication to the game is just mind-blowing as it was on full display during his innings against Australia in the 4th Test. He ran over 2.5 kilometers for just singles and that too with a fever. Kohli scored 126 runs between the wickets apart from his 15 boundaries.

Pitch length - 22 yards

Kohli scored - 186 runs (60 in fours, 126 singles)

126 × 22 = 2772 yards of running, completely padded up in Gujarat heat

2772 yards = 2.5 km

With his century, Kohli broke multiple records in the longest format of the game. Kohli has now become India's highest run-scorer in World Test Championship history. The 34-year-old now has 1803 runs from 31 matches at an average of 36.79. Kohli also registered his highest individual score against Australia in Test cricket. Kohli is now the highest run-scorer for India in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He has amassed 297 runs from four matches at an average of 49.50. Earlier, Kohli equaled Sunil Gavaskar's record for the joint second-most tons by an Indian player against Australia, trailing only Sachin Tendulkar.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Suryakumar Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Strike rate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'First-class cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Gujarat'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Gujarat'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/hmfolf5naqwk8mlb_1678698486.jpeg,eng-8469535,0.1372549019607843,416396580,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket Over (cricket) Suryakumar Yadav Australia Border–Gavaskar Trophy Strike rate First-class cricket Captain (cricket) Cricket Ahmedabad India Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 India national cricket team Sunil Gavaskar ICC World Test Championship Boundary (cricket) Sachin Tendulkar Wicket Gujarat,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,43,9,2023-03-13

Is it the 183 against Pakistan at the 2012 Asia Cup, or the unbeaten 133 against Sri Lanka a couple of months before in the CB Series where he took Lasith Malinga to the cleaners? Or was it the following year, when Kohli blasted a century off 52 balls to help India gun down 359 against Australia? Well, to be honest, the answer is none of the above. The making of Kohli can be traced back to the year 2014.

Kohli had just come back from England after enduring the worst Test series of his career where he batting, technique and mindset was exposed by James Anderson as Kohli struggled on his way to scoring 134 runs in five Tests. A few months later, Kohli was under intense pressure as another high-profile tour awaited - against Australia. Many doubted whether it would be the end of Kohli, but what transpired down under brought him out like a diamond. Kohli achieved batting nirvana in Australia scoring 692 runs in four Tests, including four centuries. Kohli started the Border Gavaskar Trophy as captain in the first Test, when MS Dhoni was ruled out due to a thumb injury and led from the front scoring twin centuries in Adelaide.

It was there that former Australia speedster Mitchell Johnson and Kohli had one of the most memorable face-offs of all time. A menacing pacer up against a fiery youngster - it was always going to be a contest to watch out for and boy... the battle sure did live up to the moniker. Recalling the series and Kohli's tenacity, Johnson highlighted Virat's knack of brining the fire back to Australia is what forced him and rest of his teammates to take note of the then-youngster.

""I've contributed to a few of those hundreds. The beauty of playing Test cricket for me was playing against the best. I always felt like he was a great player but I think the different that I found was that he brough the fire back and he actually put it back on us. We would always be quite aggressive as Australian players but he put it back on us and that's why it probably surprised us at times,"" Johnson said while doing commentary in the fourth Test between India and Australia in Ahmedabad on Monday.

""You often look at different players across different countries and you wonder they can play for your team and Virat Kohli was one of those guys that you would have in your team not just for his amazing batting but because of the attitude that he brought and the fight that he had.""

\The sight of Johnson picking up the ball after Kohli had defended it back to him and then throwing it back at the batter hitting him on the body remains an everlasting one. And the fact that Kohli refused to accept Johnson's apology on his way to 115 and 141 was the stuff of legends. But it was the first ever ball that Johnson bowled to Kohli that set up the tempo for the series and one that sent alarm bells in the Australian camp that they were witnessing something special.

""I think it was the first ball I bowled. I hit him on the helmet... on the badge... it was a different time. There was a bit going on with Phil Hughes' passing and that sort of shook us up. But even just after that you could see the determination on his face being struck on the helmet. Throughout the whole series, just that fight. It was an outstanding tour by India; they really did fight hard,"" added the former Aussie quick.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2016', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasith_Malinga', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Lasith Malinga'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderson_(cricketer)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'James Anderson (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Not out'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'England cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitin_Menon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nitin Menon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'MS Dhoni'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Umpire (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fast bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Adelaide'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Adelaide'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Hughes', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Phillip Hughes'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/13/1600x900/kohli-pakistan-asia-cup-getty_1678699891720_1678699897334_1678699897334.jpg,eng-8469535,-0.003921568627450966,416396940,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Virat Kohli Test cricket Australia Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016 Batting (cricket) Lasith Malinga James Anderson (cricketer) Asia Cup Not out England cricket team India Nitin Menon Border–Gavaskar Trophy MS Dhoni Umpire (cricket) Fast bowling Captain (cricket) Adelaide Phillip Hughes Bowling (cricket) Ahmedabad,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,49,9,2023-03-13

Both the batters used the batting-friendly conditions to the helm at the Narendra Modi Stadium. On the final day of the Test, a video went viral where the duo shared a great camaraderie on the field.

In the video, Kohli was spotted advancing towards Gill during India's fielding and tried to bully him by twisting his left hand after having a light conversation. Gill went on to escape from Kohli's firm grip by removing his hand.

In the ongoing test, Virat Kohli ended his Test century drought by hitting his 28th century, taking 241 balls to get to the three-figure mark. He scored a huge 186 in the first innings of the fourth Border-Gavaskar Trophy match. This was also Kohli's 75 century in international cricket across formats. The former India skipper also became the second India batter to reach the milestone after the great Sachin Tendulkar.

Post his century, Kohli's wife Anushka Sharma shared a post on her social media handle where she wrote, ""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always..."".

Apart from Kohli and Gill, lower-order batter Axar Patel also played a crucial knock of 79 runs and built a solid 162-run partnership with Virat which helped India reach 571 runs. In reply to India's total of 571 runs, Travis Head and Matthew Kuhnemann started the proceedings but then Kuhnemann got out. Head alongside Marnus Labuschagne batted brilliantly before Head was sent off to the pavilion by Axar Patel after well-made 90 runs. Labuschagne scored an unbeaten 63 runs while Smith made 10 not out.

After making a return to form in T20Is and One Day Internationals (ODIs), Kohli's 28th Test ton is a big sigh of relief for the former Indian skipper and his fans.

It was on November 23, 2019, when Kohli had last hit a Test ton. But after that knock, a dry spell started for even Kohli in the format, and went on for over 3 years. During that phase Kohli had a series poor performances, faced severe criticism, lost captaincy, and had a huge mental strain.

But, in the fourth Test against Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, Kohli's century has shown that he is back to his best. He started off slow and dealt mainly in singles and doubles with KS Bharat launching an attack against Cameron Green scoring 21 runs in an over.

A special century: There is huge difference between the Kohli we had seen nearly five years ago and the one who we are seeing now. After his 28th century, Kohli didn't show much excitement in celebration and there was no anger. Instead, what we saw was Kohli calmly taking off his helmet, and raising his bat towards the Indian dressing room with a smile.

He kissed the chain he wears around his neck and the wedding ring. Ravi Shastri, who was in the commentary box, mentioned the calm and maturity shown by Kohli. ""He'll remember all those days what he went through,"" Shastri said.

Kohli had shown the same attitude when he rescued India in a T20 World Cup match against Pakistan at Melbourne in October 2022.

Steve Smith, Joe Root and Kohli: Kohli, with 27 Test centuries in 2019 looked like he would smash all the records. His contemporaries, like Australia's Steve Smith and England's Joe Root were behind him in 2019. But in the last three years, as Kohli's form dipped , Smith and Root have raced past him.

While Smith has 30 Test centuries, having slammed four in the last three years, Joe Root went miles ahead hitting 12 Test tons during the same period. In 2019, Root had 17 Test centuries. But now he has 29 centuries.

At the ICC Test batting rankings, Steve Smith, with a rating of 873 is at number two spot, while Joe Root with 871 is at the third spot. Kohli has fallen behind with 651 points, and is at number 20.

However, it's never too late and Kohli, with the kind of form he is in today, might be dominating 2023. After the Test series, India will play Australia in a three-match ODI series that starts from March 17.

India qualify for the WTC Final: Also, apart from Kohli's good form, there is another good news for team India. The Indian team has now qualified for the World Test Championship (WTC) Final after New Zealand edged past Sri Lanka on the final ball in a dramatic finish to the first Test in Christchurch on Monday (March 13).",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Joe Root'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Smith (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket World Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International Cricket Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Christchurch'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Christchurch'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Melbourne'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Melbourne'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}}}]",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/dailyo//resources/202303/blob130323125416.png,eng-8469535,0.03529411764705892,416398200,1,dailyo.in,news,Ananya Bhattacharya,Virat Kohli Test cricket Australia Joe Root Captain (cricket) One Day International India Ravi Shastri Narendra Modi Stadium Batting (cricket) Twenty20 International Ahmedabad Steve Smith (cricketer) Cricket bat Cricket World Cup Twenty20 Pakistan ICC World Test Championship International Cricket Council India national cricket team Christchurch Melbourne New Zealand Sri Lanka,India,IN,English,eng,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,10,10,2023-03-13

Virat Kohli roared back to form with a sublime century during the fourth Test between India and Australia in Ahmedabad, and the former skipper said that he was relieved with the way he played, while also adding that he was happy with his defensive shots.

Kohli scored 186 runs off 364 balls in India's first innings, helping the hosts post 571 in reply to Australia's 480. That helped India gain a 91-run lead going into Australia's second innings.

Kohli was involved in 50-run partnerships with Shubman Gill, Ravindra Jadeja and KS Bharat, but an impressive 162-run stand with Axar Patel was what changed the complexion of the game.

Kohli won the Player of the Match for his heroics in Ahmedabad.

""To be honest, the expectations I have from myself as a player is more to important to me. I felt I was batting well from the first innings at Nagpur. We focussed on batting for long. I did that to an extent but not to the capability that I have done in the past. Was a little disappointed for that,"" the 34-year-old said at the presentation ceremony.

Kohli further explained how the team's batting strategy changed following Shreyas Iyer's injury.

""Relief from the point of view that I could play the way I wanted to play. I was happy with my defence. I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field.

""When I was 60 not out, we decided to play positively. But we lost Shreyas thanks to injury. So, we decided to play time. They were good with the ball and placed some good fields. We got a bit of a lead and gave ourself some sort of a chance,"" added the Delhi-born cricketer.

Kohli's century in Ahmedabad was his first Test ton since November 2019, when he had scored 136 against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.

While the fourth Test ended in a draw with India taking the series 2-1, Rohit Sharma and Co still qualified for the World Test Championship final in June, after New Zealand edged Sri Lanka in a thriller on Monday.

Over the years, Virat Kohli has established himself as a go-getter in the world of international cricket. His career stats aren't only praiseworthy but also revolutionary. The world of cricket has witnessed several record-breaking moments courtesy of the former all-format Indian captain, be it in Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs) or Twenty20 Internationals (T20s). Kohli has proved his mettle with dominant performances in all formats of the game.

This year began on a special note for Kohli with his brilliantly controlled innings of 166 runs off 110 balls in the final match of the three-match ODI series between India and Sri Lanka. Having scored his 21st century, Kohli broke two records held by the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, for scoring most ODI centuries at home and against a single team. The year 2023 also saw him overtake Sri Lankan batting maestro Mahela Jayawardene to occupy the fifth spot on the list of batsmen scoring most ODI runs. Only Sachin Tendulkar, Kumar Sangakkara, Ricky Ponting and Sanath Jayasuriya have more runs than Kohli now.

Putting an end to his Test century drought on Day 4 of the fourth and final Test match against Australia, Kohli led India's batting onslaught, top-scoring for the side as the hosts toppled Australia's mammoth 1st innings total. India, riding on his blistering knock, posted a colossal total of 571 in the first session at Ahmedabad, forging a 91-run lead.

The 34-year-old put on a batting masterclass to notch up a cracking century in 241 balls against Australia. His 75th international century was the second-slowest ton in his iconic career.

Interestingly, Kohli's wife and Bollywood star Anushka Sharma had said that the former India captain had played through sickness to score the century. Kohli said that while he and Axar Patel, with whom he had shared a 162-run partnership, had thought of playing positively after Day 3, the injury to Shreyas Iyer forced them to take the safer option of playing time.

""When I was 60 not out overnight, we did think about playing positively the next day but unfortunately we lost Shreyas to injury so we were a batter short. The plan then became to bat time and make sure the opposition doesn't sneak into the game. They are very good at doing that, finding opportunities and trying to get a result. I was happy with the tempo because of those reasons. The way the innings went, I felt that they had some very good fields and were very consistent with the balls. They didn't give me any boundary balls at all and I didn't want to create any because as I said, we were a batter short and that would have meant that we were just trying to struggle to make ends meet.

A century may have rubber-stamped his good form in Test cricket but Virat Kohli was never in doubt despite taking a mammoth 41 innings between his 27th and 28th hundred in the format. Kohli's 186 ensured India were in the safe zone that helped them to 571-all out in response to Australia's first innings total of 480-all out during the 4th Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy that ended in a draw on Monday.

It was a measured innings from Kohli who was quite patient during his 364-ball essay as he struck 15 fours during his stay. The former India captain though admits despite being in good nick, he hasn't been able to bat for as long as he has done in the past.

""To be honest, the expectations I have from myself as a player is more to important to me,"" Kohli said during the post-match presentation. ""I felt I was batting well from the first innings at Nagpur. We focused on batting for long. I did that to an extent but not to the capability that I have done in the past. Was a little disappointed for that.""

Kohli said he was able to bat as he wanted to but he no longer feels the need to prove anyone wrong. ""Relief from the point of view that I could play the way I wanted to play. I was happy with my defence. I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field,"" he said.

The fourth Test ended in a drab draw but Kohli revealed that the plan was to play positively until Shreyas Iyer was ruled out due to an injury and the team fell short of a batter.

""When I was 60 not out, we decided to play positively. But we lost Shreyas to injury and were a batter short. So, we decided to play time. They were good with the ball and placed some good fields.

It was shortly after Kohli had gotten out for 186 that Anushka took to Instagram to caption her story ""Playing through sickness with his composure. Inspiring me always."" The post creates a storm on social media with people worried if something was wrong with Kohli, more so after the former India captain had played a sedate knock en route to his first Test century after three years. After stumps, India all-rounder Axar Patel was asked the question about Kohli's health, to which he replied: ""I don't know. The way he was running between the wickets, it didn't look like he was sick. In such hot weather, he forged a such a great partnership and ran so well. It was fun batting with him.""

The reports of Kohli being ill were a bit off given he was always on the field. He returned to take his position in the slip cordon and fielded throughout the fifth day, indicating that all was well with King Kohli. The million-dollar question was then asked to captain Rohit Sharma shortly after the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2023 ended in a draw making India victorious with a 2-1 result. And hopefully, this update from Rohit ends the rumours once and for all. ""I don't think he is sick; he was just coughing a little bit, but I don't think it's that bad health wise,"" he said during the press conference.

Kohli ended his 40-month long wait for a Test century - his 28th. A lot has changed since Kohli scored his 27th century in November of 2019 - he was still India's all-formats captain, the world did not know about Covid-19, Shubman Gill hadn't made his Test debut and Suryakumar Yadav was yet to play for India - that is how long it had been. Kohli had returned to form in white-ball formats since last year's Asia Cup when he smashed his maiden T20I century and then struck two ODI tons in three matches recently. Test cricket was the only format where Kohli looked a bit out of sorts but this knock, which earned him the Player of the Match award, puts to rest any lingering doubts.

""Regarding Virat, I don't think there was any monkey on his back. When you're around a player like that, when you see how they go about their business, you don't feel that kind of thing going in his head or he's thinking about anything. He is just thinking about the moment. He wants to put up big performance for the team which he has done in the past so many years, and wants to do that everytime he gets the opportunity to do it for India.

India captain Rohit Sharma on Monday played down Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma's claim that her husband Virat Kohli was not well while he was batting on Day 4 of the Ahmedabad Test against Australia on Sunday.

Virat Kohli produced a sublime innings on Day 4 of the fourth Test to help India take lead over the Aussies in Ahmedabad.

Kohli scored 186 off 364 balls and batted for nearly 520 minutes before getting out in the final session as India posted 571 on the board with a first-innings lead of 91 runs over Australia.

Indian cricket fans were elated to see Kohli back among the runs as he scored a Test hundred after November 2019 to silence his critics and end his century-drought after more than three years.

The cricketing fraternity, including Anushka, took to social media to wish Kohli as the former India captain roared back to form in red-ball cricket.

Anushka posted a heartfelt message for Kohli on her Instagram story, and revealed that he was batting through sickness during the marathon knock.

""Playing through sickness with this compusure. Inspiring me always,"" Anushka Sharma captioned her Instagram story after Kohli's 28th Test hundred.

But Rohit Sharma said in the post-match press conference that Kohli wasn't actually sick but only coughing a bit.

""I don't think Virat Kohli was sick, but yeah he was coughing a bit,"" Rohit told reporters.

The match eventually finished in a high-scoring draw with India clinching the four-Test series 2-1.

They retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the fourth time in a row and qualified for the ICC World Test Championship final where they will again face Australia at The Oval from June 7.

Rohit lauds Kohli after Ahmedabad Test

The captain also credited Kohli for helping India take a commanding position in the fourth Test, even though the end result was a draw.

""Virat Kohli was the big reason behind the solid position of team in 4th Test. I don't think there was any monkey of Virat Kohli's back. He always loves to perform for the team like he's done for so many years,"" Rohit said.

Virat Kohli finished the series as the second-highest run-scorer after Usman Khawaja with 297 runs from four Tests including a hundred. Khawaja took the top spot with 333 runs, including a century and two fifties.

Kohli's 75th international century was also his 8th against Australia in Tests and 14th in the format on home soil.

Virat Kohli received the Player of the Match award for his classy century in India vs Australia 4th Test match at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. This was his first Test century for India in over three years, as he went on to score 186 runs off 422 runs in India's first batting innings. After the game ended in a draw, Kohli was questioned about the expectations that fans have of him.

Replying during the post-match presentation, the former India captain said the expectations he has from himself as a player is more important for him. He admitted to not being able to play in the tempo and template he has played for over a decade now. He then revealed that is one thing he was looking to do during the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2023.

""I felt like I was batting well from the first innings itself in Nagpur. But we focus more on trying to bat for as long as possible and trying to get the important runs for the team, I did that on a few occasions but not to the capabilities that I have done in the past for the tema, and from that perspective, I was a bit disappointed but there was a belief that I am playing well and if I get an opportunity or a descent wicket, I can get a big one,"" Kohli told the broadcaster.

The presenter then asked Kohli if he had a sense of relief after smashing the stunning century, where he hit only 15 fours. ""Again as I said relief from the point of view that I could play the way I wanted to play and I was patient enough and I wasn't getting desperate out there at all. I was very happy with my defence and the tempo I was playing. there wasn't relief from an achievements perspective, to be honest,"" he said.

The former skipper added that he is not in a place where he feels the need to prove someone wrong.

Sportzpics

Team India clinched a 2-1 Test series win over Australia as the latest edition of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy concluded in Ahmedabad on Monday. The fourth and final Test at the Narendra Modi Stadium ended in a draw, meaning that India retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for yet another time.

While India were playing Australia in Ahmedabad, New Zealand's last-ball win over Sri Lanka in the first Test in Christchurch confirmed India's place in the World Test Championship final in June, when they will face Australia once again.

The fourth Test also witnessed the resurgence of Virat Kohli, who notched up his 28 Test century, and his first in the format since November 2019, when he scored a ton against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens.

Australia's Usman Khawaja, who played a knock of 180 in Ahmedabad, finished as the top run-getter of the series with 333 runs, and he is followed by Virat Kohli (297 runs).

Senior all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin finished the series with most wickets (25), and claimed two five-wicket hauls.

Let's now take a look at some important statistics from the just-concluded Test series:

Records broken during India vs Australia Test series

-- Virat Kohli, who amassed 186 in Ahmedabad, became the fastest ever cricketer to score 11,000 international runs on home soil.

-- Australia's Nathan Lyon set a unique record during the Ahmedabad Test, becoming the first bowler to concede 500-plus runs to two different batters in Test cricket. Cheteshwar Pujara scored 570 runs against Lyon, while Kohli amassed 511 runs against the spinner.

-- Virat Kohli also broke Sachin Tendulkar's record of fewest games to reach 25,000 international runs if the innings are to go by. Kohli reached the milestone in 549 innings, while Tendulkar took 577 innings to the same.

-- Ravindra Jadeja broke R Ashwin's record of fewest overs bowled by Indians while taking seven-plus wickets in an innings in a Test match. Jadeja bowled 12.1 overs in Delhi to finish with figures of 7/42, while Ashwin, during his spell of 7/59 against New Zealand in 2016, took 13.5 overs.

-- After defeats in Nagpur and Delhi, Australia became the team with most Test defeats against India (32 losses). They broke the previous record that was set by England, against India (31 defeats).",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng':

Suryakumar Yadav took his place for the remaining overs in the day.

Indian skipper Rohit Sharma has contradicted Anushka Sharma over her claim that Virat Kohli was playing through sickness when he smashed his 28th Test century on Sunday. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Rohit said that Kohli was not seriously ill and was just coughing a little bit while batting in India's first innings in the 4th Test match in Ahmedabad. After Kohli ended his Test century drought last evening, Anushka took to her official Instagram handle to reveal that the former India skipper was batting through sickness.

Rohit has now contradicted Anushka's claim, saying that Kohli had a little bit of cough and that's it. Rohit clarified that Kohli was absolutely fine when he took the field for India in the 4th Test match on Sunday. ""I don't think he is sick. He was just coughing a little bit but I don't think he is that bad health-wise,"" Rohit said.

Anushka turned to Instagram to reveal that Kohli played through sickness. She shared a story on her official account, where she wrote, ""Playing through sickness with this composure. Inspiring me always,"". Kohli did not come out to field during Australia's second innings on Day 4. Suryakumar Yadav took his place for the remaining overs in the day.

Thanks to Kohli's magnificent knock, Team India was able to post a mammoth 571 runs in the first innings with a lead of 91 runs. Kohli hit 186 off 364 balls to register his highest-ever score against the Aussies. Kohli's knock was made up of 15 boundaries and 126 singles, which he scored with a strike rate of 51.09. This was Kohli's first Test century in more than three years. His last Test hundred came against Bangladesh in a pink-ball match in November 2019.

With this century, Kohli broke multiple records in the longest format of the game. Kohli has now become India's highest run-scorer in World Test Championship history. The 34-year-old now has 1803 runs from 31 matches which he has scored at an average of 36.79. Kohli also registered his highest individual score against Australia in Test cricket. The former India skipper is now the highest run-scorer for India in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He has amassed 297 runs from four matches at an average of 49.50. Earlier, Kohli equaled Sunil Gavaskar's record for the joint second-most tons by an Indian player against Australia, trailing only Sachin Tendulkar.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Rohit Sharma'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Suryakumar Yadav'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Strike rate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/f0v9qsdzydbfjvaa_1678709935.jpeg,eng-8469535,-0.05882352941176472,416408220,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Rohit Sharma Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Over (cricket) Suryakumar Yadav Batting (cricket) Captain (cricket) Ahmedabad Australia Sunil Gavaskar Border–Gavaskar Trophy Strike rate Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 ICC World Test Championship Sachin Tendulkar India national cricket team,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,57,12,2023-03-13

The 4th Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy ended in a draw on Day 5 as Australia declared their second batting innings while batting on 175/2. As the game was already into the final hour of play, the captains shook hands and decided to accept a draw, which meant that India secured a 2-1 win in Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2023. As Indian head coach Rahul Dravid spoke to the broadcaster after the match, the live feed showed Kohli pulling off a wholesome gesture for the Australian players.

Virat Kohli was seen meeting up with Aussie opener Usman Khawaja and wicketkeeper batter Alex Carey, in order to gift them his match shirts. Interestingly, Khawaja and Kohli scored individual centuries for their respective teams in the fourth Test at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The match marked Kohli's 75th international century and 28th Test century, which came after a gap of more than three years.

However, the hundred was knocking on Kohli's door for the entirety of the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2023. The 34-year-old had good starts on many occasions during the four-Test series, but never crossed the 50-run mark. However, he made the most of the batting conditions in Ahmedabad and went on to slam 186 runs off 364 runs. He batted at a strike rate of 51.09 with the help of 15 fours. He finished the series as the second-highest run-scorer with 297 runs in four games at an average of 49.50.

The century was the fifth 100+run knock for Kohli since September 2022. It is worth noting that Kohli went almost three years without scoring an international century. After taking a mental health break in July, Kohli returned to the field during the Asia Cup 2022 and silenced his critics in style. He hit his maiden T20I century against Afghanistan.

Indian star batter Virat Kohli, who ended his century drought in Tests with a patient 186 against Australia in Ahmedabad, on Monday said he's not in a ""space where I will go out and prove someone wrong"".

Kohli endured a painful wait of more than three years to notch his Test century number 28, the knock helping India finish with 571 in reply to Australia's 480 in the drawn fourth and final game.

""The expectations that I have for myself as a player are more important to me,"" Kohli told the official broadcasters after being adjudged Player of the Match.

""I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field,"" Kohli, who now has 75 international centuries, said.

""I think in Test cricket I wasn't able to play with my tempo and template that I have played with for the last 10 years for a while now. So that was the one thing I was trying to do. I felt like I was batting really well from the first innings in Nagpur.""

Kohli admitted he was not in his own in the Test format so he had to apply himself harder. Kohli faced 364 balls in his knock of 186 and scored only 60 runs in boundaries.

It was a deliberate ploy as India had a batter short in their XI after Shreyas Iyer pulled out because of a back injury.

""We lost Shreyas to injury and were a batter short. So, we decided to play time. We focused on batting long.

""We focussed more on batting as long as possible for the team. I did that for periods but not to the capability that I have done in the past.

""From that perspective I was disappointed but there was belief there that I was playing well and if I got an opportunity on a decent wicket then I can make a big one,"" he concluded.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://im.rediff.com/cricket/2023/mar/13virat-kohli.jpg,eng-8469535,0.003921568627450966,416408640,1,rediff.com,news,Rediff.com India Ltd.,Virat Kohli Test cricket Batting (cricket) India Australia national cricket team Ahmedabad Australia Innings Shreyas Iyer Wicket Nagpur,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,4,13,2023-03-13

Kohli got the monkey off his back after ending 1205 days Test century hiatus with his marathon 186-run knock against Australia in the fourth and final Test against Australia in Ahmedabad.

The former Indian skipper's 28th Test ton helped India post 571 in reply to Australia's 480 as the match ended in a draw. India clinched the four-match series 2-1 and retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Kohli endured a painful wait of more than three years to notch his Test century number 28, the knock helping India finish with 571 in reply to Australia's 480 in the drawn fourth and final game.

""The expectations that I have for myself as a player are more important to me,"" Kohli told the official broadcasters after being adjudged Player of the Match.

""I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field,"" said Kohli, who now has 75 international centuries.

""I think in Test cricket I wasn't able to play with my tempo and template that I have played with for the last 10 years for a while now. So that was the one thing I was trying to do.

""I felt like I was batting really well from the first innings in Nagpur.""

Kohli admitted he was not in his own in the Test format so he had to apply himself harder. Kohli faced 364 balls in his knock of 186 and scored only 60 runs in boundaries.

It was a deliberate ploy as India had a batter short in their XI after Shreyas Iyer pulled out because of a back injury.

""We lost Shreyas to injury and were a batter short. So, we decided to play time. We focused on batting long.

""We focussed more on batting as long as possible for the team. I did that for periods but not to the capability that I have done in the past.

""From that perspective I was disappointed but there was belief there that I was playing well and if I got an opportunity on a decent wicket then I can make a big one,"" he concluded.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_Match_awards_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Player of the Match awards (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=d83da287-0225-5a41-b8d8-2f4d68427c27&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.76792&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.11604,eng-8469535,0.07450980392156858,416410920,1,khaleejtimes.com,news,Khaleej times,Virat Kohli Test cricket India Australia Batting (cricket) Shubman Gill Ahmedabad Player of the Match awards (cricket) Innings Shreyas Iyer Wicket Nagpur,United-Arab-Emirates,AE,?,,Center,ChatGPT,C19,C9,Asia,AS,Muslim,44.0,50.0,146.0,38.0,78.0,32.0,22.0,22.0,26.0,47.0,33.0,42.0,119.0,74.0,36.0,52.0,66.0,22.0,22.0,?,?,?,?,Arab League,AL,Arabic-speaking,Ara,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,42,13,2023-03-13

The comments were made. The judgements were passed.

But he stood his ground. Heard it all. Didn't utter a word.

On Sunday, as Virat Kohli raised his bat after scoring a Test hundred after more than three years, there was a sense of satisfaction in his celebration. He didn't fly high or run around with the bat and helmet in his hands (what was usually his way of celebrating milestones)! He just stood and smiled, probably telling all those who questioned him, ""There's more to me than you thought!""

He knew this won't be his last ton. He didn't want it to look like something he was waiting desperately for. He kept it simple because he knows he is not done. He never was.

King Kohli roars back to form

After emerging as the modern-day batting icon, there was a sudden dip in Virat Kohli's form.

He wasn't able to hit those golden three-figure marks after making it a habit. A century drought made a lot of noise.

But he made his way through. He overcame it all. Being stuck on 70 centuries for almost three years, Kohli ended the drought in December 2022.

He fired his first T20 and overall 71st international century against Afghanistan in Asia Cup 2022. That is where his revival started.

Kohli soon followed it with an ODI ton against Bangladesh at the year-end and then two more in 2023 beginning. In the fourth Test against Australia, he finally scored a Test hundred as well after November 2019.

Kohli begins 2023 with a bang

In three months of 2023 now, Kohli already has three tons: two in ODIs and one in Tests, making his overall century number 75. If he kept going the way he is currently, he could also cross one of the significant records in cricket: Sachin Tendulkar's 100 international centuries.

And it won't be a surprise. Virat was always meant to do what people thought could never be done. No doubt, he might have fumbled a bit for a while, but his skills, temperament, attitude and work ethic set him apart from everyone else. The real Virat Kohli is well and truly here.

Even after his outings in the limited-overs format, the lack of runs in Tests was still considered the real deal. The barren patch got longer with the away series against Bangladesh and the home series vs Australia presented Kohli an opportunity to find the missing piece to his own puzzle. That of a century in T20I, a stellar T20 World Cup and then the consistency in ODIs.

From the practice sessions, there was no dearth of intent from India's prolific right-hander. He would take guard well before his teammates had finished warming up and didn't vacate the nets before the entire training gear was soaked in sweat. There were attempts to simulate match situation by creating the extra rough on practice surfaces, facing bowlers who create angles similar to Australian attack, continue showing the hunger to succeed and hope the hours in the nets translate into runs in the middle.

If Nagpur would have woken him up, he gave a stern reminder of his abilities during the masterful 44 in the Delhi Test. The energy seemed infectious after that game and he was at it ahead of the Indore Test. Sublime footwork, big hits against spin and a solid defence - all was on display over the two days he trained on the practice wickets but Indore came 'out of syllabus' for most batters. A minefield was rolled out and Kohli, like most, couldn't get the big digits. If he was trapped while defending off the front-foot in the first innings, where he did look solid, in the second it was the dangerous attempt to pull Matthew Kuhnemann on a surface where balls were scooting low.

Read | 'Virat Kohli century loading ...' Will the wait finally be over in Ahmedabad?

Three games without a big score but Kohli was getting there. He was looking very good in patches and the slightly open stance allowed him to smother the off-spinners towards the leg-side. And he clearly mastered that shot this series and enjoyed a lot of control and success with it. Ahmedabad rolled out a very true and batting-friendly surface and the way Australia batted in the first innings, there were runs in store for the India batters too.

Shubman Gill scored, Rohit Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara got starts but the next name on the scoresheet was the one everyone was interested in.

The 1205-day wait ended, the helmet finally came off and Kohli got the ""600kg gorilla"" off his back. His return to form was complete with authority and a daddy hundred. He would go on to say that there's nothing to ""prove someone wrong"" but this was one such moment where one wouldn't mind being proven wrong.

Read | The big numbers from the wait for elusive 28th Test ton

""I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field,"" Virat Kohli said in an interaction with the host broadcaster after getting the Player of the Match award for his gritty 186.

Kohli would add that the expectations he has from himself matter the most to him but runs instil a lot of confidence and inject a lot of positive energy in the change room. The former India captain was disappointed to not bat long in the previous fixtures and had a ""relief"" of sorts to play the way he did.

Social media | 'The wait has an inevitable end'

""To be honest, the expectations I have from myself as a player is more to important to me. I felt I was batting well from the first innings at Nagpur. We focussed on batting for long. I did that to an extent but not to the capability that I have done in the past.... I was a little disappointed for that. Relief from the point of view that I could play the way I wanted to play,"" Kohli said.

From a personal point of view, it's good for Kohli that he is back among the runs in all three formats after not reaching the magic figure for quite some time. But more than Kohli, this knock would do a world of good to the dressing room and lend a lot of confidence to the top-order which has struggled in the ongoing Test cycle.

Barring some crucial hands, the consistency at top has been missing and Kohli finding his mojo back is the only thing India would have wanted ahead of the World Test Championship (WTC) Final in June.

Was there a relief in the Indian camp after the much-awaited ton? Rohit downplayed the ""relief"" bit but was effusive in his praise for his former captain and was pleased with the manner in which the right-hander applied himself on the Day 3 and Day 4 wickets.

""Look, he played more than 100 Tests, got so many 100s, for a player like him, its few innings here and there. We saw in white ball cricket, we saw in Asia cup he scored that 100 and never looked back. I hope it will be same with red ball as well. It's about going out there and applying yourself and doing the same things, he did pretty well and he did his own things rather than worrying about the scoreboard and he just batted the way he bats usually and that's what got him success and to bat out so many balls is not easy on day 3 and 4 and some balls taking sharp turns and some balls having uneven bounce, that's typical Indian wicket, he batted, he got big score and he put us in a situation where we were,"" said Rohit during the post-series presser.

In context of this match and series, Kohli's runs mattered. Mattered a lot. But his return to form in whites ticks a very important box before Rohit Sharma & Co gear up for the title clash, against the same opposition, in England. No team would want to run into an in-form Kohli and Australia certainly know a thing or two about that proposition.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score':

Indian talismanic captain Rohit Sharma contradicted Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma's claim that Virat Kohli was batting through sickness on Day 4 of the fourth and final Test of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar series in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Sharma's Instagram story raised several eyebrows with Kohli fans expressing concern about his health.

Putting an end to his Test century drought, Kohli led India's batting onslaught, top-scoring for the side as the hosts toppled Australia's mammoth 1st innings total. India, riding on his blistering knock, posted a colossal total of 571 in the first session at Ahmedabad, forging a 91-run lead. The 34-year-old put on a batting masterclass to notch up a cracking century in 241 balls against Australia. His 75th international century was the second-slowest ton in his iconic career.

Axar Patel, when asked about Kohli's health status after stumps, stated, ""I don't know. The way he was running between the wickets, it didn't look like he was sick. In such hot weather, he forged a such a great partnership and ran so well. It was fun batting with him."" The reports concerning Kohli's health dwindled after he returned to the field throughout Day 5, which indicated that all was well with him.

However, Rohit was asked about Kohli's health during the post-match press conference. ""I don't think he is sick; he was just coughing a little bit, but I don't think it's that bad health wise,"" he said, putting an end to the speculations.

He also credited the former India captain for steering India to a commanding position in the fourth Test, even though the end result was a draw.

""Virat was the big reason behind the solid position of team in the 4th Test. I don't think there was any monkey of Virat Kohli's back.

Before the Border Gavaskar Trophy got underway, the Virat Kohli question was on every lip. Even after his outings in the limited-overs format, the lack of runs in Tests was still considered the real deal.

The barren patch got longer with the away series against Bangladesh and the home series vs Australia presented Kohli an opportunity to find the missing piece to his own puzzle. That of a century in T20I, a stellar T20 World cup and then the consistency in ODIs.

From the practice sessions, there was no dearth of intent from India's prolific right-hander. He would take guard well before his teammates had finished warming up and didn't vacate the nets before the entire training gear was soaked in sweat.

There were attempts to simulate match situations by creating the extra rough on practice surfaces, facing bowlers who create angles similar to the Australian attack, continue showing the hunger to succeed and hope the hours in the nets translate into runs in the middle.

If Nagpur would have woken him up, he gave a stern reminder of his abilities during the masterful 44 in the Delhi Test. The energy seemed infectious after that game and he was at it ahead of the Indore Test.

Sublime footwork, big hits against spin and a solid defence - all was on display over the two days he trained on the practice wickets but Indore came 'out of syllabus' for most batters. A minefield was rolled out and Kohli, like most, couldn't get the big digits. If he was trapped while defending off the front foot in the first innings, where he did look solid, in the second it was the dangerous attempt to pull Matthew Kuhnemann on a surface where balls were scooting low.

Three games without a big score but Kohli was getting there. He was looking very good in patches and the slightly open stance allowed him to smother the off-spinners towards the leg-side. And he clearly mastered that shot in this series and enjoyed a lot of control and success with it. Ahmedabad rolled out a very true and batting-friendly surface and the way Australia batted in the first innings, there were runs in store for the Indian batters too.

Shubman Gill scored, Rohit Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara got starts but the next name on the scoresheet was the one everyone was interested in.

The 1205-day wait ended, the helmet finally came off and Kohli got the ""600kg gorilla"" off his back. His return to form was complete with authority and a daddy hundred. He would go on to say that there's nothing to ""prove someone wrong"" but this was one such moment where one wouldn't mind being proven wrong.

""I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field,"" Virat Kohli said in an interaction with the host broadcaster after getting the Player of the Match award for his gritty 186.

Kohli would add that the expectations he has from himself matter the most to him but runs instil a lot of confidence and inject a lot of positive energy in the change room. The former India captain was disappointed to not bat long in the previous fixtures and had a ""relief"" of sorts to play the way he did.

""To be honest, the expectations I have from myself as a player is more to important to me. I felt I was batting well from the first innings at Nagpur. We focussed on batting for long. I did that to an extent but not to the capability that I have done in the past.... I was a little disappointed for that. Relief from the point of view that I could play the way I wanted to play,"" Kohli said.

From a personal point of view, it's good for Kohli that he is back among the runs in all three formats after not reaching the magic figure for quite some time. But more than Kohli, this knock would do a world of good to the dressing room and lend a lot of confidence to the top order which has struggled in the ongoing Test cycle.

Barring some crucial hands, the consistency at the top has been missing and Kohli finding his mojo back is the only thing India would have wanted ahead of the WTC Final in June.

Was there a relief in the Indian camp after the much-awaited ton? Rohit downplayed the ""relief"" bit but was effusive in his praise for his former captain and was pleased with the manner in which the right-hander applied himself on the Day 3 and Day 4 wickets.

""Look, he played more than 100 Tests, got so many 100s, for a player like him, its few innings here and there. We saw in white ball cricket, we saw in Asia cup he scored that 100 and never looked back. I hope it will be same with red ball as well. It's about going out there and applying yourself and doing the same things, he did pretty well and he did his own things rather than worrying about the scoreboard and he just batted the way he bats usually and that's what got him success and to bat out so many balls is not easy on day 3 and 4 and some balls taking sharp turns and some balls having uneven bounce, that's typical Indian wicket, he batted, he got big score and he put us in a situation where we were,"" said Rohit during the post-series presser.

In the context of this match and series, Kohli's runs mattered. Mattered a lot. But his return to form in whites ticks a very important box before Rohit Sharma & Co gear up for the title clash, against the same opposition, in England. No team would want to run into an in-form Kohli and Australia certainly know a thing or two about that proposition.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score':

Virat Kohli finally got his 28th Test century after a three-year wait. Three years, that's a long time in cricket. And the three years spanned 41 innings in 23 Tests. That's a surprise, given his stature as one of the modern greats.

Love him or loathe him, Kohli, at the peak of his powers, was arguably the best batsman in the world. Steve Smith ran him close, and the Australian continues to rake in runs and tons. Kane Williamson's consistency hasn't flagged, and more evidence was the century on Monday that lifted New Zealand to a last-ball win over Sri Lanka.

England's Joe Root could be the world's best Test batter on current form, and Pakistan's Babar Azam has broken into the exclusive club with a superb sequence of scoring spells. All this happened when centuries were hard to come by for the former Indian captain.

To Kohli, the 186 against Australia in Ahmedabad on Sunday meant a lot. That was apparent in the manner in which the Delhi batter constructed his innings, especially on the fourth day. Kohli eschewed risks to reach his ton that ensured India won't lose the fourth Test.

True, the Motera track was placid; three others scored centuries. But chasing 480 can be put the skids, and the innings could unravel quickly. Kohli's innings have to be seen in that context, especially since the 34-year-old came to bat when India were 187/2 -- 293 behind Australia.

Much of the innings was anchored in defence: from 59 to 102, Kohli didn't score a boundary. Little wonder, the 241-ball ton was his second slowest (after Nagpur, 2012), but it helped cast off another millstone around his neck. And this one took 40 months; his last Test ton was against Bangladesh in November 2019.

The Test century completes the revival of Kohli. Since September 2022, he has struck his maiden ton in T20s and two centuries in One-Day Internationals. Ahmedabad completes his circle of recovery. A recovery in terms of centuries because he's been scoring in white-ball cricket, although three figures remained elusive.

Since his maiden T20 century against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup in Dubai, Kohli didn't look back. The gutsy matchwinning knock of 82 not out in the Melbourne thriller against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup showed that Kohli's fighting qualities are intact. Centuries during the tour of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka's tour of India increased his tally of ODI tons to 46. Yet, a Test ton didn't materialise.

That made the Ahmedabad knock special. It was vintage Kohli. Good old-fashioned cricket with a straight blade, it burnished his Test match credentials. It was an innings full of character. One that proclaimed King Kohli was back. Long live the king!

India did claim a 2-1 series win against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, but the fourth Test - a draw in Ahmedabad - also marked a 75th international century for Virat Kohli. The 34-year-old's 28th Test ton on the fourth day of the match was his first Test century since November 2019.

The match was eventually drawn at stumps on the fifth day.

Expectations of the star batter have never dwindled despite the long wait for a century, but he asserted that the yardsticks he has set for himself are the ones that matter most to him.

""To be honest, the expectations that I have from myself as a player, they are more important to me. In Test cricket I wasn't able to play with my tempo and the template that I have played with for the last 10 years for a while now. So that was the one thing that I was trying to do,"" he said in the post-match presentation after being named the player of the match.

""We focus more on trying to bat for as long as possible and trying to get the important runs for the team. I did that on a few occasions but not to the capabilities that I have and what I have done in the past. From that perspective I was a bit disappointed, but there was a belief there that I was playing well and if I get an opportunity on a decent wicket then I can get a big one.""

Despite Kohli's high standards and demands from himself, there was a shortage of runs in the first three matches. In the opener in Nagpur, he scored 12. In New Delhi, he scored 44 and 20 in the second Test, followed by 22 and 13 in Indore. At Ahmedabad though, Kohli martialled the Indian innings, aided by Shubhman Gill's 128, to top score with 186.

""(There was) relief from the point of view that I could play the way that I wanted to play, and I was patient enough and I wasn't getting desperate out there at all. I was happy with my defence and the way I was going, with the tempo I was going with. There wasn't relief from an achievements perspective - I'm not in a space where I necessarily need to go out there and prove someone wrong,"" he said.

""People do have that belief in me because I have done it for a while, but I need to do that as well to justify me being here on the field as well. It's part of playing sport. From all those perspectives, I'm happy that I was able to do it for the team and get the runs that were required.""

His solid knock came on the back of 364 deliveries, a patient innings laced with 15 boundaries. Yet the tempo of his innings was by design.

""When I was 60 not out, we did think about playing positively the next day, but unfortunately we lost Shreyas Iyer to injury and he could not bat, so we were a batter less. The plan was to just bat time and make sure the opposition doesn't sneak into the game, because they are very good at doing that - finding opportunities and getting into the game,"" he added.

""I was happy with the tempo because of those reasons. The way the innings went, I felt they put some very nice fields and they were very consistent with the ball. They were not providing many boundary balls to me at all, and I didn't want to create any because we were a batter short and that would have meant we were just trying to make ends meet. In the end we got the result, from the batting point of view, that's what we wanted. We got the lead and gave ourselves a little bit of a chance, so everything went along with the plan.""

Australia had won the toss and opted to bat. The visitors put on an impressive 480 on the board in the first innings - courtesy Usman Khawaja's 180 and Cameron Green's 114. India however replied with 571 with Kohli and Gill starring with the bat. Australia then came out to bat again and managed 175/2 at stumps on Day 5 to end the match in a tie.

The Australians will stay on in India to compete in the three-match One-Day International Series, starting with the first match at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on March 17.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Stump (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shubman Gill'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'New Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'New Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Khawaja', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Usman Khawaja'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wankhede Stadium'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Toss (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mumbai'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Mumbai'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/187917-sxarrjrquk-1678712445.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1372549019607843,416418420,1,scroll.in,news,Scroll.in,Test cricket Virat Kohli Ahmedabad India Border–Gavaskar Trophy Innings Cricket bat Batting (cricket) Australia Stump (cricket) Wicket Shubman Gill Indore Nagpur New Delhi Usman Khawaja Wankhede Stadium Australia national cricket team Toss (cricket) Shreyas Iyer One Day International Mumbai,India,IN,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,13,47,15,2023-03-13

The four-match Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) Test series came to an end on Monday (March 13) with the final Test ending in a tame draw in Ahmedabad as India won the series 2-1. The series ended on a positive note with no untoward incidents between the two sides. Former India captain Virat Kohli, who has had a 'love-hate' relationship with the Australian crowds, extended a friendly hand to the Australian players after the end of the Test series.

Kohli gifted his jerseys to Australian cricketers Usman Khawaja and Alex Carey after the fourth Test ended in a draw on Monday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) posted a video of Kohli gifting his jersey.

Kohli also apparently gifted one of his bats to Marnus Labuschagne, according to one of the travelling Australian media. Kohli, who ended his century drought in Tests with a patient 186 against Australia in Ahmedeabad, on Monday said he's not in a 'space where I will go out and prove someone wrong'.

The Indian batter endured a painful wait of more than three years to notch his Test century number 28, the knock helping India finish with 571 in reply to Australia's 480 in the drawn fourth and final game. ""The expectations that I have for myself as a player are more important to me,"" Kohli told the official broadcasters after being adjudged Player of the Match.

""I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field,"" Kohli, who now has 75 international centuries, said.

""I think in Test cricket I wasn't able to play with my tempo and template that I have played with for the last 10 years for awhile now. So that was the one thing I was trying to do. I felt like I was batting really well from the first innings in Nagpur.""

Kohli admitted he was not in his own in the Test format so he had to apply himself harder. Kohli faced 364 balls in his knock of 186 and scored only 60 runs in boundaries. It was a deliberate ploy as India had a batter short in their XI after Shreyas Iyer pulled out because of a back injury.

Kohli slammed a 186-run knock and was named 'Player of the Match' as the game ended in a draw. India won the series 2-1 and also qualified for the World Test Championship (WTC) final, after New Zealand defeated Sri Lanka in the first Test at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Monday.

During Kohli's lean patch with the bat, some questions were raised over his place in the team.

After the conclusion of the match, Kohli opened up on his knock, saying that he was trying to ""justify"" his place in the team.

""To be honest, the expectations I have from myself as a player is more to important to me. I felt I was batting well from the first innings at Nagpur. We focused on batting for long. I did that to an extent but not to the capability that I have done in the past. Was a little disappointed for that. Relief from the point of view that I could play the way I wanted to play. I was happy with my defence. Now I am not in a space where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field,"" Kohli said at the presentation ceremony.

Speaking on his 163-run stand with Axar Patel, Kohli said that the pair decided to take their time in the middle as they were a player short in the batting department, due to Shreyas Iyer's injury.

""When I was 60 not out, we decided to play positively. But we lost Shreyas to injury and were a batter short. So, we decided to play time. They were good with the ball and placed some good fields. We got a bit of a lead and gave ourselves some sort of a chance,"" he added.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagley_Oval', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hagley Oval'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Christchurch'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Christchurch'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Shreyas Iyer'}}]","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-03/8t8ns0g_virat-kohli-afp_625x300_13_March_23.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=675",eng-8469535,0.1450980392156862,416457000,1,sports.ndtv.com,news,NDTVSports.com,Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) Test cricket India Hagley Oval ICC World Test Championship Australia national cricket team Ahmedabad Sri Lanka Innings Cricket bat Christchurch Nagpur Axar Patel Shreyas Iyer,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,30,2,2023-03-14

The bat continued to hold sway with Australia declaring their second innings at 175 for 2. The declaration came 10 minutes and two overs before the final hour. Both captains then decided to call off the match.

Opener Travis Head (90) and his overnight partner Matthew Kuhnemann (6) were the two batsmen dismissed. The former was cleaned up by Axar Patel and the latter was leg-before to R Ashwin, who took his seriesâ€™ tally of wickets to 25.

Marnus Labuschagne belatedly, helped himself to his first fifty of the series (63). He and stand-in skipper Steve Smith (10) were the not out batsmen. There was hardly any interest left in the match once news broke about India qualifying for the World Test Championship Final after New Zealand beat Sri Lanka by two wickets off the last ball of the Test in Christchurch.

The rest of the final dayâ€™s play resembled more than anything the fourth day of a domestic match with nothing at stake. There were more security personnel patrolling the Narendra Modi Stadium than fans.

That said, there were many takeaways from the 2-1 series win for India. The biggest plus was Virat Kohli scoring his long overdue 28th Test ton. The premier India batsman showed great powers of concentration to bat for 516 minutes for his 186 in testing conditions to help his team take the first-innings lead.

Kohli, after scoring two back-toback hundreds in the ODIs against Sri Lanka earlier this year, and now a Test hundred, appears to have got into the habit of scoring centuries again. It augurs well for India as they eye the WTC crown and the ODI World Cup at home later this year.

â€œI donâ€™t think there was any monkey on his back. When you are around a player like that, and when you see how they go about their business, you donâ€™t feel that kind of thing going in his head,â€ said captain Rohit Sharma about Kohli finally breaking his more three-year Test century drought.

â€œHe has played more than hundred Tests now. Heâ€™s got so many runs, so many hundreds. So, for a player like him, it is about a few innings here and there. We saw that in white-ball cricket as well. From Asia Cup, when he got that hundred (against Afghanistan), he never looked back. And I hope it is going to be the same with the red ball as well,â€ Sharma said.

Another performance that would have gladdened the team is the quality shown by Shubman Gill.

The 23-year-old has answered the doubting Thomases by scoring a classic 128 after almost spending two days in the sun chasing leather.

â€œItâ€™s been a really exciting 4-5 months for Shubman, just breaking into the T20I side and scoring a hundred. Doing the same in Oneday cricket and then capping that off with good performances in the last two Tests. It is really exciting for a young player to come through,â€ said coach Rahul Dravid.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng':

At the start of the video, Rahul Dravid took a cheeky jibe at Kohli by saying that he had to wait sixteen months to watch his Test century from the comfort of the dressing room.

""You made me wait for a long time since I became the coach. But what a beauty and it was an absolute privilege to watch the way you constructed your innings,"" said Dravid.

When asked about what was his mindset and how he constructed his innings during his marathon knock of 186, Kohli admitted it was a good surface to bat on.

""Thanks for your kind words Rahul bhai. As far as approaching this inning is concerned. I knew that I was playing well even in the test matches before we played this one. To be fair, it was a really good wicket to bat on,"" said Kohli.

""But having said that I think the Australian whatever the little help was there in the wicket I think they utilised it really well. Their consistency to bowl in the little rough was created through Mitchell Starc's bowling for Nathan Lyon and the other off-spinner (Todd Murphy) as well. They capitalised on it really well. The fact that they put 7-2 field most of the time for me. It meant that I have to be patient and trust my defence and that's the template I have already played with in Test cricket,"" said Kohli, who ended his three years century drought in Test cricket.

Kohli also spoke about why defence is one of his strongest suits and how it helped him to construct an inning in Test cricket.

""My defence is my strongest point because when I defend well I know that when the ball is loose and when it's there to hit I can cash in and get the runs I need,"" he said.

""The boundaries were not easy to come by, to be honest. The outfield was slow, the ball was soft and they were pretty consistent. One that really calmed me down as I am happy to just run ones and twos and score a hundred,"" he added.

Kohli got to his 75th international hundred off 241 balls, including five fours. It was Kohli's second-slowest Test hundred in terms of balls faced.

Kohli credits his fitness to being able to bat that long.

""I can bat four sessions, I can bat five sessions, that's where the fitness and physical preparation comes into play for me. I go into the field to relax because I know I can bat in many ways. I am not desperate if I play three sessions and feel like I am breaking down and I need to get fast runs otherwise I won't be able to stay there for long,"" he said.

""I think for people who must have seen it or we have watched you guys bat so many times in the past as well. One thing that stood out was batting fitness which was to be able to bat five sessions and six sessions and I think for that you need to physically prepare yourself, that's where the mindset comes from.""

At one point in his knock, he had faced 162 deliveries without hitting a boundary, but the batter was unfazed about it and said he is happy to not score a single boundary in a session.

Even before he reached halfway through the other end, the crowd at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad resorted to thunderous cheers and applause. The social media frenzies quickly hit the 'tweet' button. Their drafted tweets on a Virat Kohli Test hundred finally landed on the timeline. Aware of all this, in his subconscious mind, Kohli quietly took his helmet off, kissed his engagement ring dangling on a locket and raised his bat. It was not a celebration that justified the wait of more than 1200 days, 24 Tests and 42 innings for a hundred in the toughest format of the game. Or in a way it did.

When you are Virat Kohli, not scoring a century for more than three years in the format you rate as the best is bound to play on your mind. Add to that the discomfort of your average plummeting to a never-before-seen low of 29 with only six half-centuries in 24 Tests since December 2019, it becomes almost impossible to bear. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri put it aptly by saying a ""600kg gorilla is off his back now"" when Kohli reached the three-figure mark on Day 4 of the fourth Test against Australia.

The new decade has not been the best for Virat. He has seen lows he perhaps would never have imagined as a batter. But every time, he has bounced back, in every format and in every situation. By ending his century drought in Test cricket, he completed the cycle.

The fact that Kohli's mammoth 186-run knock also ensured Team India surpassed Australia's first innings total of 480 and took a lead to put the pressure back on them, would give more satisfaction to Kohli.

After the fourth Test ended in a draw with India winning the four-match series 2-1 to take the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the fourth time in a row, former India captain and current head coach Rahul Dravid asked Kohli about his feelings of not being able to score a century for such long time in red-ball cricket.

""I know you are someone who takes a lot of pride in his performance and has that habit of scoring 100 regularly. I know there was COVID, so, not a lot of Test matches but has it been hard not to have scored a Test hundred (for this long)? I know we get a little obsessed with numbers. I've loved seeing some of the other innings. Even the 70 in Cape Town was a really good innings. But has (not scoring a hundred) been at the back of your mind?"" Dravid asked in an interview for BCCI.tv.

Kohli, who has been batting well in the entire series without a big score till the fourth Test, said he is never happy with the 40s or 50s.

""Honestly, I've let the complications grow on me a bit because of my shortcomings. The desperation to get to the three-figure mark is something that can grow on you as a batsman. I let that happen to me to a certain extent. But a flip side to it is, I'm not a guy who is happy with 40-45. I take a lot of pride in performing for the team. It's not like when Virat Kohli should stand out. When I'm batting on 40, I know I can get a 150. That was eating me up a lot. Why am I not able to get that big score for the team? Because I took pride in the fact that when the team needed me, I stood up, scoring in difficult conditions. The fact that I wasn't able to do that, was bothering me,"" He said.

It was Kohli's 28th Test hundred, 75th overall and 14th at home that took him past Virender Sehwag, Dilip Vengsarkar and Mohammad Azharuddin. But Kohli said it is never about the milestone.

""It was never about the milestones. A lot of people ask me, 'how do you keep scoring those hundreds'. And I always say a hundred is something that happens along the way within my goal, which is to bat as long as possible for my team. But yeah, if I'm brutally honest, it does become a little difficult as the moment you step out of the hotel room, right from the guy outside, to the guy in the lift, the bus driver everyone is saying 'we want a hundred'. So, it does play on your mind all the time but that's also the beauty of playing for so long to have these complications come up and overcome these challenges,"" he said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravi Shastri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rahul Dravid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'First-class cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilip_Vengsarkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Dilip Vengsarkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virender_Sehwag', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Virender Sehwag'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Azharuddin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mohammad Azharuddin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cape Town'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Cape Town'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'South Africa'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/14/1600x900/ANI-20230303062-0_1678765443624_1678765443624_1678765471984_1678765471984.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1294117647058823,416461860,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Innings Virat Kohli Test cricket India Ravi Shastri Nathan Lyon Narendra Modi Stadium Rahul Dravid Century (cricket) Cricket bat Batting (cricket) Twitter Ahmedabad Border–Gavaskar Trophy Australia national cricket team First-class cricket India national cricket team Captain (cricket) Cricket Australia Dilip Vengsarkar Virender Sehwag Mohammad Azharuddin Cape Town New Zealand,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,51,3,2023-03-14

Indian star batter Virat Kohli, who ended his century drought in Tests with a patient 186 against Australia here, on Monday said he's not in a ""space where I will go out and prove someone wrong"".

Kohli endured a painful wait of more than three years to notch his Test century number 28, the knock helping India finish with 571 in reply to Australia's 480 in the drawn fourth and final game.

""The expectations that I have for myself as a player are more important to me,"" Kohli told the official broadcasters after being adjudged Player of the Match.

""I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field,"" Kohli, who now has 75 international centuries, said.

Kohli admitted he was not in his own in the Test format so he had to apply himself harder. He played 386 balls in his knock.

His last ton in the longest format of the game had come in November 2019 against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens in what was India's first-ever pink-ball Test. With the ton, Kohli finished the series as India's top scorer, jumping past Axar Patel and captain Rohit Sharma.

Former Australia opener Mark Waugh said on Fox Cricket that Kohli seemed set to score a century right from the time he walked out to bat on Day 3. Kohli had to see off a tricky last over of the second session from Nathan Lyon on Saturday with Cheteshwar Pujara right at the stroke of Tea.

""The drought's over. The gates have opened,"" said Waugh. ""You could tell right from the get-go he meant business. He played very few risky shots. He was so patient, just picked the bowling off."" Waugh, who had caused a flutter when he heavily criticised Kohli for his slip catching technique while being part of the commentary team in the series for the first two Tests, said that he feels Kohli is not back to the kind of level he was at when he was at his peak before 2019 and yet he performed this well. ""I don't think he's at his pure best at the moment, as far as his Test career is concerned ... but it just shows you his class,"" he said.

Kohli was awarded player of the match for the knock. He said that he was happy to have done what the team needed him to do but he was not keen on proving anything by ending the century drought.

""The expectations that I have for myself as a player are more important to me. I think in Test cricket I wasn't able to play with my tempo and template that I have played with for the last 10 years for a while now. So that was the one thing I was trying to do. I felt like I was batting really well from the first innings in Nagpur. But we focussed more on batting as long as possible for the team.

Virat Kohli reached triple figures for the first time in 41 innings and a more than three years wait. Kohli scored 186 runs, his 28th Test hundred in the fourth and final Test match of the Border-Gavaskar series.

""If I will have to be brutally honest, it does become a little complicated and difficult because the moment you step out of the hotel room, right from the guy outside the room to the guy in the lift to the bus drivers, everyone was saying 'we want a hundred.' So it does play on your mind all the time,"" Virat Kohli told Rahul Dravid in an interview on BCCI.TV.

""But that's the beauty of playing cricket for so long as well, to have these complications and to overcome these challenges and then it comes together nicely as it did in this game, then that gives you the extra confidence to go beyond and go further and start enjoying the cricket a lot more,"" he added.

Kohli said the century came at the right time, just before the World Test Championship (WTC) final, which is scheduled to be held at the Oval from June 7 to 11.

""I am happy that it came at the right time just before the WTC final, and I will definitely be going there very relaxed and very excited,"" he said.

Kohli also explained more than getting to the three-figure mark it was his own performance that was eating him up from the inside.

""To be honest, I have led the complications to grow on me a little bit because of my own shortcomings. I think the desperation to get that three-figure mark is something that can grow on you as a batsman we have all experienced that in some stage or the other,"" he said.

""I led that happen to me to a certain extent but also, the flip side to it is that I am not a guy who is happy with forty and forty-five. I have always been someone who takes a lot of pride in performing for the team.

""It's not like Virat Kohli should stand out. It's like when I am batting on 40 I know I can get a 150 here and that would help my team so that was eating me a lot.

'Monkey is Off His Back', a phrase used quite freely when Virat Kohli peeled off his 28th Test century during the 4th Test between India and Australia in Ahmedabad. Former India coach and popular commentator Ravi Shastri took it up a step while on-air as he replaced 'monkey' with 'gorilla' in that phrase while underlining the significance of Kohli's first Test century in over three years.

What the expression signifies is that Kohli was seemingly bogged down by his repeated failures to score a hundred in red-ball cricket with his last such score before Ahmedabad coming way back in November 2019. However, India captain Rohit Sharma feels otherwise.

""I don't think there was any monkey on Virat's back,"" Rohit told reporters on Monday. ""When you are around a player like that and see how they go about their business, you don't feel that kind of thing going in his head. He's just enjoying his cricket at the moment, which you can see. Obviously, he wants to put up big performances for the team which he has done in the past so many years. He just wants to do that every time he plays for India.""

The century was Kohli's first in Test cricket after 41 innings. Since November 2019, he hadn't scored a century across formats till the 2022 Asia Cup in UAE when he slammed a maiden century in T20Is and then last December, scored a hundred in ODIs as well, his first such score in the format since August 2019.

Rohit praised the way Kohli constructed his innings during the drawn Ahmedabad Test as he made 186.

""Look, he (Kohli) has played more than 100 Tests, got so many hundreds, for a player like him, it's few innings here and there. We saw in white-ball cricket, we saw in Asia Cup, he scored that 100 and never looked back. I hope it will be same with red ball as well,"" Rohit said.

He continued, It's about going out there and applying yourself and doing the same things, he did pretty well and he did his own things rather than worrying about the scoreboard and he just batted the way he bats usually and that's what got him success and to bat out so many balls is not easy on Day 3 and 4. Some balls taking sharp turns and some having uneven bounce, that's typical Indian wicket. He got a big score and (took) us in a situation where we were.""

After Kohli's marathon innings, his wife Anushka Sharma put out a story on Instagram suggesting the batter had been battling sickness.

Sportzpics

The Ahmedabad Test may have ended in a draw, but India won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2-1, resulting in the Rohit Sharma-led squad reaching the finals of the World Test Championship. Another reason for Indian fans to cheer was Virat Kohli's roaring return to form in Tests. The former Men in Blue skipper ended his century drought with a 186-run knock against Australia.

Well, now there is one more reason for fans to cheer up. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has dropped a video of a post-match interview between Virat Kohli and India head coach Rahul Dravid. The duo, who are known for their strong bond, talk about a lot of subjects in the video, including Kohli's return to form and his ability to play based on what the team needs.

The conversation begins with Rahul Dravid talking about Kohli's comeback in Tests. The India coach joked that he had been desperate to watch Kohli score a Test hundred and enjoy it from the comfort of the team's dressing room. Dravid said that while he had to wait a long time for the sight ""but it was worth the wait"".

The duo also talked about Kohli's approach to the innings and the challenges he faced. Admitting that Australia utilised the pitch well, Kohli said that he was able to score because his defence is his strongest point. ""If I defend well then I know that when the ball is loose and ready to hit, I can cash in on it and get some runs. I am confident when I go to the field because I know I can bat in different ways,"" Kohli said.

The right-handed batter also said that he was happy batting five-six sessions and scoring singles and doubles to reach a hundred rather than getting desperate about scoring boundaries.

Dravid was full of praise for Kohli's dedication to the game and his lifestyle, calling him an inspiration. ""The lifestyle that you have chosen to lead is an inspiration not just to people in the dressing room but to others as well"". He also lauded Kohli's willingness to play according to his team's needs.

In the full interview shared on the BCCI's website, Kohli opened up about his below-par form in Tests. ""I think I let it grow on me a little bit due to my own shortcomings. The desperation to get a century can grow on any player and we have all experienced that. I let it happen to me to a certain extent. The flip side is that I am not happy scoring 40 or 50 runs. I always take pride in performing well for the team. I knew that if I could score 50, I could go up to 150 runs and help my team. The fact that I was not able to do that was eating me up a lot"", Kohli said.

The India star added that he was happy I could come out of the situation right before the World Test Championship final and he would be pretty relaxed now before the summit clash.

The biggest chunk of the last three years wasn't the most pleasant in Kohli's career, with the batter struggling to score big runs in all three formats of the game. However, Kohli's will to bounce back paid off and in a matter of months he has multiple centuries in all three formats of the game. However, joining India's head coach Rahul Dravid for a chat after the conclusion of the Ahmedabad Test, Kohli was asked if the century drought in Tests was 'hard' for him. The batter gave a 'brutally honest' response.

In a video shared by BCCI.TV, Dravid asked Kohli if it was 'hard' for him to have not scored a Test century for such a long period.

In response, Virat said: ""To be honest, I've led the complications to grow on me a little bit because of my own shortcomings. I think the desperation to get the 3-figure mark is something that can grow on you as a batsman. We've all experienced that at some stage or the other. I think I led that happen to me to a certain extent.""

""But also the flip side to it is that I am not a guy who is happy with 40 or 45 runs. I am someone who always takes pride in performing for the team. It's not like Virat Kohli should stand out. When I am batting on 40, I know I can get a 150 here and that will help my team. That was eating me up a lot. Why am I not able to get that big score for the team because I always took the pride in performing for the team when it needed me, in difficult conditions and difficult situations,"" he added.

Kohli then gave a 'brutally honest' explanation and said that it wasn't the fact that he was not able to score a hundred that bothered him but the case where he couldn't help the team with the bat as much as he had been.

""The fact that I wasn't able to do that was bother me. Not so much the milestone as such as I don't play for it. A lot of people ask me this question, 'how do you keep scoring a hundred?'. I always told them, a hundred is something that happens along the way within my goal which is to bat as long as possible for the team and get as many runs as possible. So, the milestone is never my focus. But yes, I have to be brutally honest, i does become a little complicated because the moment you step out of the hotel room, right from the guy outside the room to the guy in the lift to the bus driver, everyone is saying we want a hundred. So, it's like, it does play on your mind,"" he asserted.

Towards the end of the chat, the 34-year-old said that he is happy to have gotten the monkey off his back before the World Test Championship final.

""But I think that's the beauty of playing so long as well, to have these complications come and over come these challenges.

India's star batter Virat Kohli has admitted that not being able to make any substantial contribution to team India's cause for a long time was ""eating him up"" and he let the expectations overwhelm him a bit because he was desperate to score a big Test hundred.

Kohli hit a splendid 186 against Australia in the drawn fourth Test, ending a three-year wait to get his 28th Test century.

In a conversation with head coach Rahul Dravid, the 34-year old Kohli revealed that the weight of expectations became a bit tough to handle for him.

""Honestly, I've let the complications grow on me a bit because of my shortcomings,"" Kohli told Dravid in the chat, the video of which was posted by the BCCI on its website.

""The desperation to get to the three-figure mark is something that can grow on you as a batsman. I let that happen to me to a certain extent. But a flip side to it is, I'm not a guy who is happy with 40-45. I take a lot of pride in performing for the team.""

""It's not like when Virat Kohli should stand out. When I'm batting on 40, I know I can get a 150. That was eating me up a lot.""

""Why am I not able to get that big score for the team? Because I took pride in the fact that when the team needed me, I stood up, scoring in difficult conditions. The fact that I wasn't able to do that, was bothering me,"" he added.

Asked by Dravid how tough it was, Kohli said, ""If I've to be brutally honest, it does become a little difficult as the moment you step out of the hotel room, right from the guy outside, to the guy in the lift, the bus driver everyone is saying 'we want a hundred'.""

""So, it does play on your mind all the time but that's also the beauty of playing for so long to have these complications come up and overcome these challenges,"" Kohli said.

Kohli dished out an uncharacteristic 364-ball innings, spanning more than eight hours and 30 minutes. It was his 75th international century across formats.

Dravid said he was also desperate to see former skipper score that big hundred but it was worth in the end since Kohli delivered a master class.

""I've seen him as a player, seen a lot of hundreds of him on TV and after I took over the coach about 15-16 months ago, was a bit desperate to see him score a Test hundred and really enjoy it from the comfort of the dressing room""

""To be able to enjoy and relax a Test hundred. It was a beauty. You made me wait a long time but it was an absolute privilege to watch an innings and the way you constructed it,"" said Dravid.

Before this match, Kohli's last Test century had come in India's maiden Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in November 2019.

Kohli insisted that he never ""about the milestones"".

""A lot of people ask me, 'how do you keep scoring those hundreds'. And I always say a hundred is something that happens along the way within my goal, which is to bat as long as possible for my team.""

Kohli credited his fitness to be able to bat in different ways which help him excel in all formats.

""I can bat four sessions, I can bat five sessions, that's where the fitness and physical preparation comes into play for me.""

""I go into the field relaxed because I know I can bat in many ways. I am not desperate if I play three sessions and feel like I am breaking down and I need to get fast runs otherwise I won't be able to stay out there for long,"" he said.

"".....I am pretty happy scoring 30 runs in a session and not hitting a boundary and absolutely not be desperate because I know that boundaries will come and even if I have to play like this I can bat six sessions and get a 150.

It was Kohli's 75th international century overall, helping him pull farther away from Australia great Ricky Ponting as the second highest century scorer in the history of international cricket and inching him closer to Sachin Tendulkar's extraoardinary record of 100 centuries.

Much of the early part of Kohli's career, particularly in the years before and immediately after Tendulkar retired, was marked by comparisons between the two players. While it was always widely acknowledged that Tendulkar and Kohli were different kinds of batters, it was the prolific manner in which the latter accumulated runs that led to the comparisons.

They eventually died out as Kohli started beating his own path as India's captain and later, when the rush of runs and centuries came to an abrupt halt after 2019. Kohli's last Test century in November 2019 was also his only international century until September 2022, when he scored his first ever T20I century. Since then, he went on a run of three ODI centuries in four matches and finally crossed over into three figures in Test cricket this week.

Former Australia spinner Brad Hogg has stated that comparisons between Tendulkar and Kohli are invalidated even more now considering Kohli's trajectory over the past three years which included him dealing with the challenges that came with the Covid-19 pandemic and the rather tumultous end to his captaincy in limited overs cricket.

""Hopefully, we see the best of Kohli again. I think that there was too much pressure on Kohli in the last 2-3 years. The COVID, captaincy, and more cricket being played,"" said Hogg on his Youtube channel. ""Don't compare him with Sachin Tendulkar, because he was able to play more Test matches, and did not have to play IPL for the most part of his career. I also think he is going to make a big one in the WTC Final as well.""

Considered by many as the greatest batter of all time alongwith Australia legend Don Bradman, Tendulkar scored 15,921 runs in 200 Test matches at an average of 53.78 with 51 centuries. In ODIs, he scored 18,426 runs at an average of 44.83 in 463 matches with 49 centuries. Tendulkar only played one T20 international, in which he got out for 10 runs but captained Mumbai Indians in the initial years of the IPL. He played 96 T20 games, scoring 2797 runs at an average of 32.90 and strike rate of 121.08 with one century.

On the other hand, Kohli has played scored 8416 runs in 108 Test matches at an average of 48.93 with 28 centuries. In ODIs, he has scored a 12,809 runs in 271 matches at an averge of 57.69 with 46 centuries. Kohli has played 115 T20Is for India, scoring 4008 runs at an average of 52.73 and strike rate of 137.96.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ricky Ponting'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hogg', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Brad Hogg'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Limited overs cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mumbai Indians'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Strike rate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bradman', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Don Bradman'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/14/1600x900/kohli_tendulkar_1678779424182_1678779438322_1678779438322.jpg,eng-8469535,0.003921568627450966,416476680,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Virat Kohli Sachin Tendulkar Test cricket Australia Captain (cricket) India Ricky Ponting Cricket Brad Hogg Spin bowling Limited overs cricket One Day International Twenty20 International Coronavirus Mumbai Indians Strike rate Don Bradman Batting (cricket) Twenty20,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,58,7,2023-03-14

It's not easy being Virat Kohli. He's widely regarded as one of the finest batters to have played the game, arguably the greatest across formats of the current era, but to be the player he has become today, it's taken a lot of self-discipline overcoming unique challenges including the weight of expectations to score big every time he steps out to bat for India.

In Ahmedabad against Australia, Kohli ended his wait for a Test century with a fine 186 to put India in control. It was his first hundred in the format after November 2019 and for his superlative effort, he was also chosen as player-of-the-match.

In a chat with head coach Rahul Dravid after the fourth Test ended on Monday, Kohli revealed how everyone he comes across before during matchday expects him to score a hundred and that does play on his mind.

""If I have to be brutally honest, it does become a little complicated and difficult because the moment you step out of the hotel room, right from the guy outside the room to the guy in the lift to the bus drivers, everyone wants says 'we want a hundred.' So it does play on your mind all the time,"" Kohli told Dravid in an interview on Bcci.tv.

""But that's the beauty of playing cricket for so long as well, to have these complications come up and to overcome these challenges and then it comes together nicely like it did in this game, then that gives you an extra gust of air to go beyond and further and start enjoying the cricket a lot more,"" he added.

For India and Kohli the century has come at the right time. In a couple of months time, they will be traveling to England for the final of the ICC World Test Championship where they face Australia.

""I am just happy that it happened at the right time just before the World Test Championship final, and I will definitely be going there very relaxed and very excited man,"" Kohli said.

It took Kohli 41 innings between scoring his 27th and 28th Test century and he admits to have gotten a little frustrated during that period.

""To be honest, I have led the complications to grow on me a little bit because of my own shortcomings. I think the desperation to get that three-figure mark is something that can grow on you as a batsman and we have all experienced that in some stage or the other,"" he said.

Kohli recalled how he was questioning himself after repeated failures to not being able to stitch big innings despite having done so frequently in the past.

""I led that happen to me to a certain extent but also the flip side to it is that I am not a guy who is happy with forty and forty-fives. I have always been someone who takes a lot of pride in performing for the team. It's not like Virat Kohli should stand out. It's like when I am batting on 40 I know I can get a 150 here and that will help my team. So that was eating me a lot: Why I am not able to get that big score for the team is because I always took pride in the fact that when the team needed me I would step up and perform in different conditions and situations. The fact that I was not able to do that bothered me,"" he said.

With 75 centuries, Kohli is second on the list of players with most number of international centuries but the former India captain says personal milestones have never been a goal of his.

'King' Kohli came up with a knock of 186, his 28th Test century that took three year and three months to come, and it led India's solid reply to Australia's 480 with a total of 571, which also included a century by Shubman Gill.

However, the Test ended in a draw on the fifth day, giving India a 2-1 series victory.

In a conversation with head coach Rahul Dravid, the 34-year old Kohli revealed that the weight of expectations became a bit tough to handle for him.

""Honestly, I've let the complications grow on me a bit because of my shortcomings,"" Kohli told Dravid in the chat, the video of which was posted by the BCCI on its website.

""The desperation to get to the three-figure mark is something that can grow on you as a batsman. I let that happen to me to a certain extent. But a flip side to it is, I'm not a guy who is happy with 40-45. I take a lot of pride in performing for the team.

""It's not like when Virat Kohli should stand out. When I'm batting on 40, I know I can get a 150. That was eating me up a lot.

""Why am I not able to get that big score for the team? Because I took pride in the fact that when the team needed me, I stood up, scoring in difficult conditions. The fact that I wasn't able to do that, was bothering me,"" he added.

Asked by Dravid how tough it was, Kohli said, ""If I've to be brutally honest, it does become a little difficult as the moment you step out of the hotel room, right from the guy outside, to the guy in the lift, the bus driver everyone is saying 'we want a hundred'.

""So, it does play on your mind all the time but that's also the beauty of playing for so long to have these complications come up and overcome these challenges,"" Kohli said.

Kohli dished out an uncharacteristic 364-ball innings, spanning more than eight hours and 30 minutes. It was his 75th international century across formats.

Dravid said he was also desperate to see former skipper score that big hundred but it was worth in the end since Kohli delivered a master class.

""I've seen him as a player, seen a lot of hundreds of him on TV and after I took over the coach about 15-16 months ago, was a bit desperate to see him score a Test hundred and really enjoy it from the comfort of the dressing room

""To be able to enjoy and relax a Test hundred. It was a beauty. You made me wait a long time but it was an absolute privilege to watch an innings and the way you constructed it,"" said Dravid.

Before this match, Kohli's last Test century had come in India's maiden Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in November 2019.

Kohli insisted that he never ""about the milestones"".

""A lot of people ask me, 'how do you keep scoring those hundreds'. And I always say a hundred is something that happens along the way within my goal, which is to bat as long as possible for my team.""

Kohli credited his fitness to be able to bat in different ways which help him excel in all formats.

""I can bat four sessions, I can bat five sessions, that's where the fitness and physical preparation comes into play for me.

""I go into the field relaxed because I know I can bat in many ways. I am not desperate if I play three sessions and feel like I am breaking down and I need to get fast runs otherwise I won't be able to stay out there for long,"" he said.

"".....I am pretty happy scoring 30 runs in a session and not hitting a boundary and absolutely not be desperate because I know that boundaries will come and even if I have to play like this I can bat six sessions and get a 150. I have no issue doing that.""

Meanwhile, he has opened up about the ""complications"" he faced with Indian head coach Rahul Dravid.

India's star batter Virat Kohli has admitted that not being able to make any substantial contribution to team India's cause for a long time was ""eating him up"", and he let the expectations overwhelm him a bit because he was desperate to score a big Test hundred. Kohli hit a splendid 186 against Australia in the drawn fourth Test, ending a three-year wait for his 28th Test century.

Former India captain Virat Kohli ended a three-year drought in Test cricket, finally notching up his 28th Test century against Australia in the fourth Test at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad last week. Kohli scored a brilliant 186 in the fourth Test, which ended in a tame draw on Monday (March 13).

Virat had a long chat with head coach Rahul Dravid after the fourth Test in Ahmedabad, a video of which was shared by the BCCI on Tuesday (March 14).

""I had let complications grow on me a bit because of my shortcomings. The desperation to get that three figure mark can grow on you as a batter and I let that happen to me to some extent. I am not the guy who is happy with 40-45 runs, when I know I can get 150 and help my team. This was eating me up for a while. Not being able to get a big score for the team bothered me as I have always taken pride in performing in different conditions and situations whenever the team needed me. It was never about milestones. A hundred is something that just happens along the way in my goal of batting as much as long for my team and scoring as much as possible,"" said Virat in a video posted by BCCI, featuring Team India head coach Rahul Dravid.

""To be able to do that (score a hundred and perform well for team) gives you immense satisfaction. I will head into the WTC final relaxed,"" Kohli added.

Dravid also admitted that he was desperate to see Kohli score a Test century with him as a head coach so that he could get to enjoy it from the dressing room. Dravid also asked Virat to talk about how he approached his innings.

Kohli said that he knew he was playing well in the series and the wicket was good to bat on. ""As far as approaching this inning is concerned, I knew I was playing well, even in the Test matches before this one. It was a good wicket to bat on. The Australians utilised whatever little help was in the surface really well. I had to trust my defence and be patient. This is the template with which I have played always in Test. My defence is my strongest point. When I defend well, I know I can cash in whenever there is a lose ball to hit and get runs,"" said Kohli.

This was his first century in Tests since November 2019. In his marathon effort, he scored 186 runs in 364 balls, consisting of 15 fours. ""Boundaries were not easy to come by. Outfield was slow and the ball was soft. Something that calmed me down was that I was happy to run ones and twos and score my hundred. I can bat four, five sessions here. That is where fitness and physical preparations comes into play for me. I come out relaxed because I know I can bat in many ways. I am not desperate for fast runs. I am happy scoring 30 runs hitting in a session and not hit boundaries. I am fine with batting six sessions and getting a 150. I know boundaries will come eventually,"" Kohli added.

Kohli said that it is not possible to play the same way all the time because one needs to adjust as per conditions. ""This is one of the main reasons why I have been able to play all the formats of the game for so long. The adaptability comes from knowing physically I can do things in different ways. Mentally, I can prepare to play in a certain way. But I if my body would not support it, I would be found out,"" said Kohli.

""I have been able to different situations and conditions as I was able to run ones and twos and do power hitting as well.

Virat Kohli has acknowledged that not being able to contribute significantly to team India's cause was ""eating him up,"" and that he occasionally let expectations get the better of him in his attempt to hit a Test hundred.

After returning to form in ODIs and T20Is, the lengthy wait for his 28th Test hundred ended over in the fourth Test against Australia in Ahmedabad, where he hit a magnificent 186. The last time Kohli scored a hundred in a Test match was against Bangladesh in November 2019.

""Honestly, I've let the complications grow on me a bit because of my shortcomings,"" Kohli told coach Rahul Dravid in a chat on bcci.tv.

""The desperation to get to the three-figure mark is something that can grow on you as a batsman. I let that happen to me to a certain extent. But a flip side to it is, I'm not a guy who is happy with 40-45. I take a lot of pride in performing for the team.

""It's not like when Virat Kohli should stand out. When I'm batting on 40, I know I can get a 150. That was eating me up a lot.

""Why am I not able to get that big score for the team? Because I took pride in the fact that when the team needed me, I stood up, scoring in difficult conditions. The fact that I wasn't able to do that, was bothering me,"" he added.

The landmark century - his 75th international ton - came after a patient innings of 241 balls as he eased a Nathan Lyon delivery for a single. He then accelerated and made Australia's bowlers pay, before falling to off-spinner Todd Murphy in the final session as India's innings finished on 571 in response to Australia's 480. Of his 28 Test cricket hundreds, it was Kohli's second-slowest innings.

Crediting his fitness and training for being able to bat for extended periods of time, Kohli said, ""I can bat four sessions, I can bat five sessions, that's where the fitness and physical preparation comes into play for me.

""I go into the field relaxed because I know I can bat in many ways. I am not desperate if I play three sessions and feel like I am breaking down and I need to get fast runs otherwise I won't be able to stay out there for long,"" he said.

He further added: ""I am pretty happy scoring 30 runs in a session and not hitting a boundary and absolutely not desperate because I know that boundaries will come and even if I have to play like this I can bat six sessions and get a 150.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20 International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rahul Dravid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Off spin'}}]",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/187946-csytfshebq-1678782639.jpg,eng-8469535,0.1529411764705881,416481120,1,scroll.in,news,Scroll.in,Virat Kohli One Day International Twenty20 International Test cricket Australia Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Batting (cricket) India national cricket team Ahmedabad Rahul Dravid Innings Nathan Lyon Off spin,India,IN,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,12,9,2023-03-14

Virat Kohli is known for being a livewire on the field. The former India captain has cultivated a huge fan base thanks to his consistent performances with the bat and his aggressive brand of cricket. But Kohli is also someone who wears his heart on his sleeve and he often engages in friendly banter with his teammates and some times with the opposition as well.

A light-hearted video of Kohli is going viral on Twitter. The short clip is from the recently concluded fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

In the video, the 34-year-old can be heard saying, ""10 minute dur hai. Plane mein pehle he baith jaunga. Main udaunga aaj. (I will board the plane first and will fly it).""

Although the reference to his comment is not clear from the video, it can be assumed that Kohli and co were trying to have fun on the field on the fifth day with the Test heading towards a drab draw.

Kohli finally found his mojo back in red-ball cricket in the last Test of the four-match series. The star India batter notched up his first Test ton since November 2019. He scored a brilliant 186 against the mighty Australian team.

Furthermore, the knock came at a crucial time when Team India were under pressure. After Australia piled up 480 runs on the board, India needed a strong show with the bat as well.

Kohli and Shubman Gill scored centuries to put India in the safe zone.

Kohli's knock also showed his remarkable mental fortitude as he took 241 balls to complete his century. This was the second slowest of his 28 Test hundreds.

The lifeless pitch at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad had the final say as the fourth Test ended in a draw. Trailing India by 88 at the start of the fifth day, Steve Smith and Co needed to bat a little over two sessions to ensure the draw.

With the fourth and final Test match between India and Australia coming to an end with a draw on Day 5, the Indian side sealed the series 2-1 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. It came after both the captains decided to shake hands early when Australia were at 175/2 in their second innings.

During the Test, Virat Kohli ended his long wait for a century in red-ball cricket by smashing a patient 186. After the match, Kohli came up with a heartwarming gesture towards the Aussies.

In a video shared by the BCCI, the former captain was seen gifting his jerseys to Australia batters Usman Khawaja and wicketkeeper Alex Carey as memorabilia.

This came right after the Australian players had gifted a signed kit to Cheteshwar Pujara on his 100th Test earlier in the same series.

Virat Kohli wins Player of the Match trophy

Thanks to his smashing 186-run knock, Virat Kohli was awarded the 'Player of the Match' in Ahmedabad. The century was his his 75th in international cricket and 28th in Tests. Kohli finished the series as the second-highest run-scorer with 297 runs.

You're batting brilliantly, just need to...': India star 'puts his arm' around Kohli","Virat Kohli has finally ended his drought of centuries in all formats of international cricket by scoring 186 in the fourth Test between India and Australia that ended in a draw on Monday. Kohli's previous Test century, which came in November 2019, was also his last international century for nearly three years before he ended that barren run with a maiden T20I century at the 2022 Asia Cup. He then went on a run of scoring three ODI centuries in four matches but his scores had still failed to pick up in Test cricket.

Kohli's maiden T20I ton that ended the century-less run came against Afghanistan in September last year. He played two Tests in Bangladesh after that, scoring 1, 19 not out, 24 and 1 in the four innings. Kohli then had managed a highest score on 44 on what were mostly extremely difficult pitches to bat on during the first three Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy before finally getting a three-figure score in the fourth. Teammate and all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin said that he had a chat with Kohli after the third Test in Indore, which India had lost.

""Personally, Virat and I had a conversation after the Indore Test. Not that we both connect too often on such lines but I just personally felt that Virat was batting well,"" said Ashwin on Star Sports after Day 5 of the fourth Test on Monday. Kohli had been dismissed for 22 and 13 in Indore.

""He was getting time and was probably just getting out after getting starts, in the 30s and 40s. It was just about putting your hands around the shoulder and telling the person that you are batting brilliantly, just need to hang in there and things are going to turn around. It has turned for me in my cricketing career as well so, I felt a big knock (from Kohli) was around the corner.""

While Kohli managed a highest score of just 36 in India's series against New Zealand, which was their last assignment before the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Kohli had scored two centuries in three ODIs against Sri Lanka before that and scored 113 in the last ODI in Bangladesh. Ashwin said that getting Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara to bat well together would be a big bonus for India.

Watch | Cricket News","Talismanic India batter Virat Kohli finally got the Test hundred monkey off his back, scoring a triple-digit score for India in the first innings of the Ahmedabad Test. Though the gamed ended in a draw, Kohli's impressive 186-run knock gave the Indian team and its fans a sense of fulfilment. After the conclusion of the match, Kohli came up with a brilliant gesture for Australian batter Usman Khawaja, who also scored a century in the match, as well as wicket-keeper batter Alex Carey.

In a video shared by the Indian Cricket Team on Instagram, Kohli was seen gifting a shirt of his each to Khawaja and Carey. The gesture truly won the hearts of fans. Here's the video:

Kohli endured a painful wait of more than three years to notch his Test century number 28, the knock helping India finish with 571 in reply to Australia's 480 in the drawn fourth and final game.

""The expectations that I have for myself as a player are more important to me,"" Kohli told the official broadcasters after being adjudged Player of the Match.

""I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field,"" Kohli, who now has 75 international centuries, said.

""I think in Test cricket I wasn't able to play with my tempo and template that I have played with for the last 10 years for awhile now. So that was the one thing I was trying to do.

Brad Hogg, former Aussie spinner, has advised against comparing Virat Kohli to Sachin Tendulkar as the game of cricket has evolved significantly over the years. Although Test cricket is still highly regarded, it is undeniable that the quantity of red-ball matches being played has decreased due to the rise of T20 cricket and franchise-based leagues. Sachin Tendulkar's record of playing 200 Tests for India is unlikely to be surpassed by any cricketer who has debuted since the emergence of T20 cricket.

In contrast, Kohli, despite playing consistently for India in Test matches for over a decade now, has only been able to take part in half the number of games that Tendulkar played. Hogg believes that comparing Kohli and Tendulkar is pointless, and instead, he backed Kohli to perform well in the upcoming World Test Championship Final.

""Hopefully, we see the best of Kohli again. I think that there was too much pressure on Kohli in the last 2-3 years. The COVID, captaincy, and more cricket being played. Don't compare him with Sachin Tendulkar, because he was able to play more Test matches, and did not have to play IPL for most part of his career. I also think he is going to make a big one in the WTC Final as well,"" Hogg said on his YouTube channel.

Kohli smashed his 28th Test century on Sunday while batting against Australia in the 4th Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The 34-year-old smashed 186 off 364 deliveries and helped India post a mammoth total on the board. This was Kohli's first century in red-ball cricket in more than three years.

With this century, Kohli broke multiple records in the longest format of the game. Kohli has now become India's highest run-scorer in World Test Championship history. The 34-year-old now has 1803 runs from 31 matches which he has scored at an average of 36.79. Kohli also registered his highest individual score against Australia in Test cricket. The former India skipper is now the highest run-scorer for India in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He has amassed 297 runs from four matches at an average of 49.50. Earlier, Kohli equaled Sunil Gavaskar's record for the joint second-most tons by an Indian player against Australia, trailing only Sachin Tendulkar.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hogg', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Brad Hogg'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'First-class cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/smpyxe5w3psfeess_1678789516.jpeg,eng-8469535,0.2784313725490195,416486640,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Brad Hogg Virat Kohli Sachin Tendulkar Test cricket Cricket Twenty20 India Border–Gavaskar Trophy Spin bowling First-class cricket Batting (cricket) Australia Captain (cricket) Sunil Gavaskar,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,44,10,2023-03-14

Team India won the four match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia by a margin of 2-1 after the fourth Test in Ahmedabad ended in a draw. The match also ended the drought of centuries for former India captain Virat Kohli as he slammed a Test century nearly after 3.5 years.

Virat Kohli last scored his hundred against Bangladesh in November 2019 at the Eden Gardens and hit his fifth century in International cricket in the last six months. Virat also achieved many records while batting on Day 3 of the fourth Test match. Kohli became the third fastest Indian to complete 4000 Test runs on Indian soil and also broke Brian Lara's record and became the second batsman in the world to hit most international runs vs Australia.

Other than this, Virat Kohli also achieved many records in Test cricket which greats like Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar and Rohut Sharma also have not achieved. Fore his 186 runs knock in Ahmedabad, Kohli was awarded with the Player of the Match award. This was Virat Kohli's 10th Man of the Match award in the longest format of the game. With this honour, Virat Kohli has now become the only cricketer to have more than 10 MOM awards across formats.

At the age of 34 Virat Kohli has made 28 Test centuries and also has seven double centuries to his name. Virat also made many records being the captain of the Indian Test team. As a captain, Kohli holds the record of winning the ICC Test mace for most 5 times.

Virat also has the record of winning the first Test series in Australia as the Test captain whereas under his rule Team India was number in Tests for six continuous years. Virat Kohli also qualified for two consecutive ICC World Test Championship finals, one as an Indian captain and the other as a player.

Virat Kohli doesn't need any introduction for what he has done for Indian cricket and has won the team many matches on his own. Virat was going through a rough patch in international cricket but he ended his struggle and hit his most awaited 71st century in international cricket against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup 2022.

Virat was also part of the Indian cricket team who won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia and will be looking forward to continuing his performance in the upcoming World Test Championship final.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ricky Ponting'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Rohit Sharma'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Eden Gardens'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lara', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Brian Lara'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Century (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International Cricket Council'}}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/ot1znhhkziumsyza_1678791338.jpeg,eng-8469535,0.2941176470588236,416488380,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Virat Kohli Test cricket Cricket India Ricky Ponting Rohit Sharma Sachin Tendulkar Batting (cricket) Captain (cricket) Ahmedabad Australia Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Eden Gardens India national cricket team Brian Lara Afghanistan national cricket team Asia Cup International cricket ICC World Test Championship Century (cricket) International Cricket Council,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,13,11,2023-03-14

Veteran Australia batter Mark Waugh feels that Virat Kohli's Test century drought is over but he is not yet at his best when it comes to the longest format of the game. Kohli put an end to his much-awaited 28th Test century with a brilliant knock in the fourth Test of the 2023 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The former India captain scored 186 runs - which is the highest Test score against Australia.

Kohli's 27th Test ton came way back in 2019 against Bangladesh in the day-night Test match at Eden Gardens. Meanwhile, he scored 6 half-centuries between his 27th and 28th Test tons.

The batting maestro showed great composure during his 364-ball marathon knock which was laced with 15 fours.

Waugh, who was part of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy commentary team, watched Kohli closely during the four-match Test series.

The veteran batter said that Kohli meant business in Ahmedabad and played with responsibility as he played very less risky shots to help India post 571 in the second innings.

""The drought's over. The gates have opened,"" former Australian batter Mark Waugh said on Fox Cricket.

""You could tell right from the get-go he meant business. He played very few risky shots. He was so patient, just picked the bowling off,"" he added.

Waugh said that such is the class of Kohli that despite a 186-run knock he isn't at his 'pure best'.

""I don't think he's at his pure best at the moment, as far as his Test career is concerned ... but it just shows you his class.""

Talking about his big century drought, Waugh said it was a bit shocking that a player like Kohli failed to hit a century for such a long time.

The Norwegian dance crew 'The Quick Style,' which impressed the entire world with its performance on the Bollywood song Kala Chashma, is currently touring India. The group members shared the news of their visit with fans on social media a couple of days ago. Meanwhile, former India cricket team captain Virat Kohli met the dance group on Tuesday and shared a picture on his official Twitter handle.

Kohli turned to Twitter to upload a picture with The Quick Style dance group. He shared the photo with a caption, ""Guess who I met in Mumbai."" The photo appears to have been taken at a studio in the Bollywood city, where Kohli flew immediately after the end of the 4th Test match against Australia on Monday. Kohli has some commercial commitments to fulfill before the start of the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

The Quick Style dance group became a viral sensation after their performance on various Bollywood songs including Kala Chashma. They recently uploaded a video of themselves shaking the legs on Jehda Nasha. Upon their visit to India, the group also visited the office of Meta in Mumbai, where they interacted with creators from all over the country.

Virat Kohli, on the other hand, recently finished a four-match Test series against Australia, where he scored the most number of runs for India. Kohli ended his long-awaited century drought in Test cricket with a brilliant 186 off 364 balls in the final match in Ahmedabad. This was Kohli's first Test century in more than three years. His last Test hundred came in a pink-ball Test against Bangladesh in November 2019.

With the century on Sunday, Kohli broke multiple records in the format. He became India's highest run-scorer in World Test Championship history. He also equalled former India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar's record for joint second-most centuries against Australia in Tests. He is only behind the legendary Sachin Tendulkar on the list. Kohli will next be seen in a three-match ODI series against the Aussies.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Style', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Quick Style'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Dance'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Bollywood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Social media'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Mumbai'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Mumbai'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Premier League'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sunil Gavaskar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'ICC World Test Championship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/ardqnvc9jn7ekdea_1678796756.jpeg,eng-8469535,0.2392156862745098,416494200,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Quick Style Virat Kohli Dance Bollywood Test cricket India Twitter Australia India national cricket team Captain (cricket) Social media Mumbai Premier League Sunil Gavaskar Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 ICC World Test Championship Sachin Tendulkar One Day International Cricket Ahmedabad,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,50,12,2023-03-14

From rallying behind his teammates on the field to dominating the Australian bowlers with his elegant batsmanship, batting maestro Kohli capped off an unforgettable outing for Team India in the recently concluded 4th Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Ahmedabad.

On the final day of the 4th Test match between India and Australia, an animated Kohli was seen teasing umpire Nitin Menon following Team India's close Leg before wicket (LBW) call against Australian batter Travis Head. For the unversed, Kohli also left his teammates in splits with his funny chatter when star batter Marnus Labuschagne arrived at the crease on the final day of the 4th Test.

""10-minute door hai. Plane mein pehle he baith jaunga. Main udaunga aaj. (I'm gonna board the aeroplane first. I will fly it),"" Kohli's hilarious conversation with his India teammates was caught on the stump mic. The video of Kohli's epic remark became an instant hit among the fans and followers of the game.

Labuschagne, who was cleaned up by pace ace Mohammed Shami in the 1st innings, scored a brilliant 63 off 213 balls in the final match of the bilateral series. The top-ranked Australian batter remained unbeaten with stand-in skipper Steven Smith (10*) as Australia ended the 4th Test match in a draw. Head and Labuschagne's sublime knocks lifted Australia to 175-2d in 78.1 overs. Kohli's match-changing knock played a crucial role in helping India secure a 2-1 series win over Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on Monday.

The 34-year-old slammed his first Test century since November 2019 during the fourth and final encounter of the four-match series at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Saturday. Before his batting masterclass in Ahmedabad, Kohli had last scored a century in November 2019 against Bangladesh at Kolkata.

Kohli went without scoring a Test century in 41 back-to-back innings for the Asian giants. However, Kohli's longest century drought had arrived in 2012 (13 innings) prior to his maiden Test ton. During his recent century drought, run-machine Kohli had scored 1028 runs with an average of 25.70 in 41 innings. Kohli's magnificent 186-run knock guided India to a massive 1st innings total of 571 at Ahmedabad.

Kohli's knock guided Team India to a whopping total of 571 runs in the first innings and gave the team a lead of 91 runs. The match eventually ended in a draw after early stumps were called on Day 5 as Australia remained unbeaten at 175/2. With the draw, the Rohit Sharma-led side claimed the four-match series 2-1. It was a memorable moment for all the fans when Kohli, who had last hit a ton in the longest format in November 2019 against Bangladesh, crossed the triple figures after a hiatus of 3.5 years. The former India skipper also faced a lot of flak for his century drought from the fans and many cricket experts but the right-handed batter showed his real mettle with his fiery ton against Australia.

Talking about the criticism Kohli faced, former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir slammed all the critics and praised Kohli for always bouncing back from the tough times.

""Who are these people who are criticising Kohli? I really don't understand. At the end of the day he is human. It's not like he has a remote and you press the button everyday and you get a hundred and Kohli will win the match for India. Every player goes through ups and downs. I know because there are certain days when I feel I am bowling well but I don't pick any wickets,"" Amir told Hindustan Times.

""And then many a times it is like I bowl bizarrely, probably a full toss or down-the-leg delivery, and I get a wicket. You need luck as well. And you can never doubt Kohli for his hard work. He loves challenges. Every time he has been criticised, he has bounced back to prove them wrong,"" he added.

Coming to the match, Australia were 175 for 2 in 78.1 overs in their second innings when the players from the two teams decided to shake hands. Marnus Labuschagne (63) and Steve Smith (10) were at the crease when both Australian and Indian skippers agreed on not playing the full quota of the overs for the day.

India sealed their place in the final of the World Test Championships after Sri Lanka lost to New Zealand by two wickets in the Christchurch Test. Sri Lanka needed to win both their matches against the Kiwis to have any chance of making the WTC final and India will face Australia in summit clash.

Watch | Cricket News,"Star India batter Virat Kohli was on top of his powers in the fourth Test against Australia, which ended in a stalemate on Monday. Kohli looked in his element during the entire high-scoring encounter and scored his 28th Test century. It was Kohli's first century in the format after a gap of more than three years. Kohli's marathon 186-run knock guided India to a massive 1st innings total of 571, and was named 'Man of the Match' for his efforts.

During Australia's innings on Day 5, Kohli was enjoying his time in the outfield. Now, Kohli's hilarious chat with his teammates has gone viral on social media.

As Labuschagne was about to enter the pitch, Kohli was heard as saying to his teammates: ""10-minute door hai. Plane mein pehle he baith jaunga. Main udaunga aaj. (We are only 10 minutes away. I'm gonna board the aeroplane first. I will fly it.)""

Called ""King Kohli"" for his prolific run-making, the maestro racked up his 28th Test ton with a single off spinner Nathan Lyon in the second session to bring the house down in Ahmedabad.

Kohli went through an extended batting slump in 2021 and 2022, during which time he lost the Indian captaincy, one of the most high-pressure jobs in world sport.

The two teams now head into three one-day internationals starting Friday in Mumbai, ahead of the 50-over World Cup in India later this year.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_India', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Star India'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Player of the match'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Off spin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket World Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Limited overs cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Mumbai'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Mumbai'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}]","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-03/me2kdfe8_virat-kohli-806_625x300_14_March_23.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(800,400)",eng-8469535,0.1137254901960785,416499900,1,sports.ndtv.com,news,NDTVSports.com,Virat Kohli Test cricket Innings Star India Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019 Batting (cricket) Cricket pitch Player of the match India Australia Nathan Lyon Off spin Cricket World Cup Captain (cricket) Limited overs cricket One Day International Ahmedabad Mumbai,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,25,14,2023-03-14

Scoring his 28th Test century in the fourth Test match of the India-Australia series at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium, Virat Kohli provided relief not only to himself but also to millions of cricket fans worldwide. This was his first century in the longest format of the game since November 2019 when he achieved the triple-figure mark in a pink-ball Test match against Bangladesh at Kolkata's Eden Gardens.

""You made me wait for a long time since I became the coach. But what a beauty and it was an absolute privilege to watch the way you constructed your innings,"" Dravid told Kohli at the start of an interaction on BCCI. TV.

""Thanks for your kind words Rahul bhai. As far as approaching this inning is concerned. I knew that I was playing well even in the test matches before we played this one. To be fair, it was a really good wicket to bat on,"" Kohli replied.

Rahul Dravid was among those overjoyed by Kohli's accomplishment, having witnessed the Indian batting superstar achieve the milestone for the first time since he took over as head coach of the Indian team in November 2021. Dravid made a playful remark to Kohli, highlighting the long wait.

""But having said that I think the Australian whatever the little help was there in the wicket I think they utilised it really well. Their consistency to bowl in the little rough was created through Mitchell Starc's bowling for Nathan Lyon and the other off-spinner (Todd Murphy) as well. They capitalised on it really well. The fact that they put 7-2 field most of the time for me. It meant that I have to be patient and trust my defence and that's the template I have already played with in Test cricket,"" said the former Indian captain.

""The boundaries were not easy to come by, to be honest. The outfield was slow, the ball was soft and they were pretty consistent. One that really calmed me down as I am happy to just run ones and twos and score a hundred.

During their conversation, Kohli spoke in detail about his innings and praised the Australian bowling attack for making things difficult for India on a pitch with minimal support for bowlers. He also explained how Steve Smith's field setup complicated the run-scoring process.

""I am pretty happy scoring 30 runs in a session and not hitting a boundary and absolutely not be desperate because I know that boundaries will come and even if I have to play like this I can bat six sessions and get a 150. I have no issue doing that. Just the preparation paid off and it's a constant process and it is not something that you do for two months and three months I have been doing this for seven-eight years non-stop every day of my life,"" Kohli explained his approach behind the stunning knock of 186.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Rahul Dravid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Narendra Modi Stadium'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Eden Gardens'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kolkata'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nathan Lyon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Mitchell Starc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Off spin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Board of Control for Cricket in India'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}]",https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2023/03/14/1167429-untitled-design-22.jpg,eng-8469535,0.388235294117647,416508420,1,zeenews.india.com,news,Zee News,Rahul Dravid Virat Kohli Test cricket Innings Narendra Modi Stadium Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Eden Gardens Wicket Twenty20 Cricket Ahmedabad Kolkata India Nathan Lyon Mitchell Starc Australia national cricket team Off spin Bowling (cricket) Batting (cricket) India national cricket team Board of Control for Cricket in India Cricket pitch Captain (cricket),India,IN,,,Center-left,ChatGPT,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,14,47,16,2023-03-14

Kohli had a tough 2021 and 2022, failing to reach three figures in over 1,200 days. However, since scoring his first T20I century during the Asia Cup last year, Kohli hasn't looked back. The 34-year-old finished the T20 World Cup in Australia last year as the leading run-scorer and then hit three ODI centuries including two -- 113 and 166 not out -- against Sri Lanka in January, earlier this year.

Kohli's 28th Test ton comes as a huge boost for him and Team India, heading into June's World Test Championship final against Australia.

After the conclusion of the fourth and final Test, Kohli was involved in a candid chat with former India captain and current head coach Rahul Dravid.

In the video, Dravid teased Kohli by saying that he had to wait sixteen months to watch his Test century from the dressing room.

""You made me wait for a long time (since I became the coach). But what a beauty and it was an absolute privilege to watch the way you constructed your innings,"" said Dravid in a video shared on BCCI.tv.

Kohli acknowledged Dravid for his kind gesture and said that he enjoyed his time out in the middle.

""Thanks for your kind words Rahul bhai. As far as approaching this inning is concerned. I knew that I was playing well even in the test matches before we played this one. To be fair, it was a really good wicket to bat on,"" said Kohli.

Kohli also suggested while batting on the Ahmedabad pitch wasn't difficult, the Australian team made life difficult for him with their attacking 7-2 (seven players inside the inner circle and just two outside) field placement.

""But having said that I think the Australian whatever the little help was there in the wicket I think they utilised it really well. Their consistency to bowl in the little rough was created through Mitchell Starc's bowling for Nathan Lyon and the other off-spinner (Todd Murphy) as well. They capitalised on it really well.

This ton was a special one as it came after a long wait of 3.5 years and was Kohli's 75th international century. He had last touched the triple figures in Tests in November 2019 against Bangladesh. Kohli's fiery hundred guided Team India to a total of 571 on Day 4 of the fourth Test, which eventually ended in a draw on Monday. The right-handed batter has been receiving a lot of praise from fans as well as former cricketers.

Interestingly, former Australia batter Mark Waugh, who had criticised Kohli for dropping catches at the slip position during the first Test in Nagpur, also lavished praise on the former India skipper for his most-awaited century. However, Waugh doesn't think Kohli is at his best yet.

""The drought's over. The gates have opened. You could tell right from the get-go he meant business. He played very few risky shots. He was so patient, just picked the bowling off. I don't think he's at his pure best at the moment, as far as his Test career is concerned ... but it just shows you his class,"" Waugh said on Fox Cricket.

Waugh had earlier slammed Kohli after he had dropped Steve Smith and Peter Handscomb's catches at the slip during the first Test in Nagpur.

""Your legs have to be a lot closer to be able to move quickly. Kohli was very high-up in his position. Should have stayed down a bit. He should have done a little bit better. Almost as if he wasn't expecting it,"" Waugh had said during the commentary.

Coming to the match, Australia were 175 for 2 in 78.1 overs in their second innings when the players from the two teams decided to shake hands. Marnus Labuschagne (63) and Steve Smith (10) were at the crease when both Australian and Indian skippers agreed on not playing the full quota of the overs for the day.

India sealed their place in the final of the World Test Championships after Sri Lanka lost to New Zealand by two wickets in the Christchurch Test. Sri Lanka needed to win both their matches against the Kiwis to have any chance of making the WTC final and India will face Australia in summit clash.

Overnight batter Matthew Kuhnemann (6) and Travis Head (90) were the two wickets to fall after Australia resumed the final day at 3 for no loss. On Sunday, India posted a mammoth 571 in their first innings to take a crucial 91-run lead. Australia had posted 480 in their first essay.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Waugh', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Mark Waugh'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Caught'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Nagpur'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Handscomb', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Peter Handscomb'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fox Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Smith (cricketer)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Over (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bowling (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnus_Labuschagne', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Marnus Labuschagne'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Travis Head'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Kuhnemann', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Matthew Kuhnemann'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Christchurch'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Christchurch'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Sri Lanka'}}}]","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-03/qlt91bg_virat-kohli-bcci_625x300_13_March_23.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=675",eng-8469535,0.1686274509803922,416548560,1,sports.ndtv.com,news,NDTVSports.com,Mark Waugh Virat Kohli Test cricket Australia Batting (cricket) India Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 Caught India national cricket team Nagpur Peter Handscomb Fox Cricket Steve Smith (cricketer) Over (cricket) Bowling (cricket) Captain (cricket) Marnus Labuschagne Travis Head Matthew Kuhnemann Innings Wicket Christchurch New Zealand Sri Lanka,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,15,56,3,2023-03-15

Steve Smith conceded that India's 2-1 series triumph, their fourth consecutive victory by a similar margin since 2017, was a fair result, referencing an 'hour of madness' on the third morning in New Delhi that undermined his side's challenge.

That hour of madness was when Australia slumped from their overnight 61 for one, and an overall lead of 62, to 113 all out with a series of barely believable sweep shots on a track of low bounce. Accepting the gift with grateful hands, India surged to a comfortable six-wicket win to open up an unbeaten 2-0 advantage.

Typical of how their sporting psyche is wired, Australia bounced back in spectacular style in Indore without skipper Pat Cummins and influential opener David Warner, stand-in captain Smith masterminding a stunning coup on a sandpit to raise hopes of a 2-2 series stalemate following easy Indian wins in Nagpur and New Delhi. A flatbed that reduced the final Test to a batathon thwarted those designs, but Australia could walk away with their heads held high.

India were found wanting in Indore, their batting techniques laid threadbare by a spin trio of one master (Nathan Lyon) and two rookies (Todd Murphy and Matt Kuhnemann). While it's hard to ignore those two staggering batting meltdowns, India unearthed heroes when they needed them most.

Skipper Rohit Sharma led from the front with a vitally significant hundred in the opening act, Ravindra Jadeja prospered with bat and ball on his comeback to Test cricket, R Ashwin reiterated how vital he is to this Indian wheel, Shubman Gill underlined his class and Axar Patel showcased how far he has come along as a Test batsman, though his bowling efficacy was remarkably stunted.

The most heartening development from an Indian perspective, as significant as making it to the final of the World Test Championship, retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and winning the series, was the return to big run-making ways of Virat Kohli. Having averaged in the 25s in 23 Tests since the beginning of 2020, the former captain was the archetypal immovable object in Ahmedabad, playing with the unshakable determination if not flair and authority of old. His 28th Test hundred, 1025 days after No. 27, blossomed from relentless accumulation to a free-spirited exhibition of stroke-making once he had brought up three-figures. His last 86 runs in a 511-minute show of restraint and gumption was an exhilarating throwback to the times when Kohli decimated attacks with unerring regularity.

The Star India batter touched the triple figures in the longest format after a hiatus of three years. Kohli, who earlier recovered from his lean patch in the T20I format with a fiery century against Afghanistan in the 2022 Asia Cup, brought up his 75th international ton on Sunday. The 34-year-old batter, who smashed 186 runs in the fourth Test, initially struggled to get a big score in the first three matches of the four-match series.

Veteran all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin revealed that he had a conversation with Kohli after India's loss in the third Test in Indore, where the former India skipper was dismissed for 22 and 13.

""Personally, Virat and I had a conversation after the Indore Test. Not that we both connect too often on such lines but I just personally felt that Virat was batting well,"" said Ashwin on Star Sports after Day 5 of the fourth Test.

""He was getting time and was probably just getting out after getting starts, in the 30s and 40s. It was just about putting your hands around the shoulder and telling the person that you are batting brilliantly, just need to hang in there and things are going to turn around. It has turned for me in my cricketing career as well so, I felt a big knock (from Kohli) was around the corner,"" he added.

Ashwin went on to praise Kohli for his heroics in the T20Is against Sri Lanka, where he smashed two centuries in three matches. He also said the Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara are plus points for India in the upcoming matches.

""Even in the ODI series before this, Virat played some wonderful knocks. He is batting well. It is a question of having him and Pujji batting well together which gives us a lot of advantage. One can eat up the balls while the other has a real presence,"" said Ashwin.

""After playing for so many years I know that runs on board are really important and these two players are our top Test batsmen. Our runs are running come from there so I would do anything to sit and watch them bat all day,"" he added.

Talking about the fourth Test, Australia were 175 for 2 in 78.1 overs in their second innings when the players from the two teams decided to shake hands. Marnus Labuschagne (63) and Steve Smith (10) were at the crease when both Australian and Indian skippers agreed on not playing the full quota of the overs for the day.

A host of Indian cricketers including Virat Kohli, Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel have made massive improvements in the ICC Test rankings after India's 2-1 series win over Australia in the recently-concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Leading the way is Virat Kohli, who after a gap of over three years, scored his first Test century and was thud propelled seven places to be ranked No. 13 on the list. Once the World's No. 1 ranked batter in all formats, Kohli had fallen out of the Top-10 in July last year after a string of poor performances, and while he still hasn't broken in top 10, his knock of 186 is hopefully a sign of wonderful things to come. A jump of seven places is a result of him being India's highest and overall, the second-highest run-getter of BGT 2023. Only Rishabh Pant (ranked 5th) and Rohit Sharma (10th) are the two Indians ahead of him.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Axar Patel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_Test_Team_Rankings"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': ""ICC Men's Test Team Rankings""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International Cricket Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rohit Sharma'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rishabh Pant'}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/15/1600x900/kohli-ashwin-feed_1678869262543_1678869267518_1678869267518.jpg,eng-8469535,0.06666666666666665,416565840,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Ravichandran Ashwin Axar Patel Virat Kohli ICC Men's Test Team Rankings International Cricket Council Australia national cricket team Test cricket Rohit Sharma Batting (cricket) India national cricket team Rishabh Pant,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,15,44,8,2023-03-15

Highlight movements came from Player of the Series R Ashwin, who maintained his top spot among the bowlers, and Player of the Match in the fourth Test Virat Kohli who jumped seven places.

Spinner Ashwin was named Player of the Series for his 25 wickets at an average of 17.28 which helped him regain sole ownership of the No 1 spot for Test bowlers ahead of England seamer James Anderson.

Teammate Virat Kohli was the big mover in the batting charts following his drought-breaking century in Ahmedabad, with the former India skipper jumping seven places to 13th overall. Kohli struck 186 runs in the first innings of the drawn Test.

The ton broke a 1205-day century drought for Kohli. He is now on the heels of teammates Rishabh Pant (ninth) and Rohit Sharma (10th) as India players ahead of him on the Test batter rankings.

Axar Patel's good show with the bat throughout the series was also rewarded. The left-hander moved up eight places to 44th on the list for batters and climbed one place to fourth overall on the list for all-rounders following an impressive 264 runs over the four matches. Axar finished India's second-highest run scorer in the series - behind Kohli.

On the other side, Australian opener Usman Khawaja improved two spots to seventh on the Test batter rankings following a series-high 333 runs. Cameron Green jumped 11 places to 26th on the list for batters after he scored his maiden Test century in the fourth Test. Travis Head maintained his fifth place on the batters list at a new career high of 853 rating points.

There was further movement induced by New Zealand's thrilling win over Sri Lanka in the first Test and South Africa inflicting a clean sweep on West Indies.

New Zealand captain Tim Southee climbed six places to 12th on the list for Test bowlers following a seven-wicket haul in Christchurch. Teammate Daryl Mitchell improved four places to eighth on the Test batter rankings after scores of 102 and 81 against the island nation.

New South Africa captain Temba Bavuma rose 14 places to 15th overall on the list for Test batters and teammate Aiden Markram improved 11 spots to 22nd.

Kyle Mayers was the only positive for the West Indies, with the right-armer jumping 10 places to 32nd on the list for Test bowlers and three spots to seventh overall on the list for all-rounders.

There were few changes in the T20 Rankings as well after Bangladesh handed world champions England an embarrassing 3-0 defeat.

Najmul Hossain Shanto shot up 68 spots to 16th overall on the list for T20I batters, while Litton Das improved nine places to 22nd after his match-winning half-century in the third and final outing.

Left-arm seamer Mustafizur Rahman moved up 16 places to 20th overall in the T20I rankings for bowlers, while skipper Shakib Al Hasan improved nine spots to joint 24th on the same list.",[],"[{'uri':

He scored 186 off 364 balls.

Veteran India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has revealed that he had a conversation with Virat Kohli about the latter's batting form after the end of the third Test match against Australia. Speaking on Star Sports, Ashwin said he spoke to Kohli after the Indore Test and told him that he was batting well and he just needs to hang in there to see things turn around for him. Ashwin stated that he felt a big knock from Kohli was around the corner because of the way he has been batting in the recent past.

""Personally, Virat and I had a conversation after the Indore Test. Not that we both connect too often on such lines but I just personally felt that Virat was batting well. He was getting time and was probably just getting out after getting starts, in the 30s and 40s. It was just about putting your hands around the shoulder and telling the person that you are batting brilliantly, just need to hang in there and things are going to turn around. It has turned for me in my cricketing career as well so, I felt a big knock (from Kohli) was around the corner,"" Ashwin said.

""Even in the ODI series before this, Virat played some wonderful knocks. He is batting well. It is a question of having him and Pujji batting well together which gives us a lot of advantage. One can eat up the balls while the other has a real presence. After playing for so many years I know that runs on board are really important and these two players are our top Test batsmen. Our runs are running come from there so I would do anything to sit and watch them bat all day,"" he added.

Kohli ended his long-awaited century drought in the fourth Test match of the recently-concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He scored 186 off 364 balls to bring up his 28th Test century. This was Kohli's first century in the longest format after a gap of more than three years. Kohli's last century in red-ball cricket came in a pink-ball Test against Bangladesh in November 2019. Kohli scored four centuries since then but all of them came in white-ball formats.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ravichandran Ashwin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Indore'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Spin bowling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019–20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'First-class cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Limited overs cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}]",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/iglq34tmxmh9qivy_1678875225.jpeg,eng-8469535,0.1529411764705881,416573100,1,republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Ravichandran Ashwin Virat Kohli Batting (cricket) Test cricket Indore Border–Gavaskar Trophy Spin bowling Australia national cricket team India Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20 First-class cricket Limited overs cricket One Day International Cricket,India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,15,45,10,2023-03-15

Kohli was coming through the ranks when Dravid was reaching the end of his career. In fact, during Dravid's final series for India, Kohli scored his maiden Test century - against Australia in the 2012 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. If that you feel wasn't written, in another huge coincidence, Kohli also scored a hundred in Dravid's final ODI for India. Dravid scored 69 and Kohli sizzled with 107 as the two put on a 170-run partnership for the fifth wicket.

Today, 12 years later, Kohli is a legend of the game, while Dravid is Team India's head coach. Dravid had to wait almost 16 months to finally see from the dressing room Kohli scoring his first Test century in over three years. Over the last few months, Dravid must have been asked about Kohli and his form a gazillion times and not once did The Wall's lost his faith in Kohli. And why would it? It was always only a matter of time before The King reclaimed his throne. Once he smacked that century against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup, things started falling back in place. The epic knock of 82 against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, emerging as the highest run-scorer of the tournament, striking two centuries in three ODIs not too long and now a Test century after 40 months has culminated the journey of Kohli's return to the top.

""In India when you become a player as big as Virat Kohli, people have such high expectations. When I played and used to bat with Sachin Tendulkar, I saw the same. Everyone wants him to score a century, score runs. And this happens because he has set a standard. He has scored centuries so regularly that people don't realise how tough it is to score a hundred. And then obviously, the pressure builds,"" Dravid told the broadcasters at the end of the India vs Australia 2023 Test series.

""A player of Kohli's calibre wants to contribute, stay involved. He looks at it in a way 'How can I contribute? What can I do to win the match for India?' And somewhere he must have felt that I am not able to give that world-class performance in Test matches which the team has become habitual of.""

What caught everyone's attention was how Kohli's innings of 186 was a stark contrast to some of his previous centuries. Kohli scored his runs off 364 balls and had hit just five boundaries by the time he reached his century and had even gone an entire session without scoring a single four. Sure, the pitch was good to bat on but application was still needed.

Kohli played as per the situation knowing that India needed to overhaul Australia's first-innings total of 480, which thanks to his 28th century was ensured. Moved by Kohli's tenacity, grit and determination, Dravid highlighted the ability to mould and play according to the situation irrespective of how big a player, is something youngsters can learn watching this modern-day great.

""If young kids are watching - we keep talking and sometimes as coach, we get frustrated too - I hear a lot that 'this is my style and I'm only going to play like this'. In this match a big player has shown that if the situation is tough and the team is slightly on the defensive, the opposition is not giving you boundaries, you can play differently and still score a century for the team,"" Dravid pointed out.

""He scored just five fours in his first 100 runs. He could have gotten frustrated - felt I will smash, dominate - but he knew what the team needed in that situation. This is a special trait of a big player. Doesn't matter how great a player you are, you need to have humility, the will to.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Rahul Dravid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'One Day International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border–Gavaskar_Trophy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Border–Gavaskar Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wicket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuvraj_Singh', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Yuvraj Singh'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020–21', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket World Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twenty20'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Boundary (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket pitch'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Innings'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Duck (cricket)'}}]",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/14/1600x900/kohli-dravid-bcci-class_1678812545860_1678812551177_1678812551177.jpg,eng-8469535,0.06666666666666665,416575020,1,hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,Rahul Dravid Virat Kohli Test cricket India One Day International Australia Border–Gavaskar Trophy Wicket India national cricket team Yuvraj Singh Asia Cup South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020–21 Cricket bat Sachin Tendulkar Cricket World Cup Twenty20 Pakistan Afghanistan Boundary (cricket) Cricket pitch Innings Duck (cricket),India,IN,,,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,15,17,11,2023-03-15

In 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named Kohli as the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has contributed to India's important successes, including the team's triumph in the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions Trophy. Recently he came roaring back to form and silenced his critics with a perfectly crafted 186 against Australia in the Test match at Ahmadabad.

Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017 and the coveted Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2018. In 2016, he was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN. Time magazine included him in its list of the 100 most influential people of the world. In 2020 his estimated earnings were about $26 million and he is followed on Instagram by top Bollywood stars. What qualities made him so successful in his career?

All this happened because of his obsessive determination to raise the standard of game from an early age. He has an inborn love for cricket which was encouraged by his father. He joined the West Delhi Cricket Academy where he was coached by Rajkumar Sharma. According to the coach the nine-year-old Kohli displayed unbelievable talent.

But talent alone is not enough. There has to be commitment and consistent hard work. In these qualities too, Kohli was not found lacking. Hyderabad's R. Sridhar who served as fielding coach of the Indian team for seven years has observed Kohli from close quarters for a long time. Sridhar has written a book in which he has described his experiences with the Indian team.

According to the coach, Kohli has a fanatical devotion to excellence that is rarely seen. In 2014, when M.S. Dhoni was injured, Virat Kohli was given the task of wearing the captain's mantle against Australia. On his very first day as captain he told the team to use the same methods that he himself had used. He told the players to take practice as seriously as they took a match. ""When you wake up in the morning, you must think of your practice at the nets. Who will be the bowlers who will bowl to you? How will you tackle him? Do they have any weaknesses you can exploit? These are the questions that should be going on in your minds even before you begin your practice,"" Kohli told his players.

As a captain, Kohli was second to none. He taught the team how to enjoy pressure and not to wilt under it. According to coach Sridhar, Kohli would always want the most severe and hard drills during practice. Kohli's motto was that only if you prepared thoroughly for the hard stuff then you were fully prepared. Virat brought fearlessness, passion and intensity into his leadership style. And he demanded the same attitude and approach from every member of his team.

Kohli's dedication to fitness is of a very high level. It was his stupendous resolve that helped him to rise during his initial years in the sport. From a young age he gave up ice creams and sweets. His carefully modulated diet plans, his workouts in the gym and his high-octane performances, made him an inspirational figure for all other cricketers. With single minded diligence he has always maintained his weight at 69 kilos and his waist at a trim 32 inches.

New Zealand's greatest batsman Martin Crowe summed up Kohli perfectly when he said several years ago: ""Kohli combines within himself the intensity of Dravid, the audacity of Sehwag and the range of Tendulkar. Along with all that he also has great intelligence and fighting spirit.""

Those words aptly describe the personality and character of India's most accomplished batter after Tendulkar. It is likely that he will maintain his physical and mental fitness for several more years. Kohli is the Cristiano Rolando of cricket and we may see more records flowing from his bat in the coming years.","[{'uri': 'abhijit_sen_gupta@siasat.com', 'name': 'Abhijit Sen Gupta', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Virat Kohli'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkumar_Sharma', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Rajkumar Sharma'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Australia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khel_Ratna_Award', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Khel Ratna Award'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Champions_Trophy', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hockey Champions Trophy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International Cricket Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_100', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Time 100'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna_Award', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Arjuna Award'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Shri', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Padma Shri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Sachin Tendulkar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket World Cup'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India national cricket team'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bollywood'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Test cricket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'ESPN'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Instagram'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ahmedabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'MS Dhoni'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Captain (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Hyderabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Hyderabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Crowe', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Martin Crowe'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cricket bat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Batting (cricket)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'New Zealand'}}}]",https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/virat-kohli.jpg,eng-8469535,0.4431372549019608,416591700,1,siasat.com,news,The Siasat Daily,Virat Kohli Cricket Rajkumar Sharma Australia Khel Ratna Award Hockey Champions Trophy International Cricket Council Time 100 Arjuna Award Padma Shri Sachin Tendulkar Cricket World Cup India national cricket team Bollywood Test cricket ESPN Instagram Ahmedabad India MS Dhoni Captain (cricket) Hyderabad Martin Crowe Cricket bat Batting (cricket) New Zealand,India,IN,Hindi-Urdu-English,hin-urd-eng,,,C18,C17,Asia,AS,Hindu,103.0,138.0,112.0,54.0,124.0,70.0,39.0,84.0,89.0,125.0,112.0,106.0,161.0,77.0,48.0,56.0,40.0,51.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,15,55,15,2023-03-15
