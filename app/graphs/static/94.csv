There is so much tension in the country on all fronts.""

""Of course, it is the Holy Month. Two days ago, it was Palm Sunday, a significant moment in the Christian community's observance of Lent, when Christians fast for 40 days and 40 nights, and take on Christ-like conduct and virtues and seek the eye of God. Muslims are also in the Ramadan season, the Holy Month. Both religions preach friendship, understanding, kindness towards the poor, sacrifice and the spirit of sharing and giving. A few days earlier, there was so much talk about traditional worshippers, especially in Lagos state, talking about rituals, placement of sacrificial offerings at crossroads, and yet you say there is so much tension in the country.""

""You have not answered my question. What I know is that every day, Nigerians mouth the mantra that we all worship the same God and that we are all children of God, whoever and whatever we worship. But what I see is a country that has no fear of God. What people do is different from what they say! Religion has failed in this country. We should ban religion.""

""Hey Hey, calm down. Nobody has banned religion in Russia, China, United States or Cuba. Na here you want to ban religion? Human beings are by nature superstitious, but the problem we have in this country is that there is a gap between public morality and private morality. People go to church or the mosque but don't be deceived, they don't care about values, they don't give a damn about virtues, they go to church, the mosques and shrines, they claim we are all serving one God, but you can't see a trace of it in their relationship with other human beings.""

""The language of persons with street credibility. Too much violence, verbal, physical and spiritual in the country of our birth, right now, today, everywhere. Too much ethnic and religious hate and bigotry. I think people are losing their minds because of the elections. And I think we need to remind ourselves that there is a country, and that the country is more important than individual ambitions and preferences.""

""Point of correction. There was a country.""

""There is a country. And there will still be a country. Can we all step out of the mass psychosis that we are dealing with?""

""The psychotics know themselves. The people who have turned election into a source of craze know themselves.""

""Yes. Like your friends in the All Progressives Congress (APC) who are now leaking Peter Obi's telephone conversations, and who claim that he is trying to start a religious war by campaigning on the basis of ethnicity and religion, and they and their allies have put into circulation a doctored version of a telephone conversation between him and Bishop David Oyedepo. Their intent is to ridicule him and lower him in the estimation of serious-minded and reasonable people of society"".

""I don't know who put out any audio conversation, doctored, not doctored. What I know is that there is so much hostility out there because of an election. In the first place, don't believe everything that you see on social media. We are in the age of Artificial Intelligence, ChatGPT and all kinds of manipulations. You must always fact-check.""

""The Labour Party and the Obidients have confirmed that their candidate actually spoke with Bishop David Oyedepo except that the leaked audio is manipulated, fake, doctored. They say there is a plan to arrest Peter Obi for treasonable felony""

""Nobody is above the law. But is that how people are arrested? The people that should be arrested are the people who leaked the phone call between two persons. It is a violation of Section 37 of the 1999 Constitution and all other relevant laws on data protection, consumer protection and freedom of information. People have the right to privacy. That is why there is something called lawyer-client, doctor-patient privilege and confidentiality. If people are allowed to go about leaking other people's private conversations, society will be ruined. Imagine someone for example, hacking into your conversation with your female friends, and sending same to your wife and other girlfriends, you would have instant chaos in your life. Your life expectancy will reduce.""

""That is a wrong analogy. I am a straight and decent man. I am not even a card-carrying politician. But someone told me that we have the right to know everything about people in the public domain, and that it is a good thing to leak everything about politicians.""

""I know what you are saying. Volenti non fit inuria. That is the principle. It does not apply here though. Even politicians have rights. In any case, in the so-called released audio conversation, I don't see anything that is wrong. People are just making a mountain out of a mole-hill. Politicians all over the world play to their base, they mobilise their base, they reach out to persons of influence. Peter Obi calling Bishop Oyedepo, a man of great influence and asking him for support for whatever reason is not an issue. It does not amount to calling for a religious war. It is perfectly within his right to seek celebrity endorsement. In any case, Bishop Oyedepo has shaken it all off. Did you listen to his riposte? He is a man of God. He advises everyone that seeks his counsel, whether they take it or not. Has anybody queried why in the last elections, Muslim clerics supported the Muslim-Muslim ticket? Have they looked for conversations between Muslim candidates and Muslim leaders? Look, the election is over, people who are aggrieved should go to court. The various spokespersons who have been exchanging vitriol over nothing should go and look for work. You can't be a spokesperson for another man permanently. Get busy. Election don finish oh! Boys! Move on!""

""I hear people are looking for appointments, especially within the APC, and that the President-elect is already putting together a team. He is building a team.""

""You mean team-ship?""

""Yes, team-ship. Serious lobbying going on. The other day, it was Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi lobbying openly that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers must be given a core role in the Tinubu government. I hear some people are also already organizing civil society groups to say that they must be in the government. In fact, some men have since abandoned their wives and children and turned themselves into Tinubu's handbags, struggling to make themselves useful. They are with him in France as we speak.""

""The things that hunger, greed and poverty will cause in this country will be serious. But truly, I don't have a problem with the attempt to put a team together. Nigeria can no longer afford a ridiculous situation where a President would be sworn in and for six months, he would claim he is still looking for a team. No. There are urgent matters ahead. The President must hit the ground running. As long as he recruits the best and the brightest, not mediocres, not IOU-seekers, opportunists, habitual drunkards, and second-rate clowns in the corridors of power, I don't have a problem with that.""

""Who is a second-rate clown? A clown is a clown""

""I know what I am saying. Some first-rate clowns in this country are educated billionaires. Don't force me to mention names. If you must recruit a court jester, at least get the good ones. We have had too many jesters running the Nigerian government.""

""But people say Tinubu should wait till the dispute around the Presidential election is resolved.""

""There is nothing in our laws that says so. Section 285 of the 1999 Constitution provides very strict timelines for election petitions. Lawyers exploit this. They will stretch the matter with every possible trick. By May 29, Tinubu would be sworn in. The process has started. He will promptly announce a Cabinet and activate Section 5 of the 1999 Constitution which grants him extensive executive powers to appoint and disappoint. Within a week, a full government would be up and running. You can keep talking to the courts!""

""I don't think that is right""

""It is not a matter of what you think. It is what the law makes possible.""

""We have to change the law. All election disputes must be finalized before inauguration. The Uwais Commission made such a recommendation. We must go back to it. That is what they do in Kenya and other places. Now I understand why some people are calling for an Interim National Government and why one man tried to stop a commercial plane from flying and threatened that there will be no Presidential inauguration on May 29.""

""I hope you also understand that the Department of State Services, and other security agencies have made it clear that anybody who tries to subvert the state, will be made to face the full wrath of the law. Nobody should test the patience of the state-qua-state. Be careful. I won't make a case for you.""

""I don't make trouble with anybody. I have enough issues of my own. I mind my business. I only discuss politics when we are together like this. I raise questions. I am not likely to go on television like Datti Baba-Ahmed to say any attempt to swear in Tinubu would signal the end of democracy, and then get a TV station fined. I will not board a plane like that Obiajulu man and say there will be no inauguration on May 29. I will not act like the Eze Ndigbo of Ajao estate and proclaim that Igbos in Lagos will invite IPOB to Lagos to defend Igbo properties and investments. But we have to understand the context and understand that people are angry.""

""But you know why we are having these issues, because the people do not trust the courts. Not even that musician called Portable, Habeeb Okikiola. When the police went to arrest him, after several invitations and he had snubbed them, he told them that he is a government liability, a celebrity, a Baboon, who belongs to the zoo. Zazuh zeh! That is how many Nigerians behave. They don't trust the system.""

""You don't read the news.? On Friday, he was arrested by the police, and told in clear terms that being a celebrity does not confer any constitutional immunity on him, and that he is truly a government liability and not an asset. He spent the weekend in a police cell in Abeokuta. Yesterday, he was arraigned in a Magistrate Court in Ifo, Ogun State where he was slammed with a three-count charge, and remanded in Ilaro prison until he discharges his bail terms.""

""Nigeria is a wicked place to aspire to be anything.""

""No. Obey the law. The same Portable that was boasting that he is a Baboon. He has been told now that Baboons in the zoo are kept in cages, and he has been kept behind bars accordingly. I hope they lock him up with very gluttonous mosquitoes. In fact, I suspect they did. He was looking very contrite in court. A se ko ti e le. Him no get liver. Egungun better be careful! This is why everybody should be calm. After the elections, everyone should learn to be calm.""

""Make we calm, make we calm down. But there is a way this country also gets on your nerves. People are reacting in their own ways. Look at Rivers state, lawyers who went to Port Harcourt for election matters were arrested and detained, and the materials in their possession were seized. That is enough to make anybody angry.""

""They have been released.""

""So. But a point has been made. Whoever wants to challenge the election results in Rivers State is not welcome and you know what happened on February 25 and March 18 in that state and after the elections, parties across the country have been suspending key officials of their parties from the Peoples' Democratic Party in Benue, the Labour Party in Edo State to the APC in Delta, Kwara, Bauchi and Zamfara States. Some people are just determined to heat up the polity.""

""I am sure if you check the stories from those states very well, you'd see that for the most part, it is mainly about disagreement over ego, stomach infrastructure, and nothing about Nigeria and its future.""

""Even when people try to fight for the future, they are not allowed. I am sure you know that is the way we are.""

""Earlier on, we discussed Tinubu getting ready for the future, you said that was right. In Kano, Governor-elect, Abba Kabir Yusuf of the New Nigeria People's Party (NNPP) has issued two advisories. On March 30, he issued an advisory on ongoing constructions in the state in public spaces and urged that they should be stopped until the incoming administration assumes office. On March 31, he issued another advisory to say that no financial institution should grant any loans to Kano State because the in-coming administration will not honour such loans. He has been told he is jumping the gun. Governor Ganduje has told him that he is still in charge until May 29. I don't understand this country. We are a nation of hypocrites and double standards.""

""To be fair, the Governor-elect of Kano State does not yet have the imprimatur of the law. He is not yet a constituted authority""

""This is the problem then. How can we have a proper country when Nigerians have over 200 million opinions on any subject under the sun and the country's population itself is over 200 million!""","{'uri': 'thisdaylive.com',

AS the World seeks to foster economic growth and development, revenue generation through tax collection has increased its imperative as an alternative and viable means to fund key infrastructural projects around the globe. This is even more so because of the damaging economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian vs. Ukraine war and other natural disasters. These and other factors have heightened the place taxes in sustaining developmental projects particularly in less developed countries such as Nigeria that require constant stream of income to fund social programmes, public investments including in the areas of health, education, capital infrastructure and other services that are important for the attainment of the common goal of a progressive nation.

The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, pressed home this point recently when he emphasised the need for Nigeria to sustain infrastructural projects through tax revenue just as he noted the importance of tax collection to funding the budget. He expressed the belief that the government can only pay the contractor handling any development project in the country when there is money available.

Two recessions in less than five years left Nigeria in a situation of near economic stagnation that engendered more borrowing from sources. The consequence of the increased borrowing is a debt portfolio of about N77.7 trillion. To mitigate the impact of this, Nigeria realizes that it must necessarily seek alternative sources of funds for infrastructural development purposes. This is where the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has kicked in. The Service has been able to contribute quite a chunk of resources to the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) despite the COVID-19 pandemic-induced global economic downturn.

Under the leadership of Muhammad Nami, the FIRS has, within the past few difficult years, considerably shortened the funding gap by providing the much-needed resources for government to sustain its programmes, pay salaries and embark on major infrastructural projects like the Kaduna-Kano rail project, the Second Niger bridge and the Mambilla power plant. In 2021, the Service achieved a record tax collection of N6.41 trillion, representing over 100 per cent of its collection target for the year. It was the first time it crossed the N6 trillion threshold.

In 2022, the FIRS took its game a notch higher, contributing N10.1 trillion in tax revenue to the Federation Account. This became the highest sum ever collected by any revenue-generating agency in Nigeria. The impact of this huge contribution to the nation's purse was more funds for the government to carry on with its implementation of critical projects, pay salaries and to meet other running costs. It will, therefore, be understating the fact to say that the FIRS efforts also helped the economy to speedily recover from the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.

Very significantly, tax revenue has become a catalyst for human capital development through infrastructure projects in Nigeria's tertiary education system. Over the years, the FIRS, through its collection of tertiary Education Tax, has contributed immensely to the development of human capital growth and infrastructure provision in the country's tertiary institutions. The Vice Chancellor of Bayero University Kano, Prof. Sagir Adamu Abbas, affirmed that between 2020 and 2022, the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) approved over N12 billion for the establishment of 12 research centres in the six geopolitical zones of the country in pursuit of the goal of improved human capital development in the country.

Previously, many public institutions of learning found themselves in decadent conditions, exemplified by poor infrastructure that were not close to fit enough for a meaningful learning environment. This was attributed to, majorly, inadequate funding. To ameliorate the situation, the Education Tax, a system of tax contributions from the profits made by companies in Nigeria, provided the desired revenue breather for the nation's public tertiary institutions of learning.

At 2.5 percent of a companies' profits, the education tax is imposed on all registered firms in Nigeria, while the FIRS is mandated to collect it on behalf of the TETFund, which in turn, dispenses the funds to the beneficiary public tertiary institutions. Sunday Echono, the Executive Secretary of TETFund, confirmed that the Fund has spent about N2.5 trillion in the last three years financing infrastructural development in public universities, polytechnics and colleges of education. He had kind words for companies in Nigeria over their compliance to their tax obligation, affirming that because of this, ""We are seeing improved funding to our tertiary education institutions as a result of the education tax.""

Heads of tertiary institutions across the six geopolitical zones have also attested to the unprecedented impacts of the Education Tax funds collected by the FIRS in the development of infrastructure, human capital development, and research in their respective institutions. For the Provost of Federal College of Education Abeokuta, Dr Rafiu Adekola Soyele, the college has no doubt benefited immensely from taxpayers' money. ""Since 2011, the college has benefited a lot in terms of infrastructure, facilities and capacity building for staff, even non-teaching staff, in terms of conferencing, science laboratory equipment and more. I can testify that the federal government has really tried going by the several interventions that we have gotten.""

With the effort put in to make funds available for interventions in different sectors of the economy, the FIRS is seeking judicious use of resources by government at all levels as a means of encouraging citizens to comply with their tax obligations.

While commenting on the performance of FIRS in 2022 fiscal year, Nami attributed the historic tax feat to the ""dogged implementation of strategic reforms over the past two years; a renewed commitment by officers of the service, accompanied by a boosted morale, as well as the innovative deployment of technology for automation of both tax administration and operational processes. This collection was possible through collaboration with our stakeholders, from our colleagues at the executive branch of government to the members of the judiciary, to our brothers and sisters at the National Assembly as well as the tax advisory committee, professional bodies, unions, and most importantly, our taxpayers.""

Nami does not believe that FIRS has already achieved all there is to attain in revenue collection enhancement as he continued: ""We intend to maintain, and even improve on the momentum in 2023. We have peaked, but this is not certainly our peak. In fact, my hope is that this would be the least sum the service would ever collect going forward. Our goal is to identify more areas where we can improve in the delivery and efficiency of our collection, and plug loopholes, while deploying innovative reforms in data and artificial intelligence. Ultimately, we believe that the FIRS can shoulder the responsibility of providing the revenue needed for the governments across the federation to cater for the needs of the Nigerian people through taxes.""

Nami has a word of advice for the three tiers of government - the local, state and federal - if the objective of the FIRS to generate more funds must be fulfilled. They must apply the funds prudently and efficiently to enable the beneficiaries to give back to the society, an action, he hopes, will encourage citizens' compliance in tax payment. ""The reason being that the civilizations you find globally did not fall from heaven. If you go to Europe or the USA and see beautiful airports or roads, it is the government officials that applied taxes that their citizens paid to provide those facilities.","{'uri':

There is so much tension in the country on all fronts.""

""Of course, it is the Holy Month. Two days ago, it was Palm Sunday, a significant moment in the Christian community's observance of Lent, when Christians fast for 40 days and 40 nights, and take on Christ-like conduct and virtues and seek the eye of God. Muslims are also in the Ramadan season, the Holy Month. Both religions preach friendship, understanding, kindness towards the poor, sacrifice and the spirit of sharing and giving. A few days earlier, there was so much talk about traditional worshippers, especially in Lagos state, talking about rituals, placement of sacrificial offerings at crossroads, and yet you say there is so much tension in the country.""

""You have not answered my question. What I know is that every day, Nigerians mouth the mantra that we all worship the same God and that we are all children of God, whoever and whatever we worship. But what I see is a country that has no fear of God. What people do is different from what they say! Religion has failed in this country. We should ban religion.""

""Hey Hey, calm down. Nobody has banned religion in Russia, China, United States or Cuba. Na here you want to ban religion?Human beings are by nature superstitious, but the problem we have in this country is that there is a gap between public morality and private morality. People go to church or the mosque but don't be deceived, they don't care about values, they don't give a damn about virtues, they go to church, the mosques and shrines, they claim we are all serving one God, but you can't see a trace of it in their relationship with other human beings.""

""The language of persons with street credibility. Too much violence, verbal, physical and spiritual in the country of our birth, right now, today, everywhere. Too much ethnic and religious hate and bigotry. I think people are losing their minds because of the elections. And I think we need to remind ourselves that there is a country, and that the country is more important than individual ambitions and preferences.""

""Point of correction. There was a country.""

""There is a country. And there will still be a country. Can we all step out of the mass psychosis that we are dealing with?""

""The psychotics know themselves. The people who have turned election into a source of craze know themselves.""

""Yes. Like your friends in the All Progressives Congress (APC) who are now leaking Peter Obi's telephone conversations, and who claim that he is trying to start a religious war by campaigning on the basis of ethnicity and religion, and they and their allies have put into circulation a doctored version of a telephone conversation between him and Bishop David Oyedepo. Their intent is to ridicule him and lower him in the estimation of serious-minded and reasonable people of society"".

""I don't know who put out any audio conversation, doctored, not doctored. What I know is that there is so much hostility out there because of an election. In the first place, don't believe everything that you see on social media. We are in the age of Artificial Intelligence, ChatGPT and all kinds of manipulations. You must always fact-check.""

""The Labour Party and the Obidients have confirmed that their candidate actually spoke with Bishop David Oyedepo except that the leaked audio is manipulated, fake, doctored. They say there is a plan to arrest Peter Obi for treasonable felony""

""Nobody is above the law. But is that how people are arrested? The people that should be arrested are the people who leaked the phone call between two persons. It is a violation of Section 37 of the 1999 Constitution and all other relevant laws on data protection, consumer protection and freedom of information. People have the right to privacy. That is why there is something called lawyer-client, doctor-patient privilege and confidentiality. If people are allowed to go about leaking other people's private conversations, society will be ruined. Imagine someone for example, hacking into your conversation with your female friends, and sending same to your wife and other girlfriends, you would have instant chaos in your life. Your life expectancy will reduce.""

""That is a wrong analogy. I am a straight and decent man. I am not even a card-carrying politician. But someone told me that we have the right to know everything about people in the public domain, and that it is a good thing to leak everything about politicians.""

""I know what you are saying. Volenti non fit inuria. That is the principle. It does not apply here though. Even politicians have rights. In any case, in the so-called released audio conversation, I don't see anything that is wrong. People are just making a mountain out of a mole-hill. Politicians all over the world play to their base, they mobilise their base, they reach out to persons of influence. Peter Obi calling Bishop Oyedepo, a man of great influence and asking him for support for whatever reason is not an issue. It does not amount to calling for a religious war. It is perfectly within his right to seek celebrity endorsement. In any case, Bishop Oyedepo has shaken it all off. Did you listen to his riposte? He is a man of God. He advises everyone that seeks his counsel, whether they take it or not. Has anybody queried why in the last elections, Muslim clerics supported the Muslim-Muslim ticket? Have they looked for conversations between Muslim candidates and Muslim leaders? Look, the election is over, people who are aggrieved should go to court. The various spokespersons who have been exchanging vitriol over nothing should go and look for work. You can't be a spokesperson for another man permanently. Get busy. Election don finish oh! Boys! Move on!""

""I hear people are looking for appointments, especially within the APC, and that the President-elect is already putting together a team. He is building a team.""

""You mean team-ship?""

""Yes, team-ship. Serious lobbying going on. The other day, it was Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi lobbying openly that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers must be given a core role in the Tinubu government. I hear some people are also already organizing civil society groups to say that they must be in the government. In fact, some men have since abandoned their wives and children and turned themselves into Tinubu's handbags, struggling to make themselves useful. They are with him in France as we speak.""

""The things that hunger, greed and poverty will cause in this country will be serious. But truly, I don't have a problem with the attempt to put a team together. Nigeria can no longer afford a ridiculous situation where a President would be sworn in and for six months, he would claim he is still looking for a team. No. There are urgent matters ahead. The President must hit the ground running. As long as he recruits the best and the brightest, not mediocres, not IOU-seekers, opportunists, habitual drunkards, and second-rate clowns in the corridors of power, I don't have a problem with that.""

""Who is a second-rate clown? A clown is a clown""

""I know what I am saying. Some first-rate clowns in this country are educated billionaires. Don't force me to mention names. If you must recruit a court jester, at least get the good ones. We have had too many jesters running the Nigerian government.""

""But people say Tinubu should wait till the dispute around the Presidential election is resolved.""

""There is nothing in our laws that says so. Section 285 of the 1999 Constitution provides very strict timelines for election petitions. Lawyers exploit this. They will stretch the matter with every possible trick. By May 29, Tinubu would be sworn in. The process has started. He will promptly announce a Cabinet and activate Section 5 of the 1999 Constitution which grants him extensive executive powers to appoint and disappoint. Within a week, a full government would be up and running. You can keep talking to the courts!""

""I don't think that is right""

""It is not a matter of what you think. It is what the law makes possible.""

""We have to change the law. All election disputes must be finalized before inauguration. The Uwais Commission made such a recommendation. We must go back to it. That is what they do in Kenya and other places. Now I understand why some people are calling for an Interim National Government and why one man tried to stop a commercial plane from flying and threatened that there will be no Presidential inauguration on May 29.""

""I hope you also understand that the Department of State Services, and other security agencies have made it clear that anybody who tries to subvert the state, will be made to face the full wrath of the law. Nobody should test the patience of the state-qua-state. Be careful. I won't make a case for you.""

""I don't make trouble with anybody. I have enough issues of my own. I mind my business. I only discuss politics when we are together like this. I raise questions. I am not likely to go on television like Datti Baba-Ahmed to say any attempt to swear in Tinubu would signal the end of democracy, and then get a TV station fined. I will not board a plane like that Obiajulu man and say there will be no inauguration on May 29. I will not act like the Eze Ndigbo of Ajao estate and proclaim that Igbos in Lagos will invite IPOB to Lagos to defend Igbo properties and investments. But we have to understand the context and understand that people are angry.""

""But you know why we are having these issues, because the people do not trust the courts. Not even that musician called Portable, Habeeb Okikiola. When the police went to arrest him, after several invitations and he had snubbed them, he told them that he is a government liability, a celebrity, a Baboon, who belongs to the zoo. Zazuh zeh! That is how many Nigerians behave. They don't trust the system.""

""You don't read the news.? On Friday, he was arrested by the police, and told in clear terms that being a celebrity does not confer any constitutional immunity on him, and that he is truly a government liability and not an asset. He spent the weekend in a police cell in Abeokuta. Yesterday, he was arraigned in a Magistrate Court in Ifo, Ogun State where he was slammed with a three-count charge, and remanded in Ilaro prison until he discharges his bail terms.""

""Nigeria is a wicked place to aspire to be anything.""

""No. Obey the law. The same Portable that was boasting that he is a Baboon. He has been told now that Baboons in the zoo are kept in cages, and he has been kept behind bars accordingly. I hope they lock him up with very gluttonous mosquitoes. In fact, I suspect they did. He was looking very contrite in court. A se ko ti e le. Him no get liver. Egungun better be careful! This is why everybody should be calm. After the elections, everyone should learn to be calm.""

""Make we calm, make we calm down. But there is a way this country also gets on your nerves. People are reacting in their own ways. Look at Rivers state, lawyers who went to Port Harcourt for election matters were arrested and detained, and the materials in their possession were seized. That is enough to make anybody angry.""

""They have been released.""

""So. But a point has been made. Whoever wants to challenge the election results in Rivers State is not welcome and you know what happened on February 25 and March 18 in that state and after the elections, parties across the country have been suspending key officials of their parties from the Peoples' Democratic Party in Benue, the Labour Party in Edo State to the APC in Delta, Kwara, Bauchi and Zamfara States. Some people are just determined to heat up the polity.""

""I am sure if you check the stories from those states very well, you'd see that for the most part, it is mainly about disagreement over ego, stomach infrastructure, and nothing about Nigeria and its future.""

""Even when people try to fight for the future, they are not allowed. I am sure you know that is the way we are.""

""Earlier on, we discussed Tinubu getting ready for the future, you said that was right. In Kano, Governor-elect, Abba Kabir Yusuf of the New Nigeria People's Party (NNPP) has issued two advisories. On March 30, he issued an advisory on ongoing constructions in the state in public spaces and urged that they should be stopped until the incoming administration assumes office. On March 31, he issued another advisory to say that no financial institution should grant any loans to Kano State because the in-coming administration will not honour such loans. He has been told he is jumping the gun. Governor Ganduje has told him that he is still in charge until May 29. I don't understand this country. We are a nation of hypocrites and double standards.""

""To be fair, the Governor-elect of Kano State does not yet have the imprimatur of the law. He is not yet a constituted authority""

""This is the problem then. How can we have a proper country when Nigerians have over 200 million opinions on any subject under the sun and the country's population itself is over 200 million!""","{'uri': 'newsdiaryonline.com',

There is so much tension in the country on all fronts.""

""Of course, it is the Holy Month. Two days ago, it was Palm Sunday, a significant moment in the Christian community's observance of Lent, when Christians fast for 40 days and 40 nights, and take on Christ-like conduct and virtues and seek the eye of God. Muslims are also in the Ramadan season, the Holy Month. Both religions preach friendship, understanding, kindness towards the poor, sacrifice and the spirit of sharing and giving. A few days earlier, there was so much talk about traditional worshippers, especially in Lagos state, talking about rituals, placement of sacrificial offerings at crossroads, and yet you say there is so much tension in the country.""

""You have not answered my question. What I know is that every day, Nigerians mouth the mantra that we all worship the same God and that we are all children of God, whoever and whatever we worship. But what I see is a country that has no fear of God. What people do is different from what they say! Religion has failed in this country. We should ban religion.""

""Hey Hey, calm down. Nobody has banned religion in Russia, China, United States or Cuba. Na here you want to ban religion? Human beings are by nature superstitious, but the problem we have in this country is that there is a gap between public morality and private morality. People go to church or the mosque but don't be deceived, they don't care about values, they don't give a damn about virtues, they go to church, the mosques and shrines, they claim we are all serving one God, but you can't see a trace of it in their relationship with other human beings.""

""Free me. Tell me as you see it.""

""There is too much wawulence in the land.""

""Speak English. What is wawulence?""

""The language of persons with street credibility. Too much violence, verbal, physical and spiritual in the country of our birth, right now, today, everywhere. Too much ethnic and religious hate and bigotry. I think people are losing their minds because of the elections. And I think we need to remind ourselves that there is a country, and that the country is more important than individual ambitions and preferences.""

""Point of correction. There was a country.""

""There is a country. And there will still be a country. Can we all step out of the mass psychosis that we are dealing with?""

""The psychotics know themselves. The people who have turned election into a source of craze know themselves.""

""Yes. Like your friends in the All Progressives Congress (APC) who are now leaking Peter Obi's telephone conversations, and who claim that he is trying to start a religious war by campaigning on the basis of ethnicity and religion, and they and their allies have put into circulation a doctored version of a telephone conversation between him and Bishop David Oyedepo. Their intent is to ridicule him and lower him in the estimation of serious-minded and reasonable people of society"".

""I don't know who put out any audio conversation, doctored, not doctored. What I know is that there is so much hostility out there because of an election. In the first place, don't believe everything that you see on social media. We are in the age of Artificial Intelligence, ChatGPT and all kinds of manipulations. You must always fact-check.""

""The Labour Party and the Obidients have confirmed that their candidate actually spoke with Bishop David Oyedepo except that the leaked audio is manipulated, fake, doctored. They say there is a plan to arrest Peter Obi for treasonable felony""

""Nobody is above the law. But is that how people are arrested? The people that should be arrested are the people who leaked the phone call between two persons. It is a violation of Section 37 of the 1999 Constitution and all other relevant laws on data protection, consumer protection and freedom of information. People have the right to privacy. That is why there is something called lawyer-client, doctor-patient privilege and confidentiality. If people are allowed to go about leaking other people's private conversations, society will be ruined. Imagine someone for example, hacking into your conversation with your female friends, and sending same to your wife and other girlfriends, you would have instant chaos in your life. Your life expectancy will reduce.""

""That is a wrong analogy. I am a straight and decent man. I am not even a card-carrying politician. But someone told me that we have the right to know everything about people in the public domain, and that it is a good thing to leak everything about politicians.""

""I know what you are saying. Volenti non fit inuria. That is the principle. It does not apply here though. Even politicians have rights. In any case, in the so-called released audio conversation, I don't see anything that is wrong. People are just making a mountain out of a mole-hill. Politicians all over the world play to their base, they mobilise their base, they reach out to persons of influence. Peter Obi calling Bishop Oyedepo, a man of great influence and asking him for support for whatever reason is not an issue. It does not amount to calling for a religious war. It is perfectly within his right to seek celebrity endorsement.

In any case, Bishop Oyedepo has shaken it all off. Did you listen to his riposte? He is a man of God. He advises everyone that seeks his counsel, whether they take it or not. Has anybody queried why in the last elections, Muslim clerics supported the Muslim-Muslim ticket? Have they looked for conversations between Muslim candidates and Muslim leaders? Look, the election is over, people who are aggrieved should go to court. The various spokespersons who have been exchanging vitriol over nothing should go and look for work. You can't be a spokesperson for another man permanently. Get busy. Election don finish oh! Boys! Move on!""

""I hear people are looking for appointments, especially within the APC, and that the President-elect is already putting together a team. He is building a team.""

""You mean team-ship?""

""Yes, team-ship. Serious lobbying going on. The other day, it was Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi lobbying openly that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers must be given a core role in the Tinubu government. I hear some people are also already organizing civil society groups to say that they must be in the government. In fact, some men have since abandoned their wives and children and turned themselves into Tinubu's handbags, struggling to make themselves useful. They are with him in France as we speak.""

Read also:OPINION: More notes on the elections

""The things that hunger, greed and poverty will cause in this country will be serious. But truly, I don't have a problem with the attempt to put a team together. Nigeria can no longer afford a ridiculous situation where a President would be sworn in and for six months, he would claim he is still looking for a team. No. There are urgent matters ahead. The President must hit the ground running. As long as he recruits the best and the brightest, not mediocres, not IOU-seekers, opportunists, habitual drunkards, and second-rate clowns in the corridors of power, I don't have a problem with that.""

""Who is a second-rate clown? A clown is a clown""

""I know what I am saying. Some first-rate clowns in this country are educated billionaires. Don't force me to mention names. If you must recruit a court jester, at least get the good ones. We have had too many jesters running the Nigerian government.""

""But people say Tinubu should wait till the dispute around the Presidential election is resolved.""

""There is nothing in our laws that says so. Section 285 of the 1999 Constitution provides very strict timelines for election petitions. Lawyers exploit this. They will stretch the matter with every possible trick. By May 29, Tinubu would be sworn in. The process has started. He will promptly announce a Cabinet and activate Section 5 of the 1999 Constitution which grants him extensive executive powers to appoint and disappoint. Within a week, a full government would be up and running. You can keep talking to the courts!""

""I don't think that is right""

""It is not a matter of what you think. It is what the law makes possible.""

""We have to change the law. All election disputes must be finalized before inauguration. The Uwais Commission made such a recommendation. We must go back to it. That is what they do in Kenya and other places. Now I understand why some people are calling for an Interim National Government and why one man tried to stop a commercial plane from flying and threatened that there will be no Presidential inauguration on May 29.""

""I hope you also understand that the Department of State Services, and other security agencies have made it clear that anybody who tries to subvert the state, will be made to face the full wrath of the law. Nobody should test the patience of the state-qua-state.

Be careful. I won't make a case for you.""

""I don't make trouble with anybody. I have enough issues of my own. I mind my business. I only discuss politics when we are together like this. I raise questions. I am not likely to go on television like Datti Baba-Ahmed to say any attempt to swear in Tinubu would signal the end of democracy, and then get a TV station fined. I will not board a plane like that Obiajulu man and say there will be no inauguration on May 29. I will not act like the Eze Ndigbo of Ajao estate and proclaim that Igbos in Lagos will invite IPOB to Lagos to defend Igbo properties and investments. But we have to understand the context and understand that people are angry.""

""You know I know what you mean by context""

""Yes""

""Eluu Pee""

""Yes Daddy""

""Obi Nwannem""

""Yes Daddy""

""Obi Kererenke, Obi oh""

""Yes Daddy""

""Whoever is not happy, go to Court and fact-check""

""But you know why we are having these issues, because the people do not trust the courts. Not even that musician called Portable, Habeeb Okikiola.

When the police went to arrest him, after several invitations and he had snubbed them, he told them that he is a government liability, a celebrity, a Baboon, who belongs to the zoo. Zazuh zeh! That is how many Nigerians behave. They don't trust the system.""

""But I hope you know what has now happened to him?""

""What happened to the Omo Ijoba himself?""

""You don't read the news.? On Friday, he was arrested by the police, and told in clear terms that being a celebrity does not confer any constitutional immunity on him, and that he is truly a government liability and not an asset. He spent the weekend in a police cell in Abeokuta. Yesterday, he was arraigned in a Magistrate Court in Ifo, Ogun State where he was slammed with a three-count charge, and remanded in Ilaro prison until he discharges his bail terms.""

""Nigeria is a wicked place to aspire to be anything.""

""No. Obey the law. The same Portable that was boasting that he is a Baboon. He has been told now that Baboons in the zoo are kept in cages, and he has been kept behind bars accordingly. I hope they lock him up with very gluttonous mosquitoes. In fact, I suspect they did. He was looking very contrite in court. A se ko ti e le. Him no get liver. Egungun better be careful! This is why everybody should be calm. After the elections, everyone should learn to be calm.""

""Make we calm, make we calm down. But there is a way this country also gets on your nerves. People are reacting in their own ways. Look at Rivers state, lawyers who went to Port Harcourt for election matters were arrested and detained, and the materials in their possession were seized. That is enough to make anybody angry.""

""They have been released.""

""So. But a point has been made. Whoever wants to challenge the election results in Rivers State is not welcome and you know what happened on February 25 and March 18 in that state and after the elections, parties across the country have been suspending key officials of their parties from the Peoples' Democratic Party in Benue, the Labour Party in Edo State to the APC in Delta, Kwara, Bauchi and Zamfara States. Some people are just determined to heat up the polity.""

""I am sure if you check the stories from those states very well, you'd see that for the most part, it is mainly about disagreement over ego, stomach infrastructure, and nothing about Nigeria and its future.""

""Even when people try to fight for the future, they are not allowed. I am sure you know that is the way we are.""

""You tell me.""

""Take Kano State.""

""What about Kano State?""

""Earlier on, we discussed Tinubu getting ready for the future, you said that was right. In Kano, Governor-elect, Abba Kabir Yusuf of the New Nigeria People's Party (NNPP) has issued two advisories. On March 30, he issued an advisory on ongoing constructions in the state in public spaces and urged that they should be stopped until the incoming administration assumes office. On March 31, he issued another advisory to say that no financial institution should grant any loans to Kano State because the in-coming administration will not honour such loans. He has been told he is jumping the gun. Governor Ganduje has told him that he is still in charge until May 29. I don't understand this country. We are a nation of hypocrites and double standards.""

""To be fair, the Governor-elect of Kano State does not yet have the imprimatur of the law. He is not yet a constituted authority""

""Is Tinubu a constituted authority?""

""It is not the same thing. The comparison is off-key.""

""This is the problem then. How can we have a proper country when Nigerians have over 200 million opinions on any subject under the sun and the country's population itself is over 200 million!""

""I don't have an answer to that.""

""I'd be surprised if anybody does.""

This dark portent is vividly reinforced by the newly released 'Amnesty International Report 2022/23: The State of the World's Human Rights.' The report is a wake-up call to all lovers of freedom to intensify efforts against oppression and the erosion of human dignity perpetrated by oppressive governments.

The AI epistle is an explosive double-edged insight. One is the restriction of liberty by authoritarian regimes from Africa to the Middle East, and Europe to Asia. The second is the double standards of the West, which poses as the citadel of freedoms. Though the West is quick to condemn the atrocities of some renegade countries, it demurs when it comes to calling its allies to account for the repression of their people. This has major implications for global liberty.

Instructively, arising from the embers of World War II, 2023 marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose core is the recognition that all people have rights and fundamental freedoms. It is lamentable that those noble ideals are currently under threat despite the progress in human knowledge and technology.

The result is that authorities in 20 of the 156 countries assessed by AI committed war crimes against their own citizens. Governments also deployed unlawful force against peaceful protesters in 85 of the 156 countries (54 per cent). ""Until activists in the West demand the end of double standards on human rights, politicians will always put expediency before principle,"" AI lamented.

Notable instances were cited; from Russia, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the Philippines. Long before it invaded Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin had been ruling Russia with an iron fist. Human rights observance has deteriorated there sharply since February 2022 with media houses summarily shut down, and activists forced to flee the country. In Israel, protests have been raging over judicial 'reforms' that will curtail the power of the Supreme Court. Amnesty accuses Israel of massive human rights violations against Palestinians in the disputed territories.

For most of 2022, unusual protests defined Iran, where women are subjugated socially. Defiance was met with brutal attacks by state agents. As of December, an NGO, Iran Human Rights, counted at least 476 deaths from lethal assaults by security agents; 400 protesters were sentenced to 10-year prison terms. In December, security agents in Peru clamped down viciously on indigenous people and campesinos (peasant farmers).

Castigating the overarching influence of the UN Security Council and its inability to enforce its writ, the AI report accused China of perpetrating wanton ""human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity against Uyghur and other Muslim minorities; (yet) Beijing escaped international condemnation by the UN General Assembly.""

Repression also reigns in Saudi Arabia, where women's rights activists are routinely locked up. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia's military operations in Yemen have cost thousands of lives. Journalists have been imprisoned in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia, Belarus, and dozens of other countries experiencing conflict.

The authorities in Australia, India, and Indonesia have minted new legislations banning demonstrations. In the period under review, Sri Lanka authored emergency powers to suppress demonstrations against spiralling economic turmoil.

Education advocates are under brutal assault in Afghanistan, where the Taliban has arrested, jailed or silenced many activists. Recently, the Taliban arrested girls' education activist, Matiullah Wesa, 30, who had often received threats for his advocacy.

Some states in the United States are moving against freedoms previously enjoyed by Americans, while authorities in the United Kingdom have a new law that gives police officers wide-ranging powers, including the ability to ban ""noisy protests,"" perceived as a threat to the freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.

Women are bearing a serious brunt. In Pakistan, several high-profile murders of women by family members were reported, yet parliament failed to adopt legislation on domestic violence that had been pending since 2021. ""In India, violence against Dalit and Adivasi women, among other caste-based hate crimes, was committed with impunity,"" AI averred.

Closer home, journalists have been locked up serially in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Threats to freedoms have been detailed in Libya, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Eswatini, Guinea, Mali and Senegal. Military coups are back in Africa, causing the suspension of basic rights.

At home, rights violations are rampant. The police brutality that instigated 2020 #EndSARS protest and its brutal suppression by the Nigerian military define the regime of the President, Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Under the former military dictator, Nigerians are experiencing pervasive human rights violations all over again. In 2015, the Army massacred hundreds of the adherents of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria after a clash with the Army in Zaria, Kaduna State. Despite the unconditional release of the IMN leader, Ibrahim el-Zakzaky, ordered by the courts, the government continues to place him and his wife under a travel ban.

Journalists practising in Nigeria are sometimes tormented by the State Security Service and police. Under Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, the National Broadcasting Commission imposes huge fines on media houses. Agba Jalingo, a publisher, was locked up for months on spurious accusations of treason. At least 28 journalists were harassed and attacked during the 2023 general elections, reported the Committee to Protect Journalists. Buhari's trenchant disobedience of court orders has led to the prolonged incarceration of several citizens.

As democratic institutions break down, activists need to wake up to the challenges of the contemporary world. Unlike the past when civil society organisations confronted military dictatorship head-on, their silence these days fuels the excesses of the dictators in the corridors of power masquerading as democrats.","{'uri': 'punchng.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Punch Newspapers', 'description': 'punchng.com - Latest News - Nigeria News - Top Nigerian newspapers - Breaking news - Top news

Taiwo Hassan reports

It's so shocking that at the twilight of President Muhammadu Buhari's administration, the country's agric sector that was once the toast of the administration's top priority has been relegated to the bottom and allowed to face challenges. Consequently, these challenges have resulted to skyrocketing food prices nationwide. In particular, of late, the country's agricultural sector has been besieged with challenges, making the country's food inflation rate rise. However, to make matters worse, the recent cash crunch fueled by the resigned naira by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has also caused further crisis for agric stakeholders.

NIHORT warns

One of the major events that took place in Q1'23, was the National Horticultural Research Institute (NIHORT) warning of the danger in using carbide to ripen bananas and other fruits, saying it had negative health implications The General Manager of NIHORT, Dr. Joel Akinfisoye, gave the warning during a four-day women and youth empowerment programme on horticulture, plantain and banana establishment and telfairia production, in Lafia, Nasarawa State. Akinfisoye stressed the danger in using carbide to ripen fruits for human consumption, saying ""there are simple ways banana ripens easily. Allow the banana to mature from the tree and then tie it in an enclosure that prevents air entry and within a short time, it will ripen naturally.""

NCAM's technologies

Also in the quarter, in a bid to enhance productivity, the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanisation (NCAM) urged smallholder farmers to embraced new technologies at the disposal of the centre. The Acting Executive Director of the centre, Dr AbdulGafar Rasheed- Kamal, made the call while briefing journalists in Abuja. He said that the centre had in fact commenced the production of tractors and other farm implements for smallholder farmers. ""Over 80 per cent of food produced in Nigeria, including those for export, are produced by small holder farmers who lack modern implements to attain food sufficiency, therefore the development would also help achieve national food security,"" he stated. Rasheed-Kamal noted that the NCAM had commenced the production of several farm implements to aid farm produce in line with the mandate of the federal government, through the centre.

Oxfam on profiteering

In the quarter under review, Oxfam, an organisation fighting poverty, disclosed at the World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual conference that food firms making large profits as inflation has risen should be subjected to windfall taxes to help reduce global inequality. Ideally, that was one of the concepts presented in a report by Oxfam International, an organisation that has worked for 10 years to bring inequality to the attention of the political and commercial elites who gathered in the Swiss ski town of Davos. According to Oxfam, the world's super- rich one per cent has amassed almost twice as much wealth in the last two years as the remaining 99 per cent put together.

North East SHFs

insurance claims Another major event that happened in the period was the insurance claims payout for smallholder farmers in the North East where farmlands and products were destroyed by flooding in 2022. Specifically, they were rewarded with N6.9 million insurance claims. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) disclosed that about 245,361 persons in Borno, Adamawa, Yobe and Gombe states were affected by the flooding, and a total 27,339 hectares of farmland was also destroyed. The Chief of Party, Feed the Future Nigeria Rural Resilience Activity, Margarita Aswani, said the claims payoutwas a measure to ""supplement the low yields recorded by farmers in the wet season, due to the flooding that led to the massive destruction of farmlands in the North East.""

Cash crunch

Another major event was the alarm raised by Poultry Farmers Association of Nigeria (PAN) that its members had lost more than N30 billion worth of eggs due to the effect of naira scarcity in the country. The PAN National President, Sunday Onallo-Akpa, disclosed this via a statement issued in Abuja on the protracted challenges facing the poultry sector since the naira by the Federal Government. According to him, ""poultry farmers in the country have lost over 15 million crates of eggs being unsold and are damaged, The average loss to the poultry industry as of this press release is in excess of over N30 billion."" Onallo-Akpa described the poultry industry in Nigeria as one of the most consolidated sub-sectors of Nigeria's agriculture, contributing about 25 per cent of the Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (AGDP) and employing over 25 million Nigerians. Onallo-Akpa, however, alerted that the poultry industry was on the verge of total collapse and extermination because of the negative and devastating consequences of the new currency policy on the industry.

Grains delivery

Moreover, in Q1'23, Ukraine, the Eastern European country, expressed its commitment to delivering about 25,000 tons of grains to Nigeria, despite Russia's full-scale invasion. Ukraine's Minister of Agrarian Policy, Mykola Solskyi, Nigeria's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, and Minister of Agriculture, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Nigeria, Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar, signed the relevant agreement during a Ukrainian delegation's visit to Africa. Grain from Ukraine is a food initiative of Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aimed at providing food to countries that are on the brink of famine, as well as Ukrainian farmers and the economy of Ukraine as a whole. According to the ministry, deliveries will be made despite Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Earlier on December 27, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy announced a tender for the purchase of 59,000 tons of wheat of a quality no lower than the third class, which will be delivered to African and Asian countries as part of the Grain from Ukraine initiative. The Cabinet of Ministers decided to increase humanitarian aid to African and Asian countries by an additional 21,000 tons of corn or wheat grain, thanks to which Sudan, Yemen, Kenya, and Nigeria will receive up to 210,000 tons of grain from Ukraine.

Global food prices

The quarter also revealed that gobal prices for food commodities were on the highest levels in 2022 after falling for nine months in a row. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) attributed this to Russia's war in Ukraine, droughts, and other factors, which drove up inflation and worsened hunger worldwide. The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in the international prices of commonly traded food commodities, dipped by 1.9 per cent in December from a month earlier, the Rome-based organisation said in its latest report. For the whole year, it averaged 143.7 points, more than 14 per cent above the 2021 average, which also saw large increases. World prices of wheat and maize reached record highs over the year. The average value of the FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index for all of 2022 reached a new record high, while the FAO Dairy Price Index and Meat Price Index marked their highest full-year levels since 1990. The FAO Food Price Index averaged 132.4 points in December, 1.0 per cent below its value a year earlier. However, for 2022 as a whole, the index, which tracks monthly changes in the international prices of commonly-traded food commodities, averaged 143.7 points, 14.3 per cent higher than the average value over 2021. Speaking on this, FAO Chief Economist, Mr Maximo Torero, noted that the December number showed that calmer food commodity prices were welcome after two volatile years.

LDCs food security

In March, being the last month of Q1, global leaders and international agric experts agreed that the time had come to weighing the main challenges facing the world's most vulnerable countries- Least Developed Countries (LDC5)- in the areas of promoting agricultural investment and using modern technologies to achieve food security. At the Fifth United Nations (UN) Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDC5), government leaders and experts called for the LDCs to be supported through, among others, promoting agricultural investment and using modern technologies to achieve food security. Among the many challenges they face, the world's least developed countries remain hotspots of chronic and acute food insecurity, with an average prevalence of chronic undernourishment of 22.1 per cent, and in some countries, reaching more than 50 per cent. Despite some progress since 2020, the overall situation has worsened over the past decade due to conflict and climate shocks, as well as economic and demographic pressures. During a panel discussion at LDC5, the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda called for support for LDCs in agricultural and rural development. Duda argued that the LDCs should be helped with implementing various solutions to modernise their domestic agrifood sectors, including artificial intelligence tools, navigation systems, satellite images and digital platforms for farmers. Speaking on climate smart agriculture, Minister of Environment Climate Change and Natural Resources in Gambia, Rohey John Manjang, stated that like many LDCs, The Gambia was mostly an agrarian country, with a large proportion of the population relying on subsistence farming. According to her, the effects of climate change, such as higher temperatures and changing rain patterns, are affecting the productivity of the country's crops, leading to lower yields and reduced incomes for the farmers.

Last line

During the period under review, the performance of the country's agric sector was nothing to write home about as food inflation, cash scarcity, others heralded the quarter.","{'uri':

In the video, he purportedly referred to Africa as ""a cemetery for Africans""

In the video, Putin was seen seated in what appears like a conference room and talking into a microphone.

He purportedly said the following in the video, ""Africa is a cemetery for Africans. When an African becomes rich, his bank accounts are in Switzerland. He travels to France for medical treatment. He buys from Dubai. He consumes Chinese. He prays in Rome or Mecca. His children study in Europe. He travels to Canada, the USA or Europe for Tourism. When he dies, he will be buried in his native country. Africa is a cemetery for Africans; how then can a Cemetery be developed.""

The video has over 200,000 likes and about 10,000 comments, with some stating that Putin made the statement. The video is also being circulated on Whatsapp.

VERIFICATION

Even though the video seems apparently doctored judging from the movement of Putin's lips, Ripples Nigeria scanned the video on Deepware, a software that detects deep fake or AI manipulation in videos. The result returned with 93% deep fake detected.

Also, media searches did not show any evidence of Putin ever making such a statement.

In addition, apart from the fact that Putin very rarely speaks English in public, the voice in the video is not Putin's, and the Russian President is not as fluent in English as the voice in the video.

Darkness covers the face of the deep and the unquiet Spirit is hovering over the land. Africa's most populous country is at a fresh dangerous crossroads. At the beginning when darkness covered the earth, God said: ''Let there be Light,'' and there was light. Now, Nigeria needs a leader who will command light to outshine the country's darkness and exorcise the unquiet spirit. Once a country returns to factory-reset mode or Hobbes's state of nature: Optimism, Peace and Hope disappear, none of our important human needs is reliably realizable in such a milieu.

Indeed, the perfect storm is already gathering, killer herdsmen have since cut short their vacation, they visited an IDP camp in Benue state and massacred over 128 internally displaced people mostly pregnant women and children recently, before zooming off to Sokoto, they had a stopover in Kaduna where reckless kidnapping and killings took place. The DSS came out publicly to declare that the State of the Union is fragile as some VIPs are scheming for something strange to the constitution, threatening that the price of holding the May 29th change of baton event amounts to the death of democracy! Those calling for an interim government seem to be suffering from amnesia, I believe. How productive and stable was Nigeria in 1993 under Chief Ernest Shonekan as Head of ING? Even though protest is part of democracy but due to our peculiarities, unbridled protests at this perilous time can snowball into an uncontrollable disaster. Political protests in a nation-state can bring about a positive change or in some cases, revolution: France, Russia, and Sri Lanka as case studies. However, in a fragile heterogeneous society like Nigeria, political protests often lead to civil war: Ivory Coast, Syria, Rwanda and Fiji as case studies. The youths are fragmented along the nation's fault lines, which is why the elites must be circumspect in their utterances. Somalia began like this before it became a failed state bereft of a central authority. The court remains the last hope of all aggrieved politicians.

No doubt, Nigerians are hurting for various reasons, how long can we run away from discussing the Nigeria Question? To achieve a peaceful, prosperous and stable Nigeria (PPSN), we need to balance the national equation by either allowing: (a) credible, free and fair elections, or (b) equitable sharing of power among the nationalities, regions and religions in an unadulterated federation, (America model) or (C) considerable autonomy for each nationality in a loose confederation, (Switzerland spec) or (d) self-determination through a referendum for nationalities that desire to exit the union (Czechoslovakia option). Therefore, PPSN= A or B. But where A & B are unavailable or impossible, C or D may become inevitable.

Nigeria faces four possibilities today: Breakout, Breakeven, Bronze or Breakdown. Differently put, Nigeria can become a Gold Medallist (i.e. become Great) or a Silver Medallist (i.e. Good) or Bronze Medallist (3rd world) or Grounded (failed State, CKD- Completely Knocked Down) depending on the choices we make today. To achieve a breakout requires abundant decentralization with a new people's constitution that contains a referendum clause. This will put an end to the do-or-die struggle for power at the Centre, reduce corruption and wastage, and enthrone accountability and healthy competition among the federating regions. There is no heterogeneous society anywhere or at any time in history that is governed centrally the way Nigeria is, that escaped circular crises, retrogression and eventual disintegration. The lifespan of severely mismanaged countries is about 70 years! The early bird civilization, Europe, fought themselves to a standstill for 100 years before they embraced restructuring, which begot relative peace and unprecedented prosperity. China, South Korea, Singapore, Norway, UAE etc. are new gold medalists.

The second possibility is breakeven (Silver medal). Through a comprehensive reconstruction of the economy's architecture, running a lean government (e.g. sales of all government assets starting with NNPC, etc. This will reduce corruption by 80% as governance would depend solely on an effective taxation regime. Square pegs would go inside square holes when the government exits the business. Businesses in Scandinavian countries pay up to 50% tax on net profit which enables them to build an egalitarian society with the lowest crime rate in the world. Thailand, India, Turkey etc. are silver medalists.

To win the bronze medal, Nigeria needs to strengthen her institutions, deepen the rule of law, modernize her infrastructure and build harmonious bridges across various nationalities and boost productivity, tame corruption. Rwanda, Bulgaria, and Indonesia are some examples bronze medalists.

The fourth possibility is CKDN - Completely Knocked Down Nigeria, i.e. Breakdown/ Grounded, enmeshed in unwinnable, forever war. Failed states like Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Venezuela (with the world's highest oil reserves of over 300 billion barrels) Somalia, Afghanistan etc. behaved like an ostrich for too long, ignoring the signals, sound and odour of disintegration. America's CIA had strongly warned Nigeria in 2015 about CKDN! The incoming administration should, instead of continuing to administer ""pain-killer drugs"", go for a ""pain-remover surgical operation""! Nigeria's vital organs (liver, kidney, eyes, lung and heart) are all too weak and failing, pumping Nigeria with more ''Panadol'' or 'Panadol Extra' will ultimately lead to stroke. Nigeria should be wheeled immediately to the emergency theatre for a ''pain-remover surgical operation''.

*Lessons from Breakout Nations*!

All breakout nations got four variables right simultaneously: workable structure, sound strategy, competent leadership, and ethically ''born-again'' population. Nigeria's emphasis has been largely on strategy: visions 2000, 2010, and 2020, the 7-point agenda of YarAdua, the Transformation agenda of Jonathan and the 63-point agenda of the Buhari administration- ignoring the other three variables. The result has been repeated failures and frustrations. There is also the Leadership illusion, i.e. that all Nigeria needs to become a gold medallist is just one 'Messiah'. No. For any country to win a gold medal, those four variables must be present.

Nigeria cannot be great without a Cultural Revolution, i.e. national rebirth coupled with structural reforms. Everyone seems unhappy about Nigeria's stunted growth, pointing accusing fingers. The university dons who practice sex for marks, the media empire who built their wealth on blackmail and cash-for-awards, the spare parts importers who import substandard spare parts from China that cause road accidents and deaths, the Pharmacists that import fake drugs from India leading to an outbreak of diabetes and kidney failures, the businessmen who became rich on fraudulent fuel subsidy and kick back on tax weavers, the Pastors and Imams who use offerings and tithes and gifts meant for the general wellbeing of their members and the society to buy private jets and marry 4 wives, the Yahoo Yahoo! Youths, the corrupt civil servants who pocket 80% of the contract sum as kick-backs, the artisans and market women who abuse customers trust, the disabled people on the road who help criminals hide their guns and the terrorists among us are all complaining about the sorry situation Nigeria without first removing the log in their own eyes. Before their respective cultural revolutions, life was short, brutish and nasty in both China and South Korea. We urgently need to have a conversation on national rebirth as a people.

*10 +1 Commandments for the President-elect*

1 Thou shall not remove the remaining fuel subsidy until you have substantially removed the youth's pains.

2 There is an urgent need to embark on the following 7Rs: reconciliation, recalibration, rebirth, re-education, re-industrialization, re-construction and rebranding.

Remember that Czar Nicholas 11 (1868- 1918) crowned in 1894 was the last Russian emperor. He was stubborn and underestimated the hunger and anger of the Russians after WW1, he ignored the signals and sounds of the hopelessness of Russians by refusing to carry out necessary and quick economic reforms that would bring abundance and hope to his people. Thus Nicholas 11 was forced to abdicate on March 15th, 1817, through popular uprising and on July 17th, 1918, Emperor Nicholas and his entire family and their closest associates were gruesomely murdered, and their remains soaked with acid and burnt, thus ending the 300-year-old Romanov's dynasty rule.

3 Thou shall not fill your Cabinet with recycled, corrupt political jobbers.

Allow those ''flying CVs'' to remain in the air forever. Those who can make Nigeria a peak performer and Gold medalist are already too busy to be flying their CVs around. Getting them would only be through headhunting and serious persuasion. Those corrupt, recycled characters lobbying to serve have little or nothing to offer since Nigeria became the world's poverty capital under their watch, they don't deserve a second chance.

4 Thou shall prioritize meritocracy. Nothing is wrong in advertising certain critical cabinet positions such as Ministers of Finance, Education, ICT, Solid Minerals and Petroleum

5 Thou shall not appoint yourself as Petroleum Minister. Presidents OBJ and PMB did it, they both failed.

Of all the OPEC countries, Nigeria is the only one that does oil business at a loss. Nigeria has the lowest per capita income and weakest national currency among the major oil exporting countries. Prosperity is a rule among OPEC countries except Nigeria. In 45 years, Nigeria recorded profits only in two years but it was *rat profits* For instance, Saudi Arabia posted a whopping profit of $161 billion in 2022.Norway (average sales of 1.2mbd) has in her Sovereign Wealth a gargantuan sum of $1.3Trillion, and in 2020 during C-19 when Nigerians were severely hurting and hungry, Norway realised the sum of $180billion profit from her oil investments dividends in technology companies. Here is a simple example of national insanity: Nigeria's total profits from her sales of oil in 45 years were N287 billion in 2020 and N674 billion in 2021 i.e. N961 billion or $1.2billion (@N750:$1) gross. The total money in the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) is about N1.02 Trillion (i.e. $1.2 billion vs Norway's $1.3 trillion, less than 1% of Norway's Sovereign wealth.

The advertisement for the position of Petroleum Minister should read: *Nigeria needs a person who can bring the cost of sales and profit per barrel of crude oil exploration and processing to be at par or close to that of Norway, Saudi Arabia or UAE, plus or minus 20% environmental exigencies* What is wrong with headhunting Norway's Minister of Petroleum and Energy (Terje Aasland) as the next Nigeria's Minister of Petroleum, under a management contract of 90:10 profit sharing in favour of Nigeria? He made about $90 billion selling 1.2mbd for Norway in 2022. After all, we have people from the Niger Republic holding sensitive public offices in Nigeria. Conversely, we have had Nigerians as Ministers of Economy in Togo and Justice in the Gambia. And Nigerians are holding sensitive cabinet positions in America and the UK.

6 Thou shall create two new Ministries: Ministry of Future to be headed by a Nigeria prodigy, likely under 30 years of age. Two, the Ministry of Renewable Energy. The future would be dominated by Space innovations and Artificial Intelligence (Ai). The bus is already moving, our youths cannot afford to be bus conductors, they should be in the front seat of the 4.0 revolution. Furthermore, the market value of the renewable energy business is forecast to be more than $ 2 trillion by 2030, whereas oil has less than 40 years before it becomes satchet water.

7 Thou shall abolish the office of *Aso Rock CABAL* because it is unconstitutional and anti people.The ''cabal'' engineered the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election according to IBB. GEJ's Cabal made him clueless. PMB's Cabal held him, hostage, in the Villa according to PMB's wife, Aisha Buhari. Allowing your closest political and business associates, the Vice President or your wife or son or daughter to form a new cabal is like signing an irrevocable MoU with failure, because the ''Cabal'' is not on record for positive contributions.

8 Foreign Policy: thou shall not drag Nigeria into the China-America-Russia supremacy battle. There is a window of commercial opportunity worth $250 billion in the energy sector that has opened up in Europe as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war which the incoming administration can harvest. The geopolitics sands are shifting but smart nations like Israel are playing it safe: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is smartly cutting deals with Russia' Putin, China Xi and America's Biden simultaneously without dropping any of the 3 balls for the overall benefits of his people.

9 Thou shall not waste the Globalization crisis: There is a gradual sunset on globalization: Japan is relocating most of its factories from China to Japan. America is building a new semiconductor factory in Arizona, as I write, to reduce its vulnerability in Asia which controls 70% of the global semiconductor output, Germany is looking inward for its energy needs etc. Today, Regionalization and nationalism are coming back as valedictory services are being held for Globalisation, even in her home country, America. Nigeria should optimize the AfCFTA opportunities, as most of what Nigeria needs to succeed can be found inside her ''Sokoto'', why travel to Sokoto?10 Global hunger crisis is real: thou shall prioritize food security from day one: an empty sack cannot stand. Globally, 10% of the population has little or nothing to eat and 70% of them are in Africa. About 133 million Nigerians are living below the poverty line. However, there is zero chance of solving the food crisis in Nigeria without first addressing the security challenges posed by the Fulani herdsmen. The Vice President's (Shettima) first task should be to head the ANTI-TERRORISM TASK FORCE (ATTF) that will end terrorism in Nigeria within your first 100 days in office.

10+1: Thou shall not complain: likely, you would soon lose two vital things: sleep and smiles! As you peruse Aso Rock's ''top secret'' books, which would most likely be like a horror movie with stomach-churning violence. Every country has ''classified information'' meant for the C-in-C eyes only. My intellectual guess is that the horror movie would contain scary graphic details of Nigeria's deplorable basket of trouble, e.g. the high debt profile, NNPC woes and possible bankruptcy of Nigeria within months, not years, the implication of a 40% youth unemployment rate, list of untouchable VIPS behind oil bunkering and political terrorism. The reason behind the dubious CBN complicated naira exchange rates and those profiteering from it, details of irrevocable agreements to service with China and the West. There will also be pressure from the World Bank and America on the removal of the remaining fuel subsidy, caustic antagonism from different quarters for different reasons and how to fulfil the election IoUs which you gave to different power blocks, etc., etc.

Poverty and pains have no equilibrium, therefore, the situation can even get worse with the possibility of a cascading crisis within the first 100 days, as it happened in 1999 when OBJ took over and in 2011 with GEJ. Nonetheless, be strong, courageous, and audacious. Thou shall not complain, for thou waited, toiled and prayed for 30 years, now is your hour, seize the moment.

To fix Nigeria is like cooking stones for dinner, the water and the fire dry up quickly, yet the stones remain uncooked and squeezing water out of the stone becomes impracticable! The statistics is scary but true: 30% of the past ''Nigeria's chef'' expired suddenly or got violently killed on duty, another 30% were forcefully and unceremoniously disgraced out of the kitchen while the reaming 40% are still baffled (some incapacitated) till today asking ''what went wrong, how and why did I fail''. It is like a zero-sum game for Nigeria's chef. Worse still, the outgoing administration has used the last political ''LIFELINE''. The youths are tired of the Aso-Rock sermon of *dinner-not-ready, they want DINNER NOW*!

In all this, there is hope, transforming a complex country is not rocket science, it is doable. In recent world history, three outstanding leaders found themselves in similar situations and seized the moment, and against all odds, squeezed the water out of stones. However, the three didn't loot the treasury and didn't allow their associates to loot. Indeed, they killed their kleptomaniac associates. They practiced meritocracy. My favourite books in my library are Ben Gurion, the man who created Israel, The Story of Singapore by Lee Kuan Yew and Deng Xiaoping and The Transformation of China. Unarguably, Gurion, LKY and Deng were nothing short of miracle workers. Can we replicate what happened in China, Singapore and Israel in Nigeria? Yes.

*Pathway to Silver or Bronze Medals*

Smart nations are run the way Apple or Google run their businesses. There are five questions which smart transformative CEOs ask when trying to make an Elephant dance. Nigeria needs to ask those five questions as well. One, what is left on the table that Nigeria can grab quickly and use as a stepping stone, or make better- X+1?

Two, what is coming next on the horizon that we can enjoy the ""first-mover advantage""? Three, what capability as a nation do we have?

Four, what capabilities do we need?

Five, how do we get there from here? All smart nations (South Korea, India, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Israel, UAE, Sweden, Norway, Germany etc. without exception built their respective successes on those five pillars.

Indian elites took a bet on software as a business (the first India Institute of Technology- IIT, was established in 1951, in Kharagpur). Today, Indians in the diaspora remit over $100 billion yearly back home and most of the global technology companies are run by Indians. Taiwan bet on chip making and established the world's first semiconductor foundry, TSMC in 1987. Today, no Taiwan, no civilization! South Korea's economy runs on five legs: electronics, telecommunications, automobile manufacturing, shipbuilding and steel. Today, Samsung Electronics alone contributes about 17% to the GDP of South Korea, realizing $246 billion in 2022, i.e. more than five times Nigeria's yearly oil revenue. China zeroed in on building competence in the Global Supply Chain. Within 30 years, China went from zero to hero. Of the 100 countries I have studied in the last 10 years, the Thailand model fascinated me greatly. Thailand with about 70,000 villages, set up what is called ''ONE TOMBON, ONE PRODUCT'', with a beautiful slogan- 'Local Wisdom, Goes Global'. Each village (Tombon) has a product (based on their cultural and environmental competitive advantage) that they focus on and each village builds an ecosystem for backward and forward integration around it. Nigeria can start with the 774 local government councils: *One Council, One Product*- *OCOP*. For instance, the Benin people are the world's best of all time in Bronze making, we need to build a Bronze making industry ecosystem there in, for export. This can fetch over $1billon yearly income.

*Questions & Answers for Nigeria*

1 What is left?

Answer: There are four major revolutions on going as I write: Electric Vehicles Revolution, (EVR), Space innovations, 4.0 skills, and Global Food crisis affecting 800 million hungry people worldwide. Those four problems constitute the new opportunities.

2 What's next?

Answer: Space commercialization, Defence innovations, Artificial intelligence solutions, Medical breakthrough in incurable diseases, Climate change solutions, currencies innovations.

3 What capabilities does Nigeria have: robust population of 220million with 52% youths, 40% arable land, a huge diaspora population, Dangote, and about 270 types of mineral and natural resources (only Chinese know the exact numbers, locations, and quantities and quality- I am not exaggerating!), Atlantic Ocean, Sambisa Forest, Lagos, AfCFTA, abundant sun and favorable climate, Diverse nationalities, untapped Africa market, etc.

4 What capabilities do we need?

Answer: rebirth, recalibration, elite consensus, re-industrialization, youth employment, infrastructural modernization, technology solutions to combat desert encroachment in the North and purposeful leadership, etc.

5 How do we get there from here?

Answer: Electrical vehicles are the future, by 2030, Europe will stop the production of vehicles using gasoline. By 2032, 75% of American vehicles will be EVs. Interestingly,Nigeria is one of the few countries in the world that has all the eight mineral resources required to build a complete ecosystem for EV manufacturing: Cobalt in Kano, Lithium, Nickel, Cooper, Graphite, Zinc, Manganese and Rare Earths. They are all available in Kaduna, Nasarawa, Kogi, Plateau, Benue, Borno, Adamawa, Kebbi, Cross Rivers Katsina and Ekiti.

There will be an unusual quantum leap in EVs businesses.

Nigeria should build a new ''renewable energy hub'' that will employ over a million youths within the next two years through private initiatives. The leading global battery supplier, CATL which controls 34% of the world's EV batteries should be invited to site its factory in Nigeria for the European market fulfilment. Nigeria is closer to Europe than China. And instead of the crude ways Chinese employ currently to steal some of there mineral resources that is the source of unending communal crisis in some part of Nigeria, let us sit down with the Chinese to stop the *Monkey Business* and let us do a clean and proper win- win EVs related businesses, going forward.

The global electric car market was valued at $229b in 2021 and is projected to reach $700 billion in 2030 growing at 17.30% yearly.

Another one million youths can be absorbed and become gainfully employed through innovative and customized JAPA INITIATIVES plus the New Business Process Outsourcing package (NBPO), using the instrumentality of 4.0 industrial revolutions solutions and skills. From NBPO, Nigeria can begin to earn up to $ 50 billion in inflows from June 2024 I.e. *delicious food is ready within 12 months* The Philippines is number two globally in BPO, and India is number one. Nigeria can be number three: *the youths are ready when the government is ready* There is no better sector to invest in the $800 million World Bank grant than NBPO (RoI is massive and fast, with no competition). Concomitantly, Nigeria would need to create two new banks: Nigeria Start-Ups Bank (NSB) and Nigeria Diaspora Bank (NDB). The existing banking solutions are not enough to harvest the emerging massive opportunities in the ongoing professional demographics shifts.

To fix another one million unemployed youths, the 800 million hungry population worldwide need food, food, and food. Using the latest precision agricultural technology, Nigeria's Middle Belt can feed half of the world's hungry people profitably, when and if the heads men killings stop.

We also need to get Dangote Refinery up and running since yesterday to conserve 70% of our dollars spent on fuel importation.

Even if the federal government has to take additional 20% equity (but transparently valued this time around), the risk is worth taking. The Dangote ecosystem would take about 500,000 Nigerians out of poverty including market women selling table water and nuts to the staff of the refinery. Dangote must work and walk, NOW!

All said Nigeria can fix 5 million youths in quality, high-paying jobs within the next 24 months, generate a fresh $50 billion revenue inflow from innovative programs aiming at assisting the naira gain a full erection and reflate the economy. Before the C-19 pandemic, one company in Taiwan had about 0ne million employees (5% of the population) on its payroll. Just one company! In 2022, Walmart had about 2.3 million employees and realized a revenue of $ 600 billion. Nigeria's environment should be made fertile for mega businesses to germinate and thrive, where the likes of Foxconn and Walmart would be replicated here

Africa has been anxiously waiting for the Elephant (Nigeria) in the room to arise and dance, likewise the entire black race. Nigeria cannot afford to continue to move in circles like the Barber's chair. Nations perish for lack of three things: knowledge, vision and political will. Everything is possible, including winning a GOLD, Silver, Bronz or CKD medals, depending on the choices we make today!

Going forward, let us reason, talk and choose wisely, for all we have is this tiny but fantastically blessed 923,768 sq. km piece of land in the Cosmos filled with milk and honey, sugar, chess and butter plus! Paradoxically, Nigerians scarcely cherish their own country. While globally, Nigerians are viewed pitiably, secretly, however, our land is the envy of all- no competition. None.

Darkness covers the face of the deep and the unquiet Spirit is hovering over the land. Africa's most populous country is at a fresh dangerous crossroads. At the beginning when darkness covered the earth, God said: ''Let there be Light,'' and there was light. Now, Nigeria needs a leader who will command light to outshine the country's darkness and exorcise the unquiet spirit. Once a country returns to factory-reset mode or Hobbes's state of nature: Optimism, Peace and Hope disappear, none of our important human needs is reliably realizable in such a milieu.

Indeed, the perfect storm is already gathering, killer herdsmen have since cut short their vacation, they visited an IDP camp in Benue state and massacred over 128 internally displaced people mostly pregnant women and children recently, before zooming off to Sokoto, they had a stopover in Kaduna where reckless kidnapping and killings took place. The DSS came out publicly to declare that the State of the Union is fragile as some VIPs are scheming for something strange to the constitution, threatening that the price of holding the May 29th change of baton event amounts to the death of democracy! Those calling for an interim government seem to be suffering from amnesia, I believe. How productive and stable was Nigeria in 1993 under Chief Ernest Shonekan as Head of ING? Even though protest is part of democracy but due to our peculiarities, unbridled protests at this perilous time can snowball into an uncontrollable disaster. Political protests in a nation-state can bring about a positive change or in some cases, revolution: France, Russia, and Sri Lanka as case studies. However, in a fragile heterogeneous society like Nigeria, political protests often lead to civil war: Ivory Coast, Syria, Rwanda and Fiji as case studies. The youths are fragmented along the nation's fault lines, which is why the elites must be circumspect in their utterances. Somalia began like this before it became a failed state bereft of a central authority. The court remains the last hope of all aggrieved politicians.

No doubt, Nigerians are hurting for various reasons, how long can we run away from discussing the Nigeria Question? To achieve a peaceful, prosperous and stable Nigeria (PPSN), we need to balance the national equation by either allowing: (a) credible, free and fair elections, or (b) equitable sharing of power among the nationalities, regions and religions in an unadulterated federation, (America model) or (C) considerable autonomy for each nationality in a loose confederation, (Switzerland spec) or (d) self-determination through a referendum for nationalities that desire to exit the union (Czechoslovakia option). Therefore, PPSN= A or B. But where A & B are unavailable or impossible, C or D may become inevitable.

Nigeria faces four possibilities today: Breakout, Breakeven, Bronze or Breakdown. Differently put, Nigeria can become a Gold Medallist (i.e. become Great) or a Silver Medallist (i.e. Good) or Bronze Medallist (3rd world) or Grounded (failed State, CKD- Completely Knocked Down) depending on the choices we make today. To achieve a breakout requires abundant decentralization with a new people's constitution that contains a referendum clause. This will put an end to the do-or-die struggle for power at the Centre, reduce corruption and wastage, and enthrone accountability and healthy competition among the federating regions. There is no heterogeneous society anywhere or at any time in history that is governed centrally the way Nigeria is, that escaped circular crises, retrogression and eventual disintegration. The lifespan of severely mismanaged countries is about 70 years! The early bird civilization, Europe, fought themselves to a standstill for 100 years before they embraced restructuring, which begot relative peace and unprecedented prosperity. China, South Korea, Singapore, Norway, UAE etc. are new gold medalists.

The second possibility is breakeven (Silver medal). Through a comprehensive reconstruction of the economy's architecture, running a lean government (e.g. sales of all government assets starting with NNPC, etc. This will reduce corruption by 80% as governance would depend solely on an effective taxation regime. Square pegs would go inside square holes when the government exits the business. Businesses in Scandinavian countries pay up to 50% tax on net profit which enables them to build an egalitarian society with the lowest crime rate in the world. Thailand, India, Turkey etc. are silver medalists.

To win the bronze medal, Nigeria needs to strengthen her institutions, deepen the rule of law, modernize her infrastructure and build harmonious bridges across various nationalities and boost productivity, tame corruption. Rwanda, Bulgaria, and Indonesia are some examples bronze medalists.

The fourth possibility is CKDN - Completely Knocked Down Nigeria, i.e. Breakdown/ Grounded, enmeshed in unwinnable, forever war. Failed states like Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Venezuela (with the world's highest oil reserves of over 300 billion barrels) Somalia, Afghanistan etc. behaved like an ostrich for too long, ignoring the signals, sound and odour of disintegration. America's CIA had strongly warned Nigeria in 2015 about CKDN! The incoming administration should, instead of continuing to administer ""pain-killer drugs"", go for a ""pain-remover surgical operation""! Nigeria's vital organs (liver, kidney, eyes, lung and heart) are all too weak and failing, pumping Nigeria with more ''Panadol'' or 'Panadol Extra' will ultimately lead to stroke. Nigeria should be wheeled immediately to the emergency theatre for a ''pain-remover surgical operation''.

Lessons from Breakout Nations!

All breakout nations got four variables right simultaneously: workable structure, sound strategy, competent leadership, and ethically ''born-again'' population. Nigeria's emphasis has been largely on strategy: visions 2000, 2010, and 2020, the 7-point agenda of YarAdua, the Transformation agenda of Jonathan and the 63-point agenda of the Buhari administration- ignoring the other three variables. The result has been repeated failures and frustrations. There is also the Leadership illusion, i.e. that all Nigeria needs to become a gold medallist is just one 'Messiah'. No. For any country to win a gold medal, those four variables must be present.

Nigeria cannot be great without a Cultural Revolution, i.e. national rebirth coupled with structural reforms. Everyone seems unhappy about Nigeria's stunted growth, pointing accusing fingers. The university dons who practice sex for marks, the media empire who built their wealth on blackmail and cash-for-awards, the spare parts importers who import substandard spare parts from China that cause road accidents and deaths, the Pharmacists that import fake drugs from India leading to an outbreak of diabetes and kidney failures, the businessmen who became rich on fraudulent fuel subsidy and kick back on tax weavers, the Pastors and Imams who use offerings and tithes and gifts meant for the general wellbeing of their members and the society to buy private jets and marry 4 wives, the Yahoo Yahoo! Youths, the corrupt civil servants who pocket 80% of the contract sum as kick-backs, the artisans and market women who abuse customers trust, the disabled people on the road who help criminals hide their guns and the terrorists among us are all complaining about the sorry situation Nigeria without first removing the log in their own eyes. Before their respective cultural revolutions, life was short, brutish and nasty in both China and South Korea. We urgently need to have a conversation on national rebirth as a people.

10 +1 Commandments for the President-elect

1 Thou shall not remove the remaining fuel subsidy until you have substantially removed the youth's pains.

2 There is an urgent need to embark on the following 7Rs: reconciliation, recalibration, rebirth, re-education, re-industrialization, re-construction and rebranding.

Remember that Czar Nicholas 11 (1868- 1918) crowned in 1894 was the last Russian emperor. He was stubborn and underestimated the hunger and anger of the Russians after WW1, he ignored the signals and sounds of the hopelessness of Russians by refusing to carry out necessary and quick economic reforms that would bring abundance and hope to his people. Thus Nicholas 11 was forced to abdicate on March 15th, 1817, through popular uprising and on July 17th, 1918, Emperor Nicholas and his entire family and their closest associates were gruesomely murdered, and their remains soaked with acid and burnt, thus ending the 300-year-old Romanov's dynasty rule.

3 Thou shall not fill your Cabinet with recycled, corrupt political jobbers.

Allow those ''flying CVs'' to remain in the air forever. Those who can make Nigeria a peak performer and Gold medalist are already too busy to be flying their CVs around. Getting them would only be through headhunting and serious persuasion. Those corrupt, recycled characters lobbying to serve have little or nothing to offer since Nigeria became the world's poverty capital under their watch, they don't deserve a second chance.

4 Thou shall prioritize meritocracy. Nothing is wrong in advertising certain critical cabinet positions such as Ministers of Finance, Education, ICT, Solid Minerals and Petroleum

5 Thou shall not appoint yourself as Petroleum Minister. Presidents OBJ and PMB did it, they both failed.

Of all the OPEC countries, Nigeria is the only one that does oil business at a loss. Nigeria has the lowest per capita income and weakest national currency among the major oil exporting countries. Prosperity is a rule among OPEC countries except Nigeria. In 45 years, Nigeria recorded profits only in two years but it was *rat profits* For instance, Saudi Arabia posted a whopping profit of $161 billion in 2022.Norway (average sales of 1.2mbd) has in her Sovereign Wealth a gargantuan sum of $1.3Trillion, and in 2020 during C-19 when Nigerians were severely hurting and hungry, Norway realised the sum of $180billion profit from her oil investments dividends in technology companies. Here is a simple example of national insanity: Nigeria's total profits from her sales of oil in 45 years were N287 billion in 2020 and N674 billion in 2021 i.e. N961 billion or $1.2billion (@N750:$1) gross. The total money in the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) is about N1.02 Trillion (i.e. $1.2 billion vs Norway's $1.3 trillion, less than 1% of Norway's Sovereign wealth.

The advertisement for the position of Petroleum Minister should read: *Nigeria needs a person who can bring the cost of sales and profit per barrel of crude oil exploration and processing to be at par or close to that of Norway, Saudi Arabia or UAE, plus or minus 20% environmental exigencies* What is wrong with headhunting Norway's Minister of Petroleum and Energy (Terje Aasland) as the next Nigeria's Minister of Petroleum, under a management contract of 90:10 profit sharing in favour of Nigeria? He made about $90 billion selling 1.2mbd for Norway in 2022. After all, we have people from the Niger Republic holding sensitive public offices in Nigeria.

Conversely, we have had Nigerians as Ministers of Economy in Togo and Justice in the Gambia. And Nigerians are holding sensitive cabinet positions in America and the UK.

6 Thou shall create two new Ministries: Ministry of Future to be headed by a Nigeria prodigy, likely under 30 years of age. Two, the Ministry of Renewable Energy. The future would be dominated by Space innovations and Artificial Intelligence (Ai). The bus is already moving, our youths cannot afford to be bus conductors, they should be in the front seat of the 4.0 revolution. Furthermore, the market value of the renewable energy business is forecast to be more than $ 2 trillion by 2030, whereas oil has less than 40 years before it becomes satchet water.

7 Thou shall abolish the office of *Aso Rock CABAL* because it is unconstitutional and anti people.The ''cabal'' engineered the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election according to IBB. GEJ's Cabal made him clueless. PMB's Cabal held him, hostage, in the Villa according to PMB's wife, Aisha Buhari. Allowing your closest political and business associates, the Vice President or your wife or son or daughter to form a new cabal is like signing an irrevocable MoU with failure, because the ''Cabal'' is not on record for positive contributions.

8 Foreign Policy: thou shall not drag Nigeria into the China-America-Russia supremacy battle. There is a window of commercial opportunity worth $250 billion in the energy sector that has opened up in Europe as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war which the incoming administration can harvest. The geopolitics sands are shifting but smart nations like Israel are playing it safe: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is smartly cutting deals with Russia' Putin, China Xi and America's Biden simultaneously without dropping any of the 3 balls for the overall benefits of his people.

9 Thou shall not waste the Globalization crisis: There is a gradual sunset on globalization: Japan is relocating most of its factories from China to Japan. America is building a new semiconductor factory in Arizona, as I write, to reduce its vulnerability in Asia which controls 70% of the global semiconductor output, Germany is looking inward for its energy needs etc. Today, Regionalization and nationalism are coming back as valedictory services are being held for Globalisation, even in her home country, America. Nigeria should optimize the AfCFTA opportunities, as most of what Nigeria needs to succeed can be found inside her ''Sokoto'', why travel to Sokoto?

10 Global hunger crisis is real: thou shall prioritize food security from day one: an empty sack cannot stand. Globally, 10% of the population has little or nothing to eat and 70% of them are in Africa. About 133 million Nigerians are living below the poverty line. However, there is zero chance of solving the food crisis in Nigeria without first addressing the security challenges posed by the Fulani herdsmen. The Vice President's (Shettima) first task should be to head the ANTI-TERRORISM TASK FORCE (ATTF) that will end terrorism in Nigeria within your first 100 days in office.

10+1: Thou shall not complain: likely, you would soon lose two vital things: sleep and smiles! As you peruse Aso Rock's ''top secret'' books, which would most likely be like a horror movie with stomach-churning violence. Every country has ''classified information'' meant for the C-in-C eyes only. My intellectual guess is that the horror movie would contain scary graphic details of Nigeria's deplorable basket of trouble, e.g. the high debt profile, NNPC woes and possible bankruptcy of Nigeria within months, not years, the implication of a 40% youth unemployment rate, list of untouchable VIPS behind oil bunkering and political terrorism. The reason behind the dubious CBN complicated naira exchange rates and those profiteering from it, details of irrevocable agreements to service with China and the West. There will also be pressure from the World Bank and America on the removal of the remaining fuel subsidy, caustic antagonism from different quarters for different reasons and how to fulfil the election IoUs which you gave to different power blocks, etc., etc.

Poverty and pains have no equilibrium, therefore, the situation can even get worse with the possibility of a cascading crisis within the first 100 days, as it happened in 1999 when OBJ took over and in 2011 with GEJ. Nonetheless, be strong, courageous, and audacious. Thou shall not complain, for thou waited, toiled and prayed for 30 years, now is your hour, seize the moment.

To fix Nigeria is like cooking stones for dinner, the water and the fire dry up quickly, yet the stones remain uncooked and squeezing water out of the stone becomes impracticable! The statistics is scary but true: 30% of the past ''Nigeria's chef'' expired suddenly or got violently killed on duty, another 30% were forcefully and unceremoniously disgraced out of the kitchen while the reaming 40% are still baffled (some incapacitated) till today asking ''what went wrong, how and why did I fail''. It is like a zero-sum game for Nigeria's chef. Worse still, the outgoing administration has used the last political ''LIFELINE''. The youths are tired of the Aso-Rock sermon of *dinner-not-ready, they want DINNER NOW*!

In all this, there is hope, transforming a complex country is not rocket science, it is doable. In recent world history, three outstanding leaders found themselves in similar situations and seized the moment, and against all odds, squeezed the water out of stones. However, the three didn't loot the treasury and didn't allow their associates to loot. Indeed, they killed their kleptomaniac associates. They practiced meritocracy. My favourite books in my library are Ben Gurion, the man who created Israel, The Story of Singapore by Lee Kuan Yew and Deng Xiaoping and The Transformation of China. Unarguably, Gurion, LKY and Deng were nothing short of miracle workers. Can we replicate what happened in China, Singapore and Israel in Nigeria? Yes.

*Pathway to Silver or Bronze Medals*

Smart nations are run the way Apple or Google run their businesses. There are five questions which smart transformative CEOs ask when trying to make an Elephant dance. Nigeria needs to ask those five questions as well. One, what is left on the table that Nigeria can grab quickly and use as a stepping stone, or make better- X+1?

Two, what is coming next on the horizon that we can enjoy the ""first-mover advantage""? Three, what capability as a nation do we have?

Four, what capabilities do we need?

Five, how do we get there from here? All smart nations (South Korea, India, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Israel, UAE, Sweden, Norway, Germany etc. without exception built their respective successes on those five pillars.

Indian elites took a bet on software as a business (the first India Institute of Technology- IIT, was established in 1951, in Kharagpur). Today, Indians in the diaspora remit over $100 billion yearly back home and most of the global technology companies are run by Indians. Taiwan bet on chip making and established the world's first semiconductor foundry, TSMC in 1987. Today, no Taiwan, no civilization! South Korea's economy runs on five legs: electronics, telecommunications, automobile manufacturing, shipbuilding and steel. Today, Samsung Electronics alone contributes about 17% to the GDP of South Korea, realizing $246 billion in 2022, i.e. more than five times Nigeria's yearly oil revenue. China zeroed in on building competence in the Global Supply Chain. Within 30 years, China went from zero to hero. Of the 100 countries I have studied in the last 10 years, the Thailand model fascinated me greatly. Thailand with about 70,000 villages, set up what is called ''ONE TOMBON, ONE PRODUCT'', with a beautiful slogan- 'Local Wisdom, Goes Global'. Each village (Tombon) has a product (based on their cultural and environmental competitive advantage) that they focus on and each village builds an ecosystem for backward and forward integration around it. Nigeria can start with the 774 local government councils: *One Council, One Product*- *OCOP*. For instance, the Benin people are the world's best of all time in Bronze making, we need to build a Bronze making industry ecosystem there in, for export. This can fetch over $1billon yearly income.

Answer: There are four major revolutions on going as I write: Electric Vehicles Revolution, (EVR), Space innovations, 4.0 skills, and Global Food crisis affecting 800 million hungry people worldwide. Those four problems constitute the new opportunities.

2 What's next?

Answer: Space commercialization, Defence innovations, Artificial intelligence solutions, Medical breakthrough in incurable diseases, Climate change solutions, currencies innovations.

3 What capabilities does Nigeria have: robust population of 220million with 52% youths, 40% arable land, a huge diaspora population, Dangote, and about 270 types of mineral and natural resources (only Chinese know the exact numbers, locations, and quantities and quality- I am not exaggerating!), Atlantic Ocean, Sambisa Forest, Lagos, AfCFTA, abundant sun and favorable climate, Diverse nationalities, untapped Africa market, etc.

4 What capabilities do we need?

Answer: rebirth, recalibration, elite consensus, re-industrialization, youth employment, infrastructural modernization, technology solutions to combat desert encroachment in the North and purposeful leadership, etc.

5 How do we get there from here?

Answer: Electrical vehicles are the future, by 2030, Europe will stop the production of vehicles using gasoline. By 2032, 75% of American vehicles will be EVs. Interestingly,Nigeria is one of the few countries in the world that has all the eight mineral resources required to build a complete ecosystem for EV manufacturing: Cobalt in Kano, Lithium, Nickel, Cooper, Graphite, Zinc, Manganese and Rare Earths. They are all available in Kaduna, Nasarawa, Kogi, Plateau, Benue, Borno, Adamawa, Kebbi, Cross Rivers Katsina and Ekiti.

There will be an unusual quantum leap in EVs businesses.

Nigeria should build a new ''renewable energy hub'' that will employ over a million youths within the next two years through private initiatives. The leading global battery supplier, CATL which controls 34% of the world's EV batteries should be invited to site its factory in Nigeria for the European market fulfilment. Nigeria is closer to Europe than China. And instead of the crude ways Chinese employ currently to steal some of there mineral resources that is the source of unending communal crisis in some part of Nigeria, let us sit down with the Chinese to stop the *Monkey Business* and let us do a clean and proper win- win EVs related businesses, going forward.

The global electric car market was valued at $229b in 2021 and is projected to reach $700 billion in 2030 growing at 17.30% yearly.

Another one million youths can be absorbed and become gainfully employed through innovative and customized JAPA INITIATIVES plus the New Business Process Outsourcing package (NBPO), using the instrumentality of 4.0 industrial revolutions solutions and skills. From NBPO, Nigeria can begin to earn up to $ 50 billion in inflows from June 2024 I.e. *delicious food is ready within 12 months* The Philippines is number two globally in BPO, and India is number one. Nigeria can be number three: *the youths are ready when the government is ready* There is no better sector to invest in the $800 million World Bank grant than NBPO (RoI is massive and fast, with no competition). Concomitantly, Nigeria would need to create two new banks: Nigeria Start-Ups Bank (NSB) and Nigeria Diaspora Bank (NDB). The existing banking solutions are not enough to harvest the emerging massive opportunities in the ongoing professional demographics shifts.

To fix another one million unemployed youths, the 800 million hungry population worldwide need food, food, and food. Using the latest precision agricultural technology, Nigeria's Middle Belt can feed half of the world's hungry people profitably, when and if the heads men killings stop.

We also need to get Dangote Refinery up and running since yesterday to conserve 70% of our dollars spent on fuel importation.

Even if the federal government has to take additional 20% equity (but transparently valued this time around), the risk is worth taking. The Dangote ecosystem would take about 500,000 Nigerians out of poverty including market women selling table water and nuts to the staff of the refinery. Dangote must work and walk, NOW!

All said Nigeria can fix 5 million youths in quality, high-paying jobs within the next 24 months, generate a fresh $50 billion revenue inflow from innovative programs aiming at assisting the naira gain a full erection and reflate the economy. Before the C-19 pandemic, one company in Taiwan had about 0ne million employees (5% of the population) on its payroll. Just one company! In 2022, Walmart had about 2.3 million employees and realized a revenue of $ 600 billion. Nigeria's environment should be made fertile for mega businesses to germinate and thrive, where the likes of Foxconn and Walmart would be replicated here

Africa has been anxiously waiting for the Elephant (Nigeria) in the room to arise and dance, likewise the entire black race. Nigeria cannot afford to continue to move in circles like the Barber's chair. Nations perish for lack of three things: knowledge, vision and political will. Everything is possible, including winning a GOLD, Silver, Bronz or CKD medals, depending on the choices we make today!

Going forward, let us reason, talk and choose wisely, for all we have is this tiny but fantastically blessed 923,768 sq. km piece of land in the Cosmos filled with milk and honey, sugar, chess and butter plus! Paradoxically, Nigerians scarcely cherish their own country. While globally, Nigerians are viewed pitiably, secretly, however, our land is the envy of all- no competition. None. Honest!

The Russia-Ukraine war however disrupted the chances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short term.

The war between these two countries has led to economic sanctions on multiple countries, a surge in commodity prices, and supply chain disruptions, causing inflation across goods and services and affecting many markets across the globe.

The oil and gas market is expected to grow to $8,670.91 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 4.3 per cent.

The oil and gas market consists of sales of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and asphalt, lubricating oil and grease.Values in this market are 'factory gate' values, that is the value of goods sold by the manufacturers or creators of the goods, whether to other entities (including downstream manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers) or directly to end customers.

The value of goods in this market includes related services sold by the creators of the goods.

Oil and Gas extraction is the exploration and production of petroleum and natural gas from wells.

Asia-Pacific was the largest region in the oil and gas market in 2022.North America was the second largest region in the oil and gas market.

The regions covered in the oil and gas market are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.

The main types are oil & gas upstream activities, oil downstream products.Oil and gas upstream activities include exploration activities, such as creating geological surveys and obtaining land rights and production activities, such as onshore and offshore drilling.

The various drilling types include offshore; onshore that are used for residential, commercial, institutions and other applications.

Low interest rates in most developed countries will positively impact the oil and gas industry during the forecast period.For instance, in March 2020, UK decreased the interest rates to 0,1 per cent which was the lowest ever.

Furthermore, other Central Banks of countries such as North Macedonia, South Africa, Malaysia, Kenya, Argentina, Ukraine, Sri Lanka, and Azerbaijan, as well as Turkey also decreased their interest rates in 2020.

Oil price volatility is likely to have a negative impact on the market as significant decline and increase in oil prices negatively impacts the government and consumer spending.

The decline in oil prices is having a negative impact on government spending in countries such as, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) which are largely dependent on revenues generated through crude oil exports; whereas significant increase in oil prices had resulted in rising inflation, current account deficit and fiscal deficit in countries such as; India and China, which predominantly import oil.

For instance, the Saudi government is expected to cut down its spending from 1.05 trillion riyals ($280 billion) in 2019 to 1.02 trillion riyals ($270 billion) in 2020, to 955 billion riyals ($255 billion) by 2022, due to significant decline in revenues generated from oil exports, thereby, affecting the market. This high volatility in oil prices is expected to negatively impact the market going forward.

Major companies in the oil and gas industry are looking into big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance decisions making abilities and thus drive profits.

Major companies in the oil and gas market include; Royal Dutch Shell, BP plc, Saudi Aramco, Exxon Mobil, Gazprom PAO, Chevron, Iraq Ministry of Oil, PJSC Lukoil, Total SA, and Rosneft.

The companies gather huge amounts of raw data relating to the working of refineries, pipelines and other infrastructure through a large number of sensors placed across the oil rig.

Using big data analytics, the companies can detect patterns which can allow them to quickly react to unwanted changes or potential defects, thus saving costs.AI allows the companies to take better drilling and operational decisions.

Companies such as ExxonMobil and Shell have been increasingly investing in AI technology to have a centralized method of data management and support data integration across multiple applications.

Other companies such as Sinopec, a Chinese chemical and petroleum corporation, has announced its decision to construct 10 intelligent centers to help in reducing operation costs by 20 per cent.

It even gets scarier when looking at Alex, a hyper-realistic robot who speaks, makes 600 human facial expressions and can be customized to look like anyone.

Report has it that Alex even has a girlfriend named Alexandra, a humanoid barista.

Alex is the brainchild of Promobot, a Russian company founded by three friends, Oleg Kivokurtsev, Maxim Utev, and Igor Yeremeev, who began building robots a decade ago by purchasing parts online.

Their first creation, Promobot V1, could speak and even recognize faces, but the founders wanted to create a more realistic-looking robot.

Fast forward to today, and Promobot has built over 1,000 robots operating in 50 countries worldwide.

However, creating humanoid robots like Alex is no easy feat, with the company having raised $8 million( N3.68 billion) to bring these innovative machines to life.

Alex boasts more than 600 servomotors in its face, body, and arms, and while the company has made impressive progress, they are not resting on their laurels.

A servomotor is an electric motor that is designed to provide precise control of movement or position.

Promobot also aspires to develop a robot that can walk, a challenging endeavor they are confident they can accomplish.

Meanwhile, in another report, a Nigerian made history by creating the first human-like robots in Nigeria and Africa

The robot named Omeife is expected to open up new research developments in Artificial Intelligence.

The robot, according to reports, can speak five Nigerian languages and respond to instructions.

The creator, Ekwueme also said Omeife pays attention to a specific person to keep the conversation alive and chooses its words carefully.","{'uri': 'legit.ng', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Legit.ng - Nigeria news.', 'description': 'Check out the latest Naija news and stay informed with Legit.ng.
