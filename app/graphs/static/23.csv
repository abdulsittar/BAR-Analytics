China's Foreign Ministry defended its ally Pakistan earlier this week after President Donald Trump said the United States could no longer be silent about militants using safe havens on Pakistani soil.

On Monday, Trump committed the United States to an open-ended conflict in Afghanistan, signaling he would send more troops to America's longest war and vowing ""a fight to win"".

He insisted that others - the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and NATO allies - step up their own commitment to resolving the 16-year conflict, but he saved his sharpest words for Pakistan.

Yang, who outranks China's foreign minister, told Tillerson on Wednesday that China was willing to coordinate with the United States on Afghanistan and make joint efforts to realize peace and stability there and in the region, according to a Chinese statement issued late that night.

""We must value Pakistan's important role on the Afghanistan issue, and respect Pakistan's sovereignty and reasonable security concerns,"" Yang told Tillerson.

Pakistan has been battling home-grown Islamists for years. It sees Afghanistan as a vital strategic interest and a bulwark against old rival, India. Islamabad denies harboring militants, who move across the porous border with Afghanistan.

China and Pakistan consider each other ""all-weather friends"" and have close diplomatic, economic and security ties.

Beijing has its own security concerns in the region, in particular any links between militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan and Islamist groups China blames for violence in its far western region of Xinjiang.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua in Beijing on Tuesday, according to a statement on Thursday. He praised Pakistan's efforts to combat extremism and to secure the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a development initiative central to President Xi Jinping's global Belt and Road development plan.

""Given the current complicated and changing international and regional situation, the strategic significance of China-Pakistan relations is even more prominent,"" Wang said.

KARACHI - The Pakistani military on Wednesday reacted strongly to US threats of aid cuts to pressure the country on counter-terrorism efforts, with army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa saying the war on terror would be conducted in line with national interests and not to ""appease anyone"".

Bajwa made the remarks during a meeting with US ambassador David Hale, who called on the army chief at the general headquarters in Rawalpindi to brief him about the new US policy for Afghanistan and South Asia.

""We are not looking for any material or financial assistance from USA but trust, understanding and acknowledgement of our contributions,"" Bajwa was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the military's media arm.

His remarks were an apparent response to secretary of state Rex Tillerson's comments on Tuesday that the US has some leverage, in terms of aid and Islamabad's status as a non-NATO alliance partner, to pressure Pakistan to do more to counter terrorism and help bring the Afghan Taliban to the negotiating table.

The statement quoted Bajwa as saying that ""peace in Afghanistan is as important for Pakistan as for any other country"". He added, ""We have done a lot towards that end and shall keep on doing our best, not to appease anyone but in line with our national interest and national policy.""

Bajwa also said ""collaboration and synergy of effort between all stakeholders is the key to success to bring this long drawn war in Afghanistan to its logical conclusion"".

Hale said the US ""values Pakistan's role in the war against terror and is seeking cooperation from Pakistan to resolve the Afghan issue"".

Earlier, Pakistan rejected Trump's criticism of the country for harbouring terrorists and said the Kashmir issue is the ""primary obstacle"" to peace and stability in the region.

While unveiling his new policy for Afghanistan on Monday, Trump signalled a toughening of the US position on Pakistan for sheltering terror groups. He also spoke of working more closely with India, which he called on to provide more economic aid to Afghanistan.

In a terse reaction to Trump's remarks, the Foreign Office advised the US to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism ""instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens"".

Foreign minister Khawaja Asif also rejected the US criticism, saying Pakistan should not be blamed for the failure of the US military.

""They should not make Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures in Afghanistan,"" Asif told Geo News channel. ""Our commitment to war against terrorism is unmatched and unshaken.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Javed_Bajwa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Qamar Javed Bajwa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hale_(diplomat)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'David Hale (diplomat)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rawalpindi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Rawalpindi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kashmir conflict'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_News', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Geo News'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}]",,eng-3382459,0.003921568627450966,241424400,1,thelinkpaper.ca,news,The Link News Paper,Qamar Javed Bajwa Pakistan Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan) Pakistan Army Counter-terrorism Afghanistan David Hale (diplomat) Rex Tillerson War on Terror Pakistan Armed Forces Taliban South Asia United States Secretary of State Islamabad Karachi Rawalpindi Kashmir conflict Terrorism India Geo News Khawaja Muhammad Asif Foreign and Commonwealth Office United States Armed Forces,Canada,CA,English,eng,,,C4,C2,North America,,Christian,13.0,18.0,14.0,12.0,10.0,13.0,13.0,15.0,32.0,13.0,32.0,17.0,20.0,39.0,80.0,52.0,48.0,36.0,68.0,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),NAFTA,North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),NATO,,,English-speaking,Eng,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,26,20,6,2017-08-26

Young Afghans struggle with their country's future,"This week, U.S. President Donald Trump committed more troops to his country's 16-year war in Afghanistan.

The speech, delivered Monday in Arlington, Virginia, in front of military personnel and his cabinet, was President Trump's first national security address to the nation on a policy issue.

He offered few details on the new Afghanistan strategy and suggested that the military plans would not be released, as a means to keep ""America's enemies"" in the dark.

Currently, the U.S. has two military operations underway in Afghanistan. Neither of those are combat roles. But, as Soraya Afzali tells Day 6 guest host Peter Armstrong, it doesn't matter if the U.S. plans to hunt terrorist cells or undertake nation-building, the real hope for her country lies with the new generation of young Afghans.

""I understand that living in Afghanistan is not easy. Every day is a struggle... but it's still an opportunity for anybody who stays in this country, because everything is untouched,"" Afzali says.

""From a business perspective or economic perspective, there are always a lot of things that need to be done. It just needs a strong-willed person to stay here and take on those tasks.""

Afzali is a 24-year-old social activist and part of Afghanistan's first wave of post-Taliban university graduates. She chose to study in Kabul despite earning a scholarship to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.

While many of her peers are fleeing, Afzali, who graduated last month, says she's digging in to build a better future.

""I don't think I'm missing anything. I am in my own country, I have a free will of working on anything. I can start a business at any time I want and really invest into my country,"" Afzali says.

More than 2.5 million people have fled Afghanistan as the country slips further and further into chaos. While the pace of economic and political reform in Afghanistan is slow, safety is the bigger issue.

This has been the deadliest year for Afghan soldiers protecting their country, and joint Taliban and ISIS attacks have killed more than 100 civilians this month alone.

Last August, 12 people were gunned down in an attack on the American University, including seven students.Afzali was among the 750 huddled on campus at the time.

Afzali was stuck in a classroom listening to the gunfire around her, and while she says the attack hurt her physically and mentally, she doesn't want to let go of that memory.

""If I am giving up, if I am going to another country because these things had been happening to me for so long, then who is in this country to rebuild and to change that?"" she asks.

Many of the students were just children when the Taliban regime collapsed. They've grown up with a higher standard of education and leadership that gives them hope of a better future.

""We have a young generation emerging, and that is our power and our answer to them,"" Afzali says in response to the attackers and political opponents.

""If I am giving up, if I am going to another country because these things had been happening to me for so long, then who is in this country to rebuild and to change that?""

But car bombs and gunmen aren't the only challenges facing this generation, especially young women.

""I am facing sexual harassment every day. Even if I am going and buying groceries, I have to fight for my right,"" Afzali says of the patriarchal bent of Afghan society.

Her defiance wouldn't have been tolerated 16 years ago, but today she accepts the restrictions as a challenge to work even harder to prove her mettle.

Afzali has lived life as both a refugee and a returnee to Afghanistan.

Her family fled Afghanistan for Iran when she was a baby, though she isn't sure exactly how old she was or the year they left. Both of her parents are illiterate, which is why they put a strong emphasis on education.

She attended school in Iran until grade five when her family was told the Iranian public school system would no longer be an option. That was around 2005, after the fall of the Taliban.

""I am putting so much into this and that is something precious.""

Afzali's father decided it was time to return to Afghanistan, where the rules had changed and girls were allowed to attend school. Plus, despite years of conflict, it was home.

That's how Afzali sees the country also. She sees key government posts being handed to young, inexperienced leaders rather than more well-established men, and she wants to be one of those leaders.

""I am putting so much into this and that is something precious,"" she says. ""That is something valuable for me.""

""If I'm not able stay through this and work in Afghanistan or study either internationally or nationally for Afghanistan, then ... if I have my daughter here, she will suffer the same thing I do,"" Afzali says. .

""So I am thinking on a much longer term rather than missing anything in some other countries.""","[{'uri': 'cbc_radio@cbc.ca', 'name': 'Cbc Radio', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'file_photo@cbc.ca', 'name': 'File Photo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'montreal_expos@cbc.ca', 'name': 'Montreal Expos', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'in_the_end@cbc.ca', 'name': 'In The End', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'his_cabinet@cbc.ca', 'name': 'His Cabinet', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'then_if@cbc.ca', 'name': 'Then If', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'am_giving_up@cbc.ca', 'name': 'Am Giving Up', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'a_soldier@cbc.ca', 'name': 'A Soldier', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'am_going@cbc.ca', 'name': 'Am Going', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'buying_groceries@cbc.ca', 'name': 'Buying Groceries', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'jonah_keri@cbc.ca', 'name': 'Jonah Keri', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'pardoning_sheriff_joe@cbc.ca', 'name': 'Pardoning Sheriff Joe', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'l_a_dodgers@cbc.ca', 'name': 'L.A.

History is littered with lost civilizations: the Khmer empire that created Angkor Wat, the Mayans who left behind a magnificent step pyramid at Chichen Itza, the Nabataeans who carved breathtaking Petra out of solid sandstone, the mysterious inhabitants of Eastern Island whose enormous enigmatic head monuments delight and puzzle.

To name just a few.

They abandoned their great cities and disappeared into the dust.

But they built things.

The Taliban have built nothing. Their claim to historical notoriety will be the wilful, pious destruction of precious shrines and statuary.

Their rabidly puritanical culture will collapse because it cannot stand in a world of modernity that has encroached even into the isolated crevices and defiles of Afghanistan. Cellphones and satellite dishes have brought the outside inside. Afghans understand what they do not have and what the Taliban aspire to take away. There is nowhere for forced ignorance to hide anymore.

This is the real long war the Taliban are destined to lose.

What they have in their favour, at this moment in time, is that Afghans, however much they may loathe the Taliban -- overwhelmingly they do, even in the Pashtun south -- they detest their endlessly corrupt and incompetent national government even more, a government that survives only with propping up by the West.

Oh, they've indeed embraced bureaucracy -- how Canada's then-Brig.-Gen. David Fraser, commanding officer, described the nation-building aspect of the mission to me in 2006 -- which is why hardly anything ever gets accomplished as ministry orders and security manifests pass through a multitude of hands, each generously greased, billions of dollars disappearing sideways. That too is Afghan culture, thieving, which is viewed as outwitting.

The vanishing money is a chronic and losing battle fought by donor nations.

The other long war -- 16 years and counting, a ""forever war"" that the sons and daughters of today's deployed solders may still be waging a generation from now -- can yet go either way. We don't even have any idea what ""winning"" would look like, as the mission keeps changing from White House administration to administration.

President George Bush, contrary to pillars of Republicanism, talked about nation-building after the Taliban had been trounced. That's what sold Canada's troop commitment (apart from special forces, in the unfussy business of killing) to the public; we were redeveloping, winning over hearts and minds. Except that's never a good fit for any military -- they're soldiers, not diplomats and not humanitarian aid providers.

But the profile played well to Canadians still in thrall to a Pearsonian peacekeeping ideal: useless when there's no peace for the blue berets to keep. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau embodies this anachronism.

It was Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said of Afghanistan in 2008, ""we can't kill our victory."" However seductive the proposition, that's never been the goal. Bombing the Taliban to the negotiation table has been the goal. With the insurgents -- more hardcore militant than ever, merging with the Pakistan-based Haqqani network (the Taliban No. 2, head of military operations, hails from Haqqani) -- making significant territorial gains, there's scarcely any reason to talk peace and reconciliation.

The Taliban have scuttled back to reclaim much of the territory vacated during the post 9/11 coalition military campaign. Crucially, however, they haven't been able to get a toehold in Kabul. Or Herat. Or Mazar-e Sharif.

In broad strokes, the situation is nevertheless grim. Sangin, the strategic town in Helmand that a hundred British troops died trying to defend during the International Security Assistance Force era, fell to the Taliban in March. Vast swaths of Kandahar province, where 137 Canadian combat deaths were recorded, are now controlled by the insurgents.

According to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, ""control or influence"" of the central government dropped to 65.6 per cent by May 1 from 70.5 per cent a year before. The Taliban ""controls, contests or influences"" 171 of 400 Afghan districts, mostly in rural areas and superficial in others. They've not been able to take and hold provincial capitals.

That's the big picture and the Taliban take immense sustenance from it, as if their ascendancy is written in the stars. Because Afghanistan is where empires go to die. Except the Taliban are no more indomitable than invading empires, though they certainly are accommodating to vilified fanatical revolutionaries from Al Qaeda to, in its death throes, Daesh.

So this is what the Taliban -- via spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid -- had to say about President Donald Trump's oratorical doubling down last week on U.S. recommitment to the wars in Afghanistan:

""Donald Trump is just wasting American soldiers. We know how to defend our country. It will not change anything. . . . For generations, we have fought this war. We are not scared. We will continue this war until our last breath. If the U.S. does not pull all its troops out of Afghanistan, we will make this country the 21st century graveyard for the American empire.""

The usual rhetoric, conveniently leaving out the part where the Taliban were routed from Afghanistan in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.

""For now,"" Mujahid continued, ""I can tell you there was nothing new in his speech. It was very unclear.""

On that point, at least, we are agreed.

The finest minds in the Pentagon have not been able to figure out how to take the Taliban off the board for keeps, in what has become America's longest war, though it would indisputably involve some kind of political reconciliation for the insurgents and right now they're hardline not-in-the-mood. Yet even a child's mind could grasp how foolishly -- in his palpable reluctance -- president Barack Obama waged the war during his two terms in the White House, even with his 2009 troop surge, virtually providing the Taliban with a timeline for troop reduction and eventual withdrawal.

In his speech last week, the otherwise incoherent and quite maddened Trump at least got this much right: ""I've said it many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin, or end, military operations. We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities. Conditions on the ground -- not arbitrary timetables -- will guide our strategy from now on. America's enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out. I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will.""

The thing is, it does not appear that the generals or the president have a clue about their plans either, beyond the 3,900 troops that will be added to the U.S. existing military presence of 8,500 U.S. service members, about half involved in training and mentoring Afghan defence forces and the other gunning for terrorists.

Trump claimed the American objective in Afghanistan was not nation-building, which comes as jaw-dropping news, given the billions spent on aid to do precisely that.

I don't know what ""principled realism"" means. I don't know what ""our commitment is not unlimited"" means. I don't know what ""we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live or how to govern their own complex society"" means, unless women are to be driven back into their cloistered homes, away from education, and beaten with a stick, as the Taliban did when they ruled Kabul.

""We are killing terrorists,"" Trump said.

Except kill a Taliban fighter and another will replace him, maybe five more.

""We want (Afghanistan) to succeed but we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. Those days are now over.""

Well, not in this America's image, as she has presented herself over the past eight months or so.

It is indeed a vague strategy, albeit better left in the hands of the generals than this irrational president.

There is one solid bottom line: Eventually, even if decades from now, the U.S. will leave Afghanistan, hopefully better than they found it.

But the Taliban or its descendants and derivatives can wait out even that multi-generational war: They live there.

It's Afghans who will ultimately have to conquer Afghans.

That's called civil war, which will draw in regional neighbours and non-regional (China, Russia) interests.
