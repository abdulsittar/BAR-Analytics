""Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country. Instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens, the US needs to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism,"" statement said.

While urging Washington to work with Islamabad against terrorism FO said that criticism by US President Donald Trump was ""disappointing"".

""The policy ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation"", it said.

""No country in the world has suffered more than Pakistan from the scourge of terrorism, often perpetrated from outside our borders. It is, therefore disappointing that the US policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation in this effort,"" statement said.

Trump dramatically criticized Pakistan during a much anticipated national address on Monday in which announced a new strategy on the United StatesÂ´ involvement in Afghanistan.

""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,"" Trump said.

""That will have to change and that will change immediately.""

Pakistan routinely dismisses US criticism, saying the country has never received credit for the tens of thousands of lives lost and billions spent battling insurgents.

In its latest statement, which came after an hours-long cabinet meeting, Islamabad insisted it was fully participating in global counter-terror efforts.

It is worth mentioning here that Pakistan has suffered much in war against terrorism and launched major military operations to dismantle the terrorists' hideouts and wipe out the terrorists from its territory.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cabinet (government)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}]",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2017-08-23/l_225270_024653_updates.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.3568627450980392,241136940,1,thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,"Donald Trump Terrorism Pakistan Islamabad Afghanistan Foreign and Commonwealth Office Washington, D.C.

The announcement by President Trump sparked sharp reaction both from government and civil society with politicians rejecting it out rightly.

There was serious concern that Pakistan role and contribution in tackling the menace of terrorism has not been acknowledged and rather arms twisting approach is being adopted.

The sources said that Pakistan has rendered matchless sacrifices for the peace and stability in Afghanistan while the effort of Pakistan have been totally neglected by the US.

There doesn't exist safe havens of terrorists in Pakistan, said Maj General Asif Ghafoor, Director General Inter Services Public Relations while reacting to US President Donald Trump's Afghan policy statement.

He said Pakistan Army conducted operation 'Raddul Fasaad' against all terrorists without any discrimination. ""An American delegation recently visited Pakistan and acknowledged the Pakistan's efforts to uproot terrorism.""

""For us Pakistan is important more than anything else. We also told American authorities that there doesn't exist any terrorists' network, including that of Haqqani's, in Pakistan,"" DG ISPR said while adding that foreign office will officially declare Pakistan's stance on Donlad Trump's Afghan policy.

Last week, a delegation of United States headed by Commander US Central Command (CENTCOM) General Joseph L. Votel visited North Waziristan Agency and lauded efforts and sacrifices of Pakistan Army and local tribes for re-establishing peace in the area, according to a statement of ISPR.

On the other side, the US Ambassador David Hale paid a courtesy call on the Foreign Minister Tuesday afternoon and briefed him about President Trump's latest statement on the US policy review on South Asia and Afghanistan.

According to Foreign Office Ambassador Hale conveyed that the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson looked forward to meeting the Foreign Minister in the next few days to have an in-depth discussion on the state of play in the bilateral relationship as well as the new US policy on South Asia.

The Foreign Minister stated that he had accepted the invitation when the Secretary of State called him on 14th August and looked forward to his early interactions in Washington, said the statement issued by MOFA. The Foreign Minister reiterated Pakistan's perspective and desire for peace and stability in Afghanistan. Highlighting Pakistan's immense sacrifices in the enduring fight against terrorism, the Foreign Minister underlined Pakistan's continued desire to work with the International Community to eliminate the menace of terrorism.

In response to US President Donald Trump's address this morning pertaining to the US strategy in Afghanistan, Imran Khan, and other politicians, in the country took to Twitter to express their views on the US president's harsh comments against Pakistan.

US president Donald Trump on Monday revealed the broad strokes of the new US foreign policy regarding Afghanistan. While asking Afghanistan, India and others to step up their game in the war on terror, President Trump saved harsh words for Pakistan. In his speech, he censured Pakistan for providing safe havens to ""agents of chaos, violence and terror"". Neglecting the sacrifices Pakistan has made in the war on terror while being plagued with the scourge of terrorism itself, the US President asked Pakistan to pull its weight and show its commitment to civilization, order and to peace.

Pakistan rejected the allegations made by the Donald Trump. The foreign office released a press statement condemning the accusations. Several politicians, journalists and the Pakistan army spoke against the disappointing remarks and criticized the US for making Pakistan a scapegoat in its failed war.

Reacting to US President Donald Trump's criticism of Pakistan during his speech on Tuesday, Pakistan ambassador to the United States Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry stressed that there were no safe havens for terrorists in Pakistan.

Earlier a statement had also been issued by Pakistan Foreign Ministry asserting Pakistan's commitment in the war on terror. It said, ""Pakistan has suffered more than any other country in the world from the plight of terrorism which has often perpetrated from outside our borders. Therefore, it is highly disappointing that the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation have been ignored in the US policy statement.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shireen_Mazari', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Shireen Mazari'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Drone strikes in Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Scapegoat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)'}}]",http://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2017-08-23/pakistan-military-should-dictate-red-lines-to-the-us-shireen-mazari-1503474194-1756.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.2627450980392156,241173480,1,nation.com.pk,news,The Nation,Shireen Mazari Pakistan Armed Forces Donald Trump United States Pakistan Drone strikes in Pakistan Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Foreign policy of the United States War on Terror United States Armed Forces Afghanistan Scapegoat Pakistan Army Terrorism India Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan),Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,23,38,8,2017-08-23

U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his policy for Afghanistan on Monday, committing to an open-ended conflict there and singling out Pakistan for harboring Afghan Taliban insurgents and other militants.

U.S. officials later warned that aid to Pakistan might be cut and Washington might downgrade nuclear-armed Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO ally to pressure it to do more to help bring about an end to America's longest-running war.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif added his voice to a chorus of indignation in Pakistan over the U.S. criticism, reiterating Pakistan's denial that it harbors militants.

""They should not make Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures in Afghanistan,"" Asif said in an interview to Geo TV late on Tuesday.

""Our commitment to war against terrorism is unmatched and unshaken.""

Pakistan has for years been battling militants who are seeking to overthrow the state with bomb attacks and assassinations.

Asif said Pakistan had suffered great losses from militancy - the government estimates there have been 70,000 casualties in militant attacks, including 17,000 Pakistanis killed - since Pakistan joined the U.S. ""war on terrorism"" after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

But he said Pakistan's efforts to fight terrorism were being taken for granted and dismissed the notion the United States could ""win war against terror by threatening us or cornering us"".

""Our contributions, sacrifices and our role as a coalition country have been disregarded and disrespected,"" Asif said.

The relationship between Pakistan and the United States has endured periods of extreme strain during the past decade, especially after al Qaeda militant leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. special forces in Pakistan in 2011.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is due to meet Asif in coming days, on Tuesday outlined a range of options to change Pakistan's approach but conceded there were concerns about putting too much pressure on Pakistan.

Asif said Pakistan was also angered by Trump's appeal to India to do more in Afghanistan.

""Attempting to isolate Pakistan will not yield anything but a dangerous sharpening of strategic fault lines,"" said Sherry Rehman, a senior opposition politician and former Pakistani ambassador to the United States.

Former cricket star turned opposition politician Imran Khan said Pakistan should finally learn a valuable lesson: ""Never to fight others wars for the lure of dollars,"" he said on Twitter. -- Reuters",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_non-NATO_ally', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Major non-NATO ally'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_TV', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Geo TV'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Assassination'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear weapon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Coalition government'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Special forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Osama bin Laden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Imran Khan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Reuters'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}]",http://aaj.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1115.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.6941176470588235,241191600,1,aaj.tv,news,AAJ.TV,"Khawaja Muhammad Asif United States Pakistan Afghanistan War on Terror Terrorism Karachi Major non-NATO ally Geo TV Donald Trump Taliban Assassination Insurgency Nuclear weapon United States Armed Forces Washington, D.C.

Speaking at a press conference, he urged Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi to give a strong reaction to the US president who threatened to cut Pakistan's aids.

Imran Khan said US aid was nothing compared to the losses Pakistan suffered while waging a war for US.

He said he had opposed the Pakistan's decision to join the US war after the 9/11 attacks. ""Pakistan took part in the war despite no Pakistani was involved in 9/11 attacks,"" he said.

""Pakistan had no reason to take part in that war. It was not our wars. We sent our army to Waziristan at the behest of US . He said 70,000 of Pakistanis were killed and many other injured in the war .

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan has called for a special parliamentary session to discuss US President Donald Trump's remarks that Pakistan was ""harbouring agents of chaos, violence, and terror"".

""We need to come together and send a message to the US that it can't pin the blame for its own failures on Pakistan,"" the PTI chief told reporters on Wednesday.

""The government, the military and the nation are all united against the US' allegations,"" he added.

Khan pointed out that both the PM and the foreign minister had not responded to Trump's statement.

""The PM should send a strong message to the US,"" he added.

Khan said the US had completely ignored the sacrifices rendered by the Pakistan Army in the war against terrorism and appeared to be appeasing India.

""Pakistan has made far more sacrifices than what the Americans have given it in financial assistance,"" he remarked.

""Instead of giving Pakistan credit for its efforts, the US is applauding India.""

The PTI chief said terrorism in Pakistan originated across the border in Afghanistan.

A day earlier, Trump had announced his long-awaited South Asia policy, calling for greater troop deployment and Indian involvement in Afghanistan. In his speech, the US president had also lambasted Pakistan for offering safe havens to ""agents of chaos"".

Addressing the press on Wednesday, Imran spoke about various elements of Washington's new policy.

""Grave allegations have been made against Pakistan,"" Khan said, referring to accusations made by Trump.

Khan said that the allegations signalled that Trump has ""no understanding of the South Asian region or the dynamics of the 'war on terror'"" as he pointed out the sacrifices Pakistan has made in the fight.

The PTI chairman further questioned the role allotted to India in Afghanistan in the policy.

He said that while Pakistan has made sacrifices and fought a war ""that is not ours,"" India has been asked to become involved even though it does not share a border with Afghanistan.

""Pakistan got involved in the [war] even though not a single Pakistani was involved in 9/11. Al Qaeda was in Afghanistan. It was not necessary for [Pakistan] to get involved in this war [as it was] not at fault,"" Khan said.

The PTI chief further questioned why Pakistan was being held responsible for America's policy failures in Afghanistan.

""Over 150, 000 Nato soldiers were deployed in Afghanistan [by America], billions were spent, thousands of Afghans were killed. The world's most powerful military machinery could not control [the situation in Afghanistan] and Pakistan is being held responsible for the failures,"" Khan said.

He asked what America would accomplish by deploying thousands more troops in Afghanistan when those already stationed there had not been able to win the war.

Khan also referred to Trump's statement that ""billions and billions"" of dollars have been spent on Pakistan.

He said that the amount spent by Washington on Pakistan is minuscule in comparison to the losses Pakistan has suffered in the war against terror.

Khan also criticised Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and the Foreign Office for not putting out a strong statement in response to Trump's ""serious"" allegations against the country.

""There has been no statement from the prime minister or the Foreign Office. Instead, China has come to Pakistan's defence and issued a statement,"" Khan said, calling on Abbasi to ""send a strong message to the Americans"".

The Foreign Office had, in fact, put out a statement Tuesday night.

Khan also called on Pakistan's civilian and military leadership to send a unanimous message to Washington that Trump's statements are ""unacceptable"".

The PTI chief further called for the holding of a special parliament session so that a consensus may be developed by the country's leadership on the matter.

He said that his party has filed an adjournment motion in the National Assembly for this purpose.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Imran Khan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'National Assembly of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Parliament'}}]",http://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/08/599d82a45002c.png,eng-3382459,-0.207843137254902,241194600,1,dawn.com,news,Dawn,Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Imran Khan Donald Trump South Asia Pakistan India Afghanistan War on Terror Al-Qaeda Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Foreign and Commonwealth Office NATO China National Assembly of Pakistan Parliament,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,23,30,14,2017-08-23

Terming the Trump's statement as disappointing, Dastagir said that the US president, who dramatically criticised Pakistan during a much anticipated national address on Monday, had ignored the unmatched sacrifices Islamabad had rendered against terrorism.

He asked the US president to extend support to Pakistan in eliminating terrorism instead of talking about the 'save heavens in Islamabad'.

Earlier on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump had warned Pakistan for providing ""safe havens to agents of chaos and terror"".

It is as expected. The increased US troops that have been welcomed by Kabul are only going to exacerbate the conflict and give the insurgents an impetus to continue on a war footing.

As anticipated, India was asked to contribute more to the country. After all, Modi and Trump's ideological and world viewpoints converge dangerously close to each other. Giving a carte blanche to India to extend its role in Afghanistan is - as pronounced by Pakistan's retiring High Commissioner to India, Abdul Basit - nothing but ""a recipe for disaster"".

Washington, instead of using this opportunity to reprimand India for its insidious role in Afghanistan vis-Ã -vis Pakistan, has overlooked the evidence painstakingly conveyed to the Pentagon and the US State Department over the years by Islamabad. It has instead chosen to make its bed with a state whose continued use of military force and deplorable human rights record in Kashmir can only earn it the accolade of state terrorism.

But 'state terrorism' is the sword of Damocles hung over Pakistan as a last measure. We, the sponsors of terrorism, shall be labelled as such if we do not do what is being demanded: pull back all support from the Haqqani Network and destroy their safe havens.

Let us view this hypothetically: what if trouble persists in Afghanistan even after our military flushes out every Haqqani man, woman and child from the crevices of the hinterlands, which is most likely? Will Kabul and Washington still point their fingers at some other faction and demand Pakistan stop supporting it?

America's expedient use of friends and foes is nothing new. We, in Pakistan, have been privy to it for decades and lament it periodically and unabatedly. Yet, we continue to plough on, nurturing our relationship with Washington through the lows and the highs. But this is realpolitik. Though we may have compromised our integrity and national pride at some low points in the past decades, we are a sovereign nation. Do we need these reminders? Yes - and often.

As for the US, it is ready to overlook the human cost we paid in the loss of thousands of our soldiers fighting the war on terror for those 'billions and billions of dollars' given to Pakistan. The US wants Pakistan to get serious about clearing the safe havens for all those resisting the government in Kabul and the presence of the foreign forces. But not a word is mentioned about the safe havens operating on the other side of the Durand Line that house the TTP terrorists who use these as bases to launch attacks on Pakistan.

Asking India to extend its 'political' and economic role in India is nothing short of asking New Delhi to damage Kabul's already frayed relations with Islamabad. Not to mention its use of the so-called consulates for destabilisation purposes in Balochistan. Kabul's ire with Pakistan, stemming in large part from its own inability to bring dissident factions to an agreement, has further deteriorated relations between the two neighbours.

This is extremely unfortunate, given Pakistan's open-door policy for millions of Afghan refugees during the previous troubled decades. Instead of being discussed and redressed behind closed doors, any grievances are always publicised and exaggerated. Despite all parties agreeing to end the blame game and working closely to alleviate suspicions regarding alleged intelligence operations, the situation remains tenuous.

But first, we need to question our policy towards the US at this very critical juncture. Our relations with our western neighbours, including Iran, are at a low point. Our military and foreign policy - instead of evolving with changing geopolitical dynamics - remains stymied. The turning point in our approach to militancy and ending any alleged support to militant groups had come a while back. Let's not forget the horror of the massacre of the Army Public School in Peshawar in December 2014 and the reaction that bound the nation together.

However, the lack of unity on the political front and the formulation of a clear and concise policy that has an inherent flexibility to accommodate any developments that threaten our national interests - and not just in the short term - has been our bane. If Pakistan could survive the damage of the past decades and prove its resilience, can it not coalesce together at this point and bridge the faultlines that threaten its own survival? If our policy is to change, it must be for the sake of our own people and not because of external threats.

Pakistan's help in bringing long-lasting stability to Afghanistan cannot be overlooked. Instead of working together towards an inclusive approach that brings Afghan insurgents to the negotiating table, Kabul and Washington - no doubt out of frustration - have chosen to go back full circle and opt for more boots on the ground. The onus will be on Nato to share the financial and human costs, as Trump has already laid out in his recent speech. And with India thrown in, it is bound to be an even greater morass. It is hoped that our civilian and military leadership put aside their 'other' preoccupations at present and formulate a cohesive strategy in response.

Trump accused Pakistan of nurturing safe havens for terrorists and allowing them space to operate successfully which eventually disrupts the peace process envisioned in Afghanistan by America. In an attempt to present himself as more of a serious and astute politician, Trump put forward his future strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia. The US president delivered exactly what the US media and war mongers in the country wanted.

Tump clearly parted ways with his campaign promise of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. After the swift departure of Steve Bannon - Trump's chief strategist, this was a major step taken away from the policy devised by Bannon and Trump. It was evident from scathing response by the far-right news agency Brietbart which accused the president of becoming a puppet of generals, after sanctioning more troops to counter the Taliban, ISIS and Al Qaida in Afghanistan.

Continuously marred by controversies and deemed unfit to rule America, Trump has been caught in a catch-22 situation. On one side, he has his populist support base which will not be pleased with this shift in strategy as it contradicted the campaign pledge on reducing the role of US military interventions abroad. Far-right will want answers as he was elected on populist rhetoric which rejected the stance of Obama administration on military adventures which were deemed unwinnable. While on the flip-side, Trump has to fight the ever-plunging support among the status-quo, amid the inquiry in to alleged role of Russians in facilitating his election campaign. Fearing the looming crises, ongoing fiasco and humiliation in White House, this opportunity presented him with a way to boost his credentials.

Trump has certainly ceased this opportunity, if one assesses the media's favourable reaction. Him aligning closely with India and presenting the case for India's future role in development of Afghanistan and lambasting Pakistan for doing so little (in dismantling the terrorist networks) points clearly towards his government's inability to offer anything new as he repeated the rhetoric of his predecessors. Ironically, he stated his ""strategy will change dramatically"" but analysis of his speech depicts that he had nothing new to offer. This is simply a continuation of the older policy. Following the footsteps of his predecessors; Bush and Obama, he wanted to give an impression of change depicting a major shift in the policy but in fact it was the same old story of 'do more', 'threat of vacuum in case of hasty withdrawal' and 'seeking an honourable exit' to honour the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives'. Change was simply an illusion created to dodge voters.

In reaction to Trump's speech, Pakistan's Ambassador to United States Aizaz Ahmad has reaffirmed Pakistan's stance that, 'there are no safe havens for terrorists in Pakistan'. He also regretted the US failure to acknowledge the huge sacrifices of Pakistan in the war on terror. Similar statement was also issued by the country's Foreign Office which also reasserted Pakistan's continuous efforts in combating terrorism.

Though, Foreign Office was late to respond on the matter. However, China was quick to put the record straight by backing Pakistan's efforts in fighting terrorism as a front line state. But, why did China respond promptly to rebut Trumps offensive against Pakistan? Did Trump reprimanded Pakistan or indirectly it was China?

China has huge stakes in Pakistan's sovereignty and its functioning as a safe country which could facilitate its dream of creating a new Silk Road. China's economy is on track to overtake US economy in the next decade. The Sub-continent and Afghanistan always had a pivotal importance in the global history. Even today, Pakistan is instrumental in linking east with west through its geographical location. New Silk Road of China (in the making) is to offer further prosperity to already growing China and all the countries linked on its way to Europe. With prospects of new markets opening, prompting close cooperation between Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, economic hurdles for America will increase.Therefore, US disapproves this new dawn as it will prove the lifeblood for the connected countries especially Russia.

For example, this new route will potentially bring cheaper and plentiful energy via a new pipeline having a capacity of 950 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through Central Asia, Turkey from Russia Similarly, investment in railways will increase the containers transported through train from 7,500 in 2012 to 7.5 million by 2020. China is willing to connect Paris, Berlin, Balkans, Moscow, central Asian countries linking Iran with Pakistan. This will pave way for minerals, energy sources and will connect the oceans with cities and will boost the volume of trade sharply which will tilt the tides in favor of China.

Why would America want China to have access to resources to fulfill its economic needs in the future? Any disruptions in the Silk Road plans could undermine China's economic supremacy. And America would never want China to succeed in its ambitious plans.

Trump cannot be termed as shrewd or astute politician. He is too naÃ¯ve for a politician. Steve Bannon was right when he said Trump looks more like a puppet of generals in the White House. Briefings by generals has certainly transformed his opinion, no wonder he said in his speech, 'all my life I heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office'. Well, you heard right Mr President because it is the status quo which runs America not presidents like you. By continuing the failed strategy and paradigm of the last 16 years, Trump has in fact renewed his war against peace in Pakistan and China's prospects to build a New Silk Road.","[{'uri':

It has been conveyed to the US administration through diplomatic channels that Pakistan will set its strategy for a peaceful Afghanistan in view of its national security policy, sources told Daily Express.

The civil and military leadership has expressed serious reservations over the new US policy on Afghanistan.

""Consultations at the highest levels concluded that Pakistan will not give in to any American pressure or demands,"" sources said, adding that senior federal authorities have voiced their reservations.

US seeks Pakistan's help to bring peace in Afghanistan, envoy tells COAS

It has been conveyed to the Trump administration that Pakistan has achieved 100% results in its military operations against terrorists of all hue and colour and will continue doing so until the last terrorist is eliminated.

According to sources, Pakistan has told US Ambassador David Hale that neither was Islamabad dependent on Washington for its defence system nor did its economy need American financial assistance.

They said that Pakistan had started approaching its allies, including China, Russia and other countries to muster support in the face of the new US policy. Beijing has assured Islamabad that it will veto any possible resolution in the UN Security Council by the US.

Sources also said that Islamabad has set its own strategy to deal with the new US strategy. Pakistan, they said, has warned the US of possible pull-out from the Afghan reconciliation process if Washington didn't change its approach.

Imran calls for special parliamentary session on Trump's remarks

""If the US adopts a balanced policy, Pakistan will also establish good relations with the Trump administration, otherwise Pakistan can review its relations on all issues,"" they added.

According to an important source, the US administration has started discussions on the policy in light of Pakistan's reaction.

Foreign Minister Khawja Asif's visit to the US will be vital in the context as the minister has been tasked to state Pakistan's stance to the Trump administration.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had earlier this month invited Asif to Washington. The invitation was extended by the secretary of state during a telephone conversation with Asif.

Trump once again bomb shelled Pakistan over false allegations of sheltering ""agents of chaos"". Trump's high-handed attitude towards Pakistan, ignores the sacrifices and loss borne by Pakistan and Pakistanis alike.It also reiterates two things. Firstly, that the US like ever is attacking Pakistan verbally by reiterating its policy of ""do more"". Secondly, Trump is promoting India's interest in the region. Trump's pro-India and anti-Pakistan policy surfaced even before he was elected as President.

Trump's skewed statementsare fueling more anger and nurturing anti-US slogans in Pakistan, rather than resolving the core issues faced by Pakistan for more than a decade. Pakistan itself has been the biggest prey to terrorists which began when it embroiled itself in a war against terrorism after the attack on the twin towers on 9/11. Pakistan, then the frontline ally of America in the war against terrorism became a victim in the war it was fighting.

The cost endured by Pakistan through the war on terror is incalculable. Many of the uncontrolled suicide attacks and terrorist activities have been harnessed to a large extent. The whole nation is fighting this war with courage and unified strength and will continue its efforts in the global war against terrorism.

It appears that the US has lost its battle and it has failed badly in restoring peace and stability in Afghanistan. Instead of holding its own army and failed policies accountable, it is blaming Pakistan. The inconclusive war in Afghanistan for the last 16 years has put America to shame. Moreover, the economic loss and killing of thousands of US troops in Afghanistan is not easy to justify at home.

Besides, justifying a 16-year long war in Afghanistan, Trump is paving the way for the deployment of more troops in Afghanistan and encouraging India's involvement in Afghanistan - calling India ""the largest democracy"" and a ""key security partner of the US"". Trump has marked the presence of India in Afghanistan as both legal and imperative.

Pakistan is firm in its stand of peaceful resolution of all conflicts and committed to work with the international community to achieve the common goal to overthrow extremism till its end

Trump's aggressive policy towards Pakistan might be seen as an effort to change the balance of power in South Asia giving importance to India over Pakistan and other regional countries like China, Iran and Russia.

In a way, it's an attempt to downplay the role of Pakistan and other regional countries. It would not be wrong to term Trump's statement a repetition of old rhetoric of ""do more"" and pro-India policy as anti-CPEC policy.

India seems busy in its utmost efforts to disturb the mega investment plan between China and Pakistan. Doubting the anti-CPEC element in Trump's rough and tough talk, China's Foreign Office blatantly rejected Trump's accusation for Pakistan safeguarding the houses of terrorists. China urged the world to recognize the role of Pakistan in war against terrorism.

By putting all blame on Pakistan and advocating the role of India in Afghanistan shows Trump's irresponsible attitude in terms of Indo-Pak hostile relations. Instead of convening the role of a mediator in resolving the Kashmir issue, Trump is adding fuel to the fire. India and Pakistan both are nuclear states. Though they do not owe the same status to the world as USSR and US had during Cold War era, the presence of the atomic bomb has made their position more sensitive and any irresponsible attitude can trigger a world-wide nuclear conflict.

In a nutshell, the US needs to review its policy in South Asia promoting peace and stability. Festering conflicts is not in anyone's interest. It's no longer pre-Westphalia era when there was no international system. Pakistan is an independent and sovereign state and hegemonic Indian designs cannot materialize since Pakistan is a nuclear state. Pakistan is firm in its stand of peaceful resolution of all conflicts and committed to work with the international community to achieve the common goal to overthrow extremism till its end.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'World war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Suicide attack'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kashmir conflict'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Democracy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear warfare'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cold War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Soviet Union'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Hegemony'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear weapon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International relations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereign state'}}]",http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/9d5d8700ba959afdfe99bde5669b712e.JPG ,eng-3382459,-0.3803921568627451,241228500,1,dailytimes.com.pk,news,Daily Times,War on Terror Terrorism Pakistan India Afghanistan South Asia World war Suicide attack China Kashmir conflict Foreign and Commonwealth Office International community Democracy Russia Iran Nuclear warfare Cold War Soviet Union Hegemony Nuclear weapon International relations Sovereign state,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,23,55,23,2017-08-23

Trump's outbursts certainly reflected poorly on the performance of those responsible for managing Pakistan's diplomacy.

But we were lucky that at least one of our neighbours rushed to our defence. Chinese foreign minister gave a statement to the effect that Pakistan was on the frontline in the war against terror.

China's defence of Pakistan will surely bring the two countries closer. And Trump administration may not have known that by lashing out at Pakistan, it has made a strategic mistake of providing an opportunity to Pakistan and China to come closer for diplomatic cooperation.

The American demand to 'do more' is not new for Pakistan, as the previous US governments had also been telling the country to expand anti-terror operations and end discriminating militant groups. But Pakistan's role in the entire regional game has undergone a significant shift in the past few years. The military now claims to be carrying out an across the board action against terrorists without any discrimination whatsoever. After the recent statement, it appears that the new US administration is not ready to acknowledge this shift in Pakistan's policy, which other regional stakeholders have also appreciated.

What is new is that the world is now speaking up about the country's sacrifices in terms of lives lost during all these years in the war against terrorism. Singling Pakistan out would mean the enhancement of Sino-Pak regional cooperation to an international-level collaboration between the two countries. It might not bode well for regional stability because China's relations with India are worsening and in return for the diplomatic help, the Chinese might at some point ask us to support them against India. In the current situation when Pakistan is facing multiple challenges at home, it won't be smart to get involved in conflicts that we have nothing to do with.

While Pakistan should be grateful China for the support, the country should also reform its foreign policy and reflect as to why we continue to face diplomatic failures. Why was it that another country had to do what is supposed to be the job of our representatives? *",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomacy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Discrimination'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}]",http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/b714acfb341d414acc83c9467242bdb5.jpg ,eng-3382459,0.1137254901960785,241229220,1,dailytimes.com.pk,news,Daily Times,Pakistan China Donald Trump Presidency of Donald Trump War on Terror Diplomacy Discrimination Federal government of the United States Terrorism India Foreign policy,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,7,0,2017-08-24

President Donald Trump's recent statement on Pakistan depicts the huge failure and deep flaws in the US policy towards Afghanistan since 9/11. America has gained nothing out of cash spending and taking body bags of its soldiers buried with anguish and pain in American graveyards. According to one estimate, as of October 18th, 2016, there have been 2,386 US military deaths in the war in Afghanistan.

War causalities continue after Trump assumed the Presidency. He is upset. He did not start the war but inherited from previous Republican and Democrat administrations. There is no debate and difference between these administrations dealing with Afghanistan. These administrations remained itchy with Pakistan as they perceived that the country is not proliferation American interests inside Afghanistan to win its war. How can Pakistan assist Americans to win a war inside Afghanistan?

But they have a perpetual faith in their policy that Pakistan is responsible for their failure inside Afghanistan. There is no end to the American blame-games on Pakistan. Sometimes they were Al-Qaeda groups, the Taliban terrorists, and the Haqqani Network operators. American blame-game did not move an inch away from the Haqqani Network in many years.

Pakistani government categorically refuses to have any Haqqani Network operated inside Pakistan's territory. The internal security situation inside Pakistan has improved considerably in the past four years, indicating ruthless military operation against all terrorist groups.

The United States has failed to achieve the same results inside Afghanistan and finds it convenient to throw the failure of its policy on Pakistan.

Trump is actually demonstrating American frustration while comparing the situation with neighboring Pakistan. America possesses sophisticated intelligence technology and from inside Afghanistan it can easily apprehend if Pakistan is breeding terrorist groups on its border areas with Afghanistan. America could bring the same to the Congress and the UN Security Council for action but the fact remains that the whole episode is American failure inside Afghanistan.

Trump is confused whether to leave Afghanistan or to bring more troops and money into the war-ravaged country - the same old useless exercises. The number of troops does not matter. It is the policy that matters. He wants to find a way out and the convenient one is to blame Pakistan.

Pakistan needs to be extra vigilant of Trump's frustration. His policy might affect the ongoing military policy in collaboration with the civilian administration. His Afghan fall out should not fall on Pakistan. Pakistan Foreign Office and GHQ readily and effectively respond to his statement and possible repercussions on Pakistan's security.

If security deteriorates in Pakistan in coming days and months, the Donald Trump administration must be held responsible. In another befitting response, Pakistan should not accept any military aid from the Pentagon now onwards.

The United States also must learn and understand that in the past sixteen years it has been supporting a particular faction of Afghan society, which is the main reason for its failure.

Trump wants to find a way out and the convenient one is to blame Pakistan

Why does not it change its policy and embrace all Afghan groups instead of Ghani, Abdullah, and Karzai? They could not bring peace in Afghanistan. Pakistan is not in that policy. Americans need to assemble their failure instead of blaming Pakistan.

Pakistan is a fast emerging 'as the 'tiger economy'. The country is no longer living on the American aid like the 1980s and 1990s. Even the syndrome of the 9/11 has been fainted away from its soil.

America needs to reset its relations with Pakistan. The old relationship and logic would no longer determine its ties with Pakistan. The vitality of Pakistan strength has risen higher day by day in South Asia, Central Asia, Middle East, and China.

Kabul is no longer a headache for Islamabad. It is an irritant for Washington and the Trump administration can act on Afghanistan freely and independently without consulting or fearing any threat from Islamabad. Pakistan is engaged on its democratic path and building infrastructure with China.

""They have their looted billions of dollars abroad and that is why they are afraid of responding to the US president's speech,"" he said while talking to media persons here. Imran came hard on Trump and said he had no understanding of Afghanistan and the region. He pointed out that no Afghan was involved in the 9/11 attacks in the United States and that there was no terrorist outfit in Pakistan at that time. He emphasised that Pakistan participated in this war at the behest of the US, adding that ""it wasn't our war"".

Imran noted that Trump was using the same rhetoric against Pakistan as was used by India and regretted that the government didn't defend Pakistan's case. He contended that neither the prime minister nor the foreign minister issued a statement in response to Trump's speech and acknowledged that China came to Islamabad's defence.

Instead of acknowledging Pakistan's sacrifices, he lamented, the US was hurling threats and this was because of failure of our foreign policy. ""A unanimous message should be conveyed that civilian and military leadership in the country are on the same page; a joint session of parliament should also be summoned over the US threat,"" he emphasised. He said instead of defending Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi should push for a joint sitting of parliament to thrash out Pakistan's foreign policy.

Imran said the US had made India a stakeholder in Afghanistan and urged the prime minister to convey a strong message to Washington in this connection. He added that New Delhi was using the Afghan soil to carry out terrorist acts in Pakistan.

Imran pointed out that India had been given a new role in Afghanistan and that Donald Trump had no understanding of the region. ""Trump has no idea as to who is the real terrorist and what are the issues (in Afghanistan),"" he claimed. ""I still say it even today that we should not have participated in this war,"" he added.

Imran said that Israeli and Indian lobbies were active throughout the world against Pakistan's nuclear programme and Trump's statement was also part of all this. The PTI chief said that while Pakistan has rendered sacrifices and fought a war ""that is not ours,"" India has been asked to get involved even though it does not share a border with Afghanistan.

""Pakistan got involved in the (war) even though not a single Pakistani was involved in 9/11. Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan. It was not necessary for (Pakistan) to get involved in this war, being not at fault,"" Imran said.

Imran again questioned why Pakistan was being held responsible for America's policy failures in Afghanistan. ""Over 150, 000 Nato soldiers were deployed in Afghanistan, billions were spent, thousands of Afghans were killed. The world's most powerful military machinery could not control (the situation in Afghanistan) and Pakistan is being held responsible for these failures,"" he regretted.

He wondered what America would accomplish by deploying thousands more troops in Afghanistan when those already stationed there had not been able to win the war. Imran referred to Trump's statement that ""billions and billions"" of dollars had been spent on Pakistan. He said that the amount spent by Washington on Pakistan was minuscule in comparison to the losses Pakistan had suffered in the war against terror.

Imran said the PTI had filed an adjournment motion in the National Assembly for discussion on Trump's speech.","[{'uri': 'mamumtaz_alvi@thenews.com.pk', 'name': 'MAMumtaz Alvi', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Imran Khan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Prime minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nawaz Sharif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Parliament'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'New Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'New Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Israel'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'National Assembly of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}]",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2017-08-24/l_225640_044747_print.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.4117647058823529,241230300,1,thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan) Imran Khan Donald Trump Pakistan India Afghanistan Prime minister Terrorism Islamabad Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Nawaz Sharif Parliament Foreign policy Foreign minister China NATO Al-Qaeda Washington, D.C.

Some senators also stressed giving supremacy to the parliament and the civilian government in foreign policy matters.

The lawmakers also called for summoning the joint sitting of the parliament to review the foreign policy after the Trump's statement and condemned the government for its slow response over the matter.

Amid heated debate in the Upper House on the US president's new plan for South Asia and Afghanistan and his appeal for India's help on Afghanistan, Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani in strong-worded remarks said, ""If Trump wants Pakistan to become graveyard of the US forces, let him do so.""

As Rabbani got endorsement from the senators by thumping of desks, he further said that Trump must realise that Pakistan belonged to the ""legacy of Vietnam and Cambodia.""

He also called Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif to cancel his visit to the US as this would covey a strong message.

Rabbani said that the government should stop the US embassy from the expansion work currently being undertaken in the diplomatic enclave.

Soon after, the Defence Minister Khurram Dastagir Khan gave the policy statement on the Trump's speech.

Some criticism came from some lawmakers over Wednesday's meeting of Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa with the US ambassador David Hale.

Some condemned the ambassador for meeting with the COAS, while by-passing the civilian government, and others criticised the ruling PML-N for its slow response over the Trump statement what they said prompted the COAS to give a statement in the meeting.

The legislators deplored that a recent US military delegation did not bother to seek a meeting with the parliamentarians.

They condemned the policy statement given by the defence minister, saying it was the same as earlier given by the foreign office.

The lawmakers unanimously said that the US was blaming Pakistan for the colossal failures of its policies in Afghanistan during the last 16 years.

Some advised the government to strengthen its relations with China and Russia in the wake of souring relations with the US.

Senate chairman also formed a sub-committee comprising six senators including Sherry Rehman and Mushahid Hussain Syed that would finalise policy guidelines, to be sent to the government, on the regional situation Pakistan is facing.

The sub-committee would present its report within four days to the Senate Committee of the Whole on Regional Challenges.

Former Pakistan's ambassador to US Sherry Rehman criticised the policy statement of the defence minister for having nothing new in it.

""It is deplorable that Pakistan issued the condemnation statement after China,"" she said.

Rehman said that the civilian government should have said that it did not need US aid rather the COAS had to say this in his meeting with the US ambassador.

""We would also have to look inward but US should also,"" she said.

PML-F Senator Muzaffar Hussain Shah said that Indian perception of South Asia seemed to gain ground in US foreign policy.

He said that Pakistan had been an ally of the US and had suffered most in this war on terror but there was no realisation from the US.

Shah called for reviewing the foreign policy of the country.

He said that joint sitting of the parliament should be summoned as they should show to the world that parliament gives the foreign policy of the country.

PML-N Senator General (retd) Abdul Qayyum said that the US' move to encourage India in Afghanistan would further complicate the problem.

The US wants to put blame of its defeat on Pakistan, he added.

""US policy pertaining to South Asia without mentioning a word about the thorny issue of Kashmir where worst human rights violations are being committed is incomprehensible,"" the PML-N senator said.

Sending more troops to Afghanistan would tantamount to reinforcing failure of the US, he added.

PML-N Senator Nehal Hashmi questioned in what capacity the US ambassador called on the COAS after by-passing the civilian government.

""This is insult to the democracy and the parliament and the US ambassador should apologise,"" Hashmi said.

He also said that the US embassy in Pakistan should not be made a spying station.

PPP Senator Farhatullah Babar was of the view that President Trump was wrong in pointing fingers at Pakistan but while rejecting the US president arrogance, Pakistan must also look inwardly whether time had not come for abandoning the failed policy of selective treatment of militant groups.

""Point seven of the National Action Plan (NAP) says that defunct outfits will not be allowed to operate under other new names but it has not been acted upon,"" he said, adding that some have been allowed to reassemble and launch themselves as a political party -- a reference towards the Jamaatud Dawa (JuD).

The policy of duplicity in the fight against militancy is a catastrophe, he said.

PkMAP Senator Usman Kakar said that this would have to be admitted that Pakistan fought war on terror after getting billions of dollars from the US.

He deplored that the foreign and interior policies of the country rested with the military establishment and asked Pakistan to go away with the policy of ""good and bad Taliban"".

Kakar said that the parliament should be strengthened.

""This is not the 'do more policy' of Trump rather he has declared war against Pakistan this time,"" he stressed.

Leader of the Opposition Aitzaz Ahsan also showed his disappointment over the policy statement of the defence minister.

Criticising the government he said that it was the civilian government that had to revive the sovereignty of the parliament but deplored that the narrative of the government was weak following Trump's statement.

He said that the US ambassador should have been summoned in the Foreign Office to register a protest over Trump's remarks.

The government should have summoned the joint sitting of the parliament, he said.

Earlier, the defence minister, while giving the policy statement on the floor of the house said, ""No country in the world has done more than Pakistan to counter the menace of terrorism. No country in the world has suffered more than Pakistan from the scourge of terrorism, often perpetrated from outside our borders. It is, therefore disappointing that the US policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation in this effort.""

He said that Pakistan had been and would continue to be part of the global counter terrorism efforts.

""Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country"".

Instead of relying on the false narrative of ""safe havens"", the US needs to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism, he added.

The minister said that non-resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains the primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region.

The minister will conclude the debate today.

The house also adopted a report of the Committee of the Whole containing resolution for the revival of the student unions in the colleges and universities across the country.","[{'uri':

Speaking to Russia's ""Afghanistan"" daily, Russian Presidential Envoy to Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov blasted Trump's Pakistan strategy and insisted that Islamabad is ""a key regional player to negotiate with.""

""Putting pressure [on Pakistan] may seriously destabilise the region-wide security situation and result in negative consequences for Afghanistan,"" the Russian presidential envoy to Kabul said.

China echoed a similar sentiment on Tuesday. Addressing a daily news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying defended Pakistan after Trump's speech and praised her country's ""all-weather"" friend for making ""great sacrifices"" and ""important contributions"" in the fight against terrorism. Mrs Chunying also called on the international community to ""fully recognize"" Islamabad's struggle against terrorism.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Moscow'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Moscow'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envoy_(title)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Envoy (title)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"", 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}]",http://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2017-08-24/pressure-on-pakistan-to-hurt-afghanistan-russia-1503523151-9068.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.2862745098039216,241230480,1,nation.com.pk,news,The Nation,Russia Pakistan Afghanistan Donald Trump Moscow Envoy (title) Terrorism Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Islamabad Kabul China International community,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,28,0,2017-08-24

While addressing a press conference here in Bani Gala, PTI Chairman Imran Khan strongly criticised the federal government for what he said its ""muted response"" over the US president's ""ill-advised statement"" regarding Pakistan's role in the war against terrorism.

He strongly criticised the US president for being completely ignorant over regional affairs and dynamics of the war on terror. Calling the statement as a targeted campaign aimed to de-nuclearise Pakistan, the PTI chief called for summoning the joint sitting of the parliament to devise future course of action and convey a clear message to the US administration that it could not pin the blame of its failed policies on Pakistan.

Khan said that Trump's desire to give India an active role in Afghanistan severely lacked logic and seemed an attempt to undermine Pakistan's incredible human and economic sacrifices rendered for the elimination of terrorism through the US-led war on terror.

He lashed out at the government stating that neither the prime minister nor the foreign minister issued a statement in response to Trump's speech, even though China came to defend Pakistan.

""Country's political leadership is scared, which is why the army chief had to respond to the statement. They have their looted billions of dollars abroad and that is why they are afraid of responding,"" the PTI chief said.

Khan said that he had come out to fight on this front after looking at the poor response of the government.

""A unanimous message should be conveyed to the US that civilian and military leadership in the country are on the same page,"" he added.

""I want to ask the government and its foreign policy makers where were they when Indian lobbyists in Washington were busy influencing the US government and devising that strategy primarily aimed to de-nuclearise Pakistan,"" the PTI chief said.

""If you [Trump] want peace in Afghanistan, you need Pakistan as more troops and money will not serve the purpose,"" Khan advised President Trump.

He said that Pakistan had joined the US war contrary to the fact that no Pakistani was involved at any level in the 9/11 attacks.

Khan reiterated that he had opposed Pakistan's decision to join the US war after 9/11.

""Pakistan had no reason to take part in that war and had done a lot towards the end of fighting terrorism and sacrificed more than 70,000 lives and the economy suffered billions in losses in a war that was not even ours,"" he said.

""Our army has rendered huge sacrifices,"" Khan said, and added that the US aid was nothing compared to the losses Pakistan suffered, while fighting the war.

""US is speaking the language of India and any physical incursion in Pakistan's territory will have serious consequences,"" Khan warned.

He said that Trump had no idea as to who was the real terrorist and what were the issues in Afghanistan.

The PTI chief stressed the need to convey a strong message that Pakistan would not appease anyone at the cost of its national interest and its sovereignty.

The confused and flawed policy of the US government has pushed US much deeper into the Afghan quagmire, he said.

""Turning a blind eye to its own deadly mistakes and policies and assigning a greater role to India, sidelining Pakistan will bear no fruit but will worsen the situation in the region,"" Khan maintained.

He further stated that India was sponsoring terrorism using Afghan soil and the documented proofs in this regard had already been presented in the UN.

In these circumstances hailing India's role and threatening Pakistan for providing sanctuaries to terrorist is unjustified and exaggerated, the PTI chief said.

He demanded of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi to give a strong-worded message to the US administration instead of defending former PM ousted on corruption charges.

Responding to questions, Khan said that both Memogate and Dawn leaks scandals were aimed to realise foreign powers that civilian leadership wanted to curb terrorism but military did not want to do so.

About chief of army staff (COAS)'s response to Trump statement, Khan said that the army chief's were not supposed to give such statements but General Qamar Javed Bajwa gave one due to poor response from the civilian government.

To a question, if the PTI would offer treatment to Kalsoom Nawaz at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital (SKMCH), Khan said that it should.

The PTI on Wednesday also submitted an adjournment motion with the National Assembly demanding the speaker NA to adjourn the regular business of the house to discuss Trump's speech.","[{'uri':

""We are not looking for any material or financial assistance from the USA but trust, understanding and acknowledgement of our contributions,"" the COAS said while talking to David Hale, US Ambassador to Pakistan, who called on him at the GHQ.

""Collaboration and synergy of efforts among all the stakeholders is the key to success to bring this long drawn war in Afghanistan to its logical conclusion,"" the COAS said. The COAS said, ""Peace in Afghanistan is as important for Pakistan as for any other country. We have done a lot towards that end and shall keep on doing our best, not to appease anyone but in line with our national interests and national policy.""

David Hale briefed the COAS on the new US policy saying that the US valued Pakistan's role in the war against terror and was seeking cooperation from Pakistan to resolve the Afghan issue. It may be pointed out that the Director General, ISPR, during a press conference said in response to a question on Monday that Pakistan was a sovereign state and would take decisions according to its national interests whatever policy was announced by President Trump.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi dashed to Saudi Arabia on an emergency visit as US President Donald Trump announced the US policy on Afghanistan and South Asia. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had a significant meeting with Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom Muhammad bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz in Jeddah Palace. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia agreed to expand and strengthen their ties further in various spheres, including political, trade, economy and culture.

Federal Finance Minister Senator Ishaq Dar and Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif accompanied the premier in the visit. The sources told The News that US President Donald Trump's new policy towardsPakistan and Afghanistan also figured in the course of discussions.

Shahid Khaqan had an important meeting with Nawaz Sharif in Lahore a day earlier and it is understood that the prime minister took him into confidence on his visit to Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Abbasi who returned Islamabad late in the evening stayed for about eight hours in the coast city of the Kingdom.

The sources said that Prime Minister Abbasi briefed the Saudi leader about the situation in the region including its ties with India and worsening human rights situation in Indian Held Kashmir (IHK) and developments regarding Afghanistan. The regional situation including the affairs in the Arab world also figured in the talks, the sources added.

King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud was currently out of the Kingdom on a private visit. The Prime Minister Office (PMO) stated upon conclusion of the visit that during the meeting with the Crown Prince, the prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan's continued and steadfast support for the kingdom and its leadership.

The premier recounted the huge sacrifices and extraordinary efforts being made by Pakistan as a nation to root out terrorism and bring peace and stability. He also expressed solidarity with Saudi Arabia and reaffirmed Pakistan's pledge to support Saudi Arabia's sovereignty.

Meanwhile, Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani said if US committed any mistake, Pakistan would become a graveyard of its troops. He warned US President Donald Trump to stay within his limits, saying 'he must realise that people of Pakistan have the legacy and characteristics of Vietnam and Cambodia, as the senators poured scorn on him (Trump) for his anti-Pakistan statement.

Rabbani asserted, ""Trump must realise that we hail legacy of Vietnam and Cambodia...if he [Donald Trump] wants Pakistan to become a graveyard of the US soldiers, let it be so"". He was speaking during the debate in the House on Trump's warning to Pakistan. Rabbani's remarks evoked desk thumping by the senators.

He also suggested that Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif should postpone his scheduled visit to Washington in protest. ""I would suggest the foreign minister to cancel his trip to the US, as it would send a strong message,"" he believed.

In a policy statement on behalf of foreign minister, Defence Minister Khurran Dastgir Khan declared Trump's statement 'disappointing,' and said no country in the world had done more than Pakistan to counter the menace of terrorism.

The minister emphasised, ""No country in the world has suffered more than Pakistan from the scourge of terrorism, often perpetrated from outside our borders. It is, therefore, disappointing that the US policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation in this effort.""

He said that Pakistan had taken serious note of President Trump's statement, adding Pakistan had been and would continue to be part of the global counterterrorism efforts.

""Pakistan and the US have been close allies in the fight against terrorism, which is a common threat to all nations of the world. As a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country. Instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens, the US needs to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism,"" he noted.

The minister said that the threat to peace and security could not be isolated from the complex interplay of geopolitics, continued existence of festering disputes and pursuit of hegemonic policies, adding non-resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remained the primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region.

He said that Pakistan reiterated its view that there was no exclusive military solution to the crisis in Afghanistan. The military action during the last 17 years had not brought peace to Afghanistan, and it was not likely to do so in the future. Only an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned politically negotiated solution could lead to sustainable peace in Afghanistan.

""Pakistan is committed to working with the international community towards the common objective of defeating the forces of terrorism and promoting peace and stability in the South Asian region,"" he maintained.

The opposition senators termed the policy statement by the minister disappointing, saying it was too late, and the stance taken by the government as well as its response should have been quicker.

PPP's Sherry Rehman said that it was position of the US president and to some extent it related to his bureaucracy, which should have been given a befitting response by the Foreign Office.

She was all praise for the stand taken by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who plainly told US Ambassador David Hale that Pakistan did not want material or financial assistance from the US but needed to be trusted and treated with respect.

""This message should have been given by the civilian leadership. Through his statement, Trump defeated America's objectives in Afghanistan,"" she regretted.

She called upon both the US and Pakistan to look into their mistakes, adding Pakistan had paid a huge price in the war against terrorism and discrediting would not augur well for the US.

Rabbani said that Committee of the Whole would discuss the statement of Donald Trump while a sub-committee comprising Senators Mushahid Hussain Sayed, Sherry Rehman and others would prepare its recommendations, which would be sent to government for consideration after adopting by the House.

Senator Farhatullah Babar of the PPP said that President Trump was wrong in pointing fingers at Pakistan but while rejecting the US President's arrogance, Pakistan must also look inwardly whether time had not come for abandoning the failed policy of selective treatment of the militant groups.

He deplored that the US was blaming Pakistan for its failure in Afghanistan. ""But at the same time, we must also revisit the policy of nurturing some militants to advance our security and foreign policy agendas in the regions,"" he added.

Babar proposed to the government to boost relations with Russia, China and Iran, instead of relying on the US, as the ties between the two had gone sour after Trump took over.

Opposition Leader in the Senate Aitzaz Ahsan regretted how weakly the policy statement by the government handled the situation. The very thing, according to him, the government had to take was giving demarche to the US ambassador to Pakistan.

The government should have applied ""a lock and g lock"" to tell the US that Pakistan can block the supply routes to transport fuel and other supplies for Nato troops stationed in Afghanistan, he said, adding, ""Then we could have established the civilian supremacy"".

Senators Nehal Hashmi and Usman Khan Kakar objected to US Ambassador David Hale's meeting with COAS and said the envoy should have met the democratically elected government instead of meeting the military establishment.

""The establishment frames foreign and security policies and then they blame Parliament whenever the country is in trouble. Parliament should be empowered as it's the only solution to all the problems,"" he added.

Senator Hashmi said that the US was an occupation force in South Asia, which must pack up from the region, as that was the only way out to restore lasting peace in the region.

He questioned the meeting of the US ambassador with army chief, saying: ""In which capacity he [David Hale] is meeting the army chief when there is a democratically elected government in the country.""

Hashmi demanded of the US ambassador to tender an apology for meeting the army chief and ignoring the civilian leadership. He pointed out that the 'huge complex of US embassy being constructed in Islamabad should be reduced in size as the building was nothing but to do spying on Pakistan.'

Senator Saeedul Hassan Mandokhel of PML-Q announced in the House that he was scheduled to go to the US for getting medical treatment but after Trump's statement, he decided to get treatment in Quetta - his hometown - or anywhere in the world, but not in the US.

PML-N Senator Abdul Qayyum called on the US to learn from history and said that involving India showed the US was not serious in resolving Afghan issue.

He made it clear that there could be no peace in the region without resolution of longstanding dispute of Kashmir, but the US was acting as a silent spectator over Indian atrocities in Held Kashmir which showed its nefarious motives.

PPP Senator Taj Haider said that war was in the favour of a superpower, and this was what the US was doing to linger on its hegemony. He said that it was time for Pakistan to get rid of US monopoly ""as it has been befooling us for the last seventy years.""

The other lawmakers called for a joint session of Parliament to give a clear message to the US not to 'mess up with Pakistan' as it would not benefit it given the sacrifices by the latter in the war against terrorism.

Meanwhile, Pakistan taking note of President Trump's statement outlining elements of a new US policy on Afghanistan and South Asia said that no country in the world had done more than Pakistan to counter the menace of terrorism.

""No country in the world has suffered more than Pakistan from the scourge of terrorism, often perpetrated from outside our borders. It is, therefore, disappointing that the US policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation in this effort,"" the Foreign Office in its preliminary comments on the US president's policy statement on ""Afghanistan and South Asia"", said.

Pakistan has been and will continue to be part of the global counter-terrorism efforts. Pakistan and the United States have been close allies in the fight against terrorism, which is a common threat for all the nations of the world.

As a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country. ""Instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens, the US needs to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism,"" Foreign Office stressed.

The threat to peace and security could not be isolated from the complex interplay of geopolitics, continued existence of festering disputes and pursuit of hegemonic policies. ""Non-resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains the primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region,"" the Foreign Office pointed out.

Pakistan reiterated its view that there is no exclusive military solution to the crisis in Afghanistan. The military action during the last 17 years has not brought peace to Afghanistan, and it is not likely to do so in the future.

Only an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned politically negotiated solution can lead to sustainable peace in Afghanistan, Foreign office said. Pakistan is committed to working with the international community towards the common objective of defeating the forces of terrorism and to promote peace and stability in the South Asian region, Foreign office concluded.

It may be pointed out here that the federal cabinet in its regular session discussed the President Trump's strategy on Afghanistan and South Asia. The Cabinet has mandated the prime minister to take up the issue in detail in the meeting of the National Security Committee, already scheduled to be held on August 24 (today).","[{'uri':

""We have some leverage,"" Tillerson told reporters, ""in terms of aid, their status as a non-Nato alliance partner -- all of that can be put on the table."" During a press briefing held at the State Department to expand on Trump's Afghanistan and South Asia strategy, Tillerson conditioned the US support to Pakistan saying, ""Pakistan must adopt a different approach, and we are ready to work with them to help them protect themselves against these terrorist organisations."" Otherwise, Tillerson suggested, ""we have some leverage that's been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as a non-Nato alliance partner. All of that can be put on the table.""

The US has been blaming Pakistan for providing safe havens to militant outfits. Tillerson hinted that this became the focal point of the new strategy that took months of deliberations. ""We undertook a fairly comprehensive review of our relationships in Pakistan and our relationships with India. And we see this approach as requiring an integration of all three of those strategies, and use Pakistan, India to also bring pressure to bear on the situation in Afghanistan,"" he said.

He hammered out Islamabad's role to bring stability in Afghanistan by suggesting that, ""Pakistan in particular can play an important role here, certainly in delivering the Taliban to the negotiating table."" Once again, he highlighted that Pakistan suffered acts of terrorism. ""We stand ready to help Pakistan address terrorist organisations inside of their country, but they must -- they must adopt a different approach themselves,"" he emphasised.

The secretary also acknowledged the strenuous relationship between the US and Pakistan and declared that the over the last few years there has been a real erosion in the confidence between the two governments. ""There's been an erosion in trust because we have witnessed terrorist organisations being given safe havens inside of Pakistan to plan and carry out attacks against US servicemen, US officials, disrupting peace efforts inside of Afghanistan,"" he said, adding, ""We are going to be conditioning our support for Pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area. We want to work with Pakistan in a positive way, but they must change their approach.""

While asking Pakistan to support the US efforts in Afghanistan and use its influence to deliver the Taliban to the negotiating table, Tillerson noted that the US will act as a facilitator. ""We are there to facilitate and ensure that there is a pathway for reconciliation and peace talks,"" he said. ""As the pressure begins to take hold, we believe we already know there are certain moderate elements of the Taliban who we think will be ready and develop a way forward.""

Answering a question, Tillerson stressed that the US will ""attack terrorists wherever they live, and we have put people on notice that if you are harbouring and providing safe havens to terrorists, be warned. Be forewarned. And we are going to engage with those who are providing safe haven and ask them to change what they're doing and help us help them."" Not ruling out any unilateral strikes, he said, ""The greatest benefactor, other than the Afghan people themselves, to achieve stability and peace in Afghanistan, are the people of Pakistan.""

About the possible capacity and responsibility of the US military in Afghanistan, the secretary said, ""The fighting will still be borne by the Afghan force, by their military and their security forces, but we believe that we can turn the tide of what has been a losing battle."" Calling it the essence of the strategy, he repeated that the US will facilitate Afghan government and the Taliban to come to some conclusion around how they want to govern themselves. ""But it's is going to be up to the Afghan government and the representatives of the Taliban to work through a reconciliation process on what will serve their needs and achieve the American people's objectives, which is security,"" he said.","[{'uri': 'wajid_ali_syed@thenews.com.pk', 'name': 'Wajid Ali Syed', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Department of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}]",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2017-08-24/l_225638_044116_print.jpg,eng-3382459,0.08235294117647052,241230900,1,thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,Rex Tillerson Terrorism Pakistan Afghanistan United States Secretary of State Taliban United States Department of State South Asia Islamabad Demographics of Afghanistan Politics of Afghanistan United States Armed Forces,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center-right,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,35,0,2017-08-24

By announcing a shift in policy from its earlier 'Nation Building' approach to now out and out armed conflict with voices of dissent in Afghanistan, the US has flushed down the gutter the lives of its 2,300 soldier, 16 years of work and one trillion dollars spent on the 'Nation Building' policy.

Pakistani political leadership and military top brass need to sit together and make sure that the country doesn't face any embarrassing situation like the OBL debacle. These views were shared by defence and foreign policy experts at Jang Forum held in relevance with Donald Trump's recent criticism and allegations against Pakistan.

The panelists included former central Media Coordinator PML-N Muhammad Mahdi, former additional foreign secretary Nazir Hussain, Dean and Head of the Department Political Science University of Punjab Prof Dr Rasheed Ahmed Khan and Defence Strategy Expert Air Vice Marshal (Retd) Anwar Mahmood Khan. The forum was moderated by Moayyed Jafri.

Nazir Hussain said the statement by Trump regarding Pakistan can be broken down into three prongs. The first of which was his appreciation for the role Pakistan has played and the sacrifices laid by Pakistan in fighting terrorism, which is a welcome admission and acknowledgement coming from the American President. The second part is the allegation of terrorist sanctuaries, which ISPR had preemptively denied in the presser a day before Trump's speech and had offered third party verification to disprove that allegation, however, Washington apparently disagrees. The third part was India's role in the Indo-Pacific region and support for expansion of India's role and influence in the region.

The former additional foreign secretary said with these trends in mind, Pakistani strategists will need to ask themselves the age old questions, what is better for Pakistan's security and interests in the long term vis-Ã -vis Afghanistan, is it a Taliban coalition or Indian dominated controlled Western Border of Afghanistan.

He said Pakistan should send a strong message back to Washington and the best way to do that is through the platform of the parliament. Central Media Coordinator PML-N Muhammad Mahdi said that the American policy regarding Afghanistan is mostly CPEC-centric and how to safeguard the economic interests of its allies. He said: ""We should consider that the tone of foreign leaders when talking about a country depends heavily on what kind of leadership is present in the country. We must not forget that we have recently deposed a popular prime minister who had tow-third majority.""

He said Hussain Haqqani was among the team that prepared Trump's final policy statement over South Asia Pakistani political leadership and military top brass need to sit together and make sure that the country doesn't face any embarrassing situation like the OBL debacle, he said. We will need to trust our foreign office and every stakeholder will need to be on board to reach a policy stance over this.

Dean and Head of the Department Political Science University of Punjab Prof Dr Rasheed Ahmed Khan said the statement by the American president is the outburst of a leader outraged by his failures in Afghanistan. Policy shift by Washington should be a major concern for Pakistan because Trump's principal adviser has stated: ""The solution to Afghanistan is not in Afghanistan, but in Pakistan"". However, nothing drastic will ensue right after these statements. The US will most likely threaten Pakistan with drone strikes deep within our territory, he opined. Pakistan, he said, should not fall for the US pressure but should focus their own strategic and regional interests while crafting its policy.

Defense Strategy Expert Air Vice Marshal (Retd) Anwar Mahmood Khan said by announcing a shift in policy from its earlier 'Nation Building' approach to now out and out armed conflict with voices of dissent in Afghanistan, the US has flushed down the gutter the lives of its 2300 soldier, 16 years of work and one trillion dollars spent on the 'Nation Building' policy. He said this outburst also marks the failure of Pakistani lobbyists and foreign office in Washington. He said foreign policy is a reflection of internal policy and a country that acquired $ 35 billion debt in the past four years cannot hardly stand up to such statements.

He said Pakistan Army has arguably proven itself to be the most potent fighting force against terrorism as they are the only one to have defeated terrorism. He said it took Pakistan 70 years to mend fences with Afghanistan and it might take 70 more to do it again because of the rapidly convoluting geopolitical situation in this region. He was of the view that favoritism in appointments to foreign office and other key policymaking institutions need to end if we are actually serious about this situation.","[{'uri':

He also demanded of the Afghan government to take more responsibility towards peace and economic development. Trump also called out Pakistan by asking it to act against 'alleged' terrorist safe havens, and demonstrate its commitment towards 'civilisation, order and peace'.

One surprise in Trump's speech was India's 'forced entry and role' in Afghanistan's future development and stability. While appreciating USA's strategic partnership with India, Trump 'hoped' that New Delhi would help the US in ensuring long-term peace and stability in South Asia, especially because India made 'billions from trade' with the US. On Taliban's front, Trump also kept the door open for reconciliation in the future. ""Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan,"" said Trump.

Pakistan's only silver lining on Tuesday was China's explicit support of Pakistan and snub of Trump's statement, calling on the international community to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts and sacrifices in counter-terrorism in the region.

In the wake of these developments, Pakistani civil and military leadership, in recent talks with US and Afghan officials, has conveyed a few categorical messages such as:

* Pakistan remains committed to peace in Afghanistan as much it is for its own soil. Additionally, Pakistan would also unconditionally support any regional initiative, be it the Quadrilateral Support Group or Moscow initiatives, in order to pursue some breakthrough in the stalled peace process.

* Pakistan continues to believe in and pursue regional economic activity, very much in the spirit of its partnership with China through China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). CPEC is also one such initiative through which, by bringing Afghanistan on board, the aim of regional economic activity could also be achieved.

* In terms of foreign military policies, Pakistan does not agree with the Afghan demand of a third-party verification of counter-terrorism actions either here or in Afghanistan. This is because third-party verification and monitoring is complicated and fraught with risks due to absence of trust between the two countries. Pakistan wants to develop a bilateral engagement mechanism in the light of the March 15 meeting between Sartaj Aziz - the then adviser to prime minister - and the Afghan National Security Adviser Hanif Atmar.

* On border control, Pakistan wants to institute a bilateral border management mechanism to strengthen controls over cross-border movement of terrorists. Apparently, Afghan leadership wants to address the issue of security first. This is rooted in the raging Taliban-Daesh (IS) insurgency that claims dozens of lives every day. In early August, a joint Taliban-Daesh attack in Mirza Olang village in Sayyad district of Sari Pul killed dozens of people. Even though the Taliban categorically denied any such joint operation, local witness accounts contradicted Taliban's claims. Such operations could pose a major threat not only for the security forces in Afghanistan, but also for major regional stakeholders who had previously treated both the militant groups with a different prism.

Understandably, it makes it difficult for Afghan President Ghani and other leaders to push the peace process. Afghans are also wary of abrupt border closures by Pakistani authorities. Thus, this leads to the question of why should Pakistan make its policy contingent upon that of the Trump administration?

Never before has there been a greater convergence among USA, India and Afghanistan, presumably against Pakistan and its allies. And they speak with the same tone as far as their view on Pakistan is concerned. With such narratives, it also makes it difficult for the Pakistani policymakers to formulate a joint regional security policy.

But setting aside these messages, Pakistan's foreign policy woes are not confined to US-Afghanistan-India alone. Of late, even Chinese leaders have been politely asking Pakistan to do something demonstrable as far as indiscriminate counter-terrorism measures are concerned. Chinese deputy foreign minister and other officials have reportedly referred to the negative perception - which they say the Indo-US-Afghan narrative on Pakistan - that keeps generating in important capitals.

Pakistan, thus, needs to have a clear and direct policy-oriented approach if it needs to take its allies on board and implement effective counter-terror policies on the Pak-Afghan border.

Pakistan remains beset with its own internal dynamics and lack of a clear vision on terrorism and extremism. It is still fearful of a direct confrontation with the Afghan and Pakistani proponents of 'jihadism', ie Taliban and al Qaeda.

With a semblance of control over the spiral of terrorism, officials are afraid of un-ruffling the hornet's nest at home. These fears, thus, reinforce the Chinese officials' concerns of Islamabad's dire need of formulating a clear counter-terror policy - both domestic and regional - if it needs to achieve across the board consensus on the issue. In terms of Afghanistan's future and peace, Washington might have finally acknowledged that a military solution would never prevail in Afghanistan. Therefore, regional diplomacy initiatives - involving China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan - with active participation of USA, India and Afghanistan could provide a viable solution to a war that currently appears endless. Anything to the contrary is only likely to fuel conflict more than ever and keep the entire region on tenterhooks.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChinaâPakistan_Economic_Corridor',

While this may not necessarily denote a major shift in relations, there is a lot between the lines which aught not to be missed as far as a prospective shift in the US policy is concerned. Trump's policy announcement thus far is a barebones policy that still lacks details. However, its significance lies in the fact that such warnings, which were earlier communicated by junior or mid-ranking State Department officials, were for the first time loudly announced by the country's president.

The key points highlighted in Trump's speech pertain to a short-to-medium-term redesign of the Afghan policy by increasing the number of troops in Afghanistan as an indication of American commitment to ending the conflict with victory and not as Washington's Vietnam; seeking Indian partnership towards that end; and making aid to Pakistan conditional on its performance towards cleaning up the area of terrorists that bother the US or its allies. To summarise, what may be looked upon by certain quarters as a strategic shift is a tactical development with two key aspects. First, that it is now an even more narrowly defined conditional relationship. It will now be a day-to-day 'over-the-counter' kind of linkage in which Pakistan will be paid every time it delivers something that the US wants. The more critical aspect of course is that India has been taken onboard not just as an American partner but also in an advisory capacity. This means that now on there will be greater noise on Pakistan's performance, especially if it turns out to be lackluster. Although the US's main concern would be the Haqqani network, other groups such as the LeT/JuD and Jaishe Muhammad will also be under greater scrutiny.

The reaction in Pakistan is a mix of frustration, anger and disgust - what does the US expect us to do when we are victims of terror ourselves? Didn't we catch the al Qaeeda suspects and lay down the lives of our citizens and soldiers in the process? It was recently that the new army chief, General Qamar Bajwa, spoke about the need for the US to recognise what Pakistan has done.

Notwithstanding what we ourselves believe, the greater issue is to understand the implications and options that aught to be adopted without enhancing the overall cost to the country.

In the short term a solution has been found with China announcing support for Pakistan. Beijing would certainly try not to allow Washington to turn Af-Pak into a checkmate vis-Ã -vis Beijing's dominant position in the Korean Peninsula. The announcement is meant to caution the US against increasing drone attacks, especially inside Pakistan. But despite this friendly assistance, there is a need for Pakistan to engage with the US and its regional neighbours, Afghanistan and India, independently. It would be short-sighted, for instance, to respond through allowing organisations such as the Difae Pakistan Council (DPC) to put up a road-show or permit various militant organisations to express Pakistan's foreign policy.

There is a lot both good and bad which needs to be read between the lines such as the fact that increasing the number of troops would result in American forces continuing to need Pakistan's assistance and thus an opportunity for a bilateral dialogue. The relationship needn't slip into a greater abyss because Islamabad couldn't think imaginatively. The relations with the US are not just about diminishing coalition support funds but also aid from international financial institutions such as the IMF that look towards Washington for a nod, or a large extent of Pakistan's exports tied to the Western market. Despite that there are severe reservations in Europe regarding Donald Trump's policies, a lot of states may not differ on the issue of the opacity of Pakistan's counter-terrorism goals.

Islamabad aught to re-engage with the US not in a patron-client relationship but as two sovereign states searching for solutions to the common problem of terrorism. The initiative has to be restarted with better diplomacy with both the US and in the South Asian region. Our diplomatic corps and its members have failed in making use of opportunities. In Washington, the current ambassador and his team have not succeeded in going beyond photo-ops, the same way as Pakistan's diplomats in Kabul have failed to reach out to people and capitalise on the common man's goodwill. As for the US, it still requires Islamabad's assistance to start a dialogue with the Taliban.

The American president's seeming policy shift does not bode a doomsday scenario for Pakistan. In fact, as more troops land in Afghanistan, Washington may find out that even the Russians have stakes in the ongoing conflict in the region. The situation is far too complex for Washington to hold one country responsible. The US upping the ante is a complex affair that even Washington needs to think through.

It is essential for policymakers in Pakistan to look at this development as an opportunity to think through its options starting from bringing about a political solution for Balochistan, absence of which will keep Islamabad vulnerable. Solution, in turn, means dialogue rather than use of direct or indirect force.

Last, but not the least, this is the time to hear voices rather than curb dialogue. Pakistan needs alternative voices to the security and foreign policy debate. Shutting these down will not help the country, its institutions or the future.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald

Addressing media here, Imran said that Trump's desire to give India an active role in Afghanistan severely lacks logic and seems a blatant attempt to undermine Pakistan's incredible human and economic sacrifices rendered for the elimination of terrorism through US-led war on terror. He said that the federal government should convene a joint sitting of parliament to devise future course of action and should convey a clear message to the US administration that it cannot pin the blame of its failed policies on Pakistan. The PTI chairman lashed out at government stating that neither prime minister nor foreign minister issued a statement in response to Trump's speech, even though China came to our defence. ""Country's political leadership is scared, which is why the army chief had to respond to Trump's statement. They have their looted billions of dollars abroad and that is why they are afraid of responding."" ""A unanimous message should be conveyed to the US that civilian and military leadership in the country are on the same page,"" he said. The PTI chief condemned the statement of the US president stating that Pakistan had been facing negative impacts of an unstable Afghanistan for decades. ""The allegations signals that Trump has no understanding of the South Asian region or the dynamics of war on terror,"" he added. Imran Khan recalled that he had opposed Pakistan's decision to join US war after the 9/11 attacks. ""Pakistan had no reason to take part in that war.

""We are not looking for any material or financial assistance from USA but trust, understanding and acknowledgement of our contributions,"" Gen Bajwa told US Ambassador in Pakistan David Hale who called on him at the GHQ in Rawalpindi.

The meeting comes a day after US President Donald Trump said his country 'could no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for militants' and warned 'it had much to lose by continuing to harbor terrorists'.

According to the ISPR, the US ambassador briefed the army chief about the new US policy regarding Afghanistan. The ambassador said that US values Pakistan's role in the war against terror and is seeking cooperation from Pakistan to resolve the Afghan issue.

Speaking on the occasion, the COAS said peace in Afghanistan was as important for Pakistan as for any other country. ""We have done a lot towards that end and shall keep on doing our best, not to appease anyone but in line with our national interest and national policy,"" he said.

Collaboration and synergy of effort between all stakeholders is the key to success to bring this long-drawn war in Afghanistan to its logical conclusion, the COAS said.

A day earlier, Trump committed the United States to an open-ended conflict in Afghanistan, signaling he would dispatch more troops to America's longest war and vowing 'a fight to win'.

Trump insisted that others - Afghan government, Pakistan, India and NATO allies - step up their own commitment to resolving the 16-year conflict, but he saved his sharpest words for Pakistan.

Senior US officials warned security assistance for Pakistan could be reduced unless the nuclear-armed nation cooperated more in preventing militants from using safe havens on its soil.

A day earlier, the ambassador had similarly briefed Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif on Washington's new policy and statements made by Trump regarding Pakistan.

During the meeting, Asif had told the ambassador that Pakistan would continue to work with the international community to eliminate the menace of terrorism.

Prime Minister Shahid Khaqab Abbasi has presided over a meeting of the federal cabinet to review the situation arising out of the US policy and Trump's warning to Pakistan.

A statement issued after the cabinet meeting advised the Trump administration that 'instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens, US needs to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism'.

""No country in the world has suffered more than Pakistan from the scourge of terrorism, often perpetrated from outside our borders. It is, therefore, disappointing that the US policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation in this effort,"" a statement from the Foreign Ministry said.

""Pakistan and the United States have been close allies in the fight against terrorism, which is a common threat for all nations of the world. As a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country,"" the statement said.

China has openly defended Pakistan after Trump's threatening remarks.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Pakistan was on the front line in the struggle against terrorism and had made 'great sacrifices' and 'important contributions' in the fight. ""We believe that the international community should fully recognise PakistanÂ´s anti-terrorism,"" she told a daily news briefing.

Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani warned US of Vietnam- and Cambodia-type situation in case of any 'misadventure'. ""Pakistani people have characteristics and customs like that of people in Vietnam and Cambodia ... if Trump wants Pakistan to be a graveyard of the American army, we will welcome them"". He asked Defence Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan whether foreign minister was going to the US on his scheduled visit even after anti-Pakistan statement by Trump. ""If yes, he must postpone his visit to give them a befitting response,"" he opined.

The House witnessed emotional speeches on the US president's remarks against Pakistan and maintained that it was right time to forge national unity. The senators were of the view that Trump was totally wrong in pointing fingers at Pakistan but while rejecting his arrogance, Islamabad must also look inwardly whether time had not come for abandoning the failed policy of selective treatment of the militant groups.

Taking part in the discussion, Senator Farhatullah Babar deplored that the US was blaming Pakistan for its failures in Afghanistan. ""But at the same time, we must also revisit the policy of nurturing some militant groups to advance our security and foreign policy agendas in the region,"" he said.

Sherry Rehman regretted that the government issued a very weak statement in response to US president's remarks.

PML-F Senator Muzafar Shah demanded the government must review its foreign policy, especially towards the US.

Opposition Leader in Senate Aitzaz Ahsan was of the view that the government must summon US ambassador and register protest over Trump's speech.

Earlier initiating the debate, Defence Minister Khurram Dastagir said Pakistan had played its role more than any other country in eliminating terrorism. He said that no country had suffered as much as Pakistan in the war against terror. Terming the Trump's statement as disappointing, the minister said that the US president had ignored the unmatched sacrifices Islamabad had rendered in its fight against terrorism. He asked the US president to extend support to Pakistan in eliminating terrorism instead of talking about the 'save havens in Islamabad'.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Senate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Vietnam'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Vietnam'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistanis', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistanis'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khurram_Dastgir_Khan', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Khurram Dastgir Khan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'House of Lords'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raza_Rabbani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Raza Rabbani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Parliament'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Military'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cambodia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Cambodia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chairman'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitzaz_Ahsan', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Aitzaz Ahsan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry_Rehman', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sherry Rehman'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(F)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Muslim League (F)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhatullah_Babar', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Farhatullah Babar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_(parliamentary)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Opposition (parliamentary)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}]",http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/005fe2a93d2244c29717a935b9af066d.jpg ,eng-3382459,-0.207843137254902,241236840,1,dailytimes.com.pk,news,Daily Times,United States Senate Pakistan Foreign minister Islamabad Vietnam Afghanistan Pakistanis Khurram Dastgir Khan House of Lords Raza Rabbani Donald Trump Parliament Military Cambodia Chairman Aitzaz Ahsan Sherry Rehman Pakistan Muslim League (F) Farhatullah Babar Opposition (parliamentary) Foreign policy War on Terror Terrorism,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,14,2,2017-08-24

""It was more of an apology [to America],"" remarked Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani.

Lawmakers from across the aisle also called for revisiting the terms of Pakistan's engagement with the US, and clearly telling it that Islamabad had the option to deny it use of its territory and airspace.

""Trump must realise that we hail the legacy of Vietnam and Cambodia. If he wants Pakistan to become a graveyard for US troops, let him do so,"" Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani observed.

When Mr Dastgir told him that the foreign minister would be travelling to the US, Mr Rabbani said the visit should have been cancelled after Mr Trump's remarks. ""It will send a clear message,"" he said, as members thumped their desks.

In his opening statement, the defence minister said Pakistan had taken note of Mr Trump's statement.

As a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow its territory to be used against any country. Instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens, the US needs to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism. The threat to peace and security cannot be isolated from the complex interplay of geopolitics, the continued existence of festering disputes and the pursuit of hegemonic policies. The non-resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remained the primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region, he said.

The defence minister said there was no exclusive military solution to the crisis in Afghanistan. Military action over the last 17 years had not brought peace to Afghanistan, and it was unlikely to do so in the future.

He said that only an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and politically-negotiated solution could lead to a sustainable peace, and Pakistan was committed to working with the international community towards the common objective of defeating the forces of terrorism and promoting peace and stability in South Asia.

During the discussion, Senator Abdul Qayyum claimed that a conspiracy was being hatched against 'nuclear Pakistan', saying: ""They want to deprive us of our nuclear weapons"".

Commenting on America's recently-revised Afghanistan and South Asia policy, retired Gen Qayyum noted that the US must learn from history and avoid using brute force to resolve an intricate political issue.

He said encouraging Indian involvement in Afghanistan would compound the issue, as India is involved in fomenting militancy in Pakistan. ""We reject the policy of victimising Pakistan for the US' own failures and the Afghan government's incompetence,"" he said.

He suggested a regional approach involving all stakeholders, including the Afghan Taliban.

Pakistan Peoples Party Senator Farhatullah Babar said Mr Trump was wrong to point fingers at Pakistan, but urged the government to also look inward, asking whether the time had come to abandon the failed policy of selective treatment of militant groups.

Mr Babar deplored that the US was blaming Pakistan for its failure in Afghanistan, but added that at the same time we must revisit the policy of nurturing some militants to advance our security and foreign policy agendas in the region, he said.

He said point seven of the National Action Plan was that ""defunct outfits will not be allowed to operate under other names"", which had not been acted upon. Worse still, instead of taking action, recently-banned militant outfits were allowed to reassemble and launch themselves as a political party, he said.

Blocking the UN move to impose sanctions against the head of a banned militant outfit does raise questions, he said.

""When bin Laden was found hiding in Abbottabad and a Pakistani passport and identity card was recovered from Mullah Mansour Akhtar, questions asked about such issues in parliament went unanswered, while banned outfits struted around as charity organisations.""

Senator Nehal Hashmi said the US ambassador had committed contempt of parliament by holding a meeting with the chief of army staff, and asked in what capacity he had met with the army chief when parliament and a democratic government are in place. ""They want to create divisions,"" he remarked.

Senator Usman Kakar claimed that the 'good Taliban-bad Taliban' policy continued to prevail, adding that foreign policy should be framed by parliament, but everything was in the hands of the establishment. Jehanzeb Jamaldini agreed that foreign policy should be under democratic forces.

The discussion will continue when the house meets on Thursday, and the defence minister will wind up the discussion.","[{'uri': 'iftikhar_a_khan@dawn.com', 'name': 'Iftikhar A.

At his Tuesday afternoon news briefing, Mr Tillerson also asked India to remove the reasons that create unstable elements inside the country.

""There are areas where perhaps even India can take some steps of rapprochement on issues with Pakistan to improve the stability within Pakistan and remove some of the reasons why they deal with these unstable elements inside their own country,"" he said.

Such a veiled and meek reference to the issues that divide the two neighbours cannot persuade India to resume talks with Pakistan nor can it convince New Delhi to do some soul-searching, as Mr Tillerson suggested. But it does indicate a realisation in Washington that India does bear some responsibility for tensions in a region where President Donald Trump sees the possibility of a nuclear conflict, as he mentioned in his Monday night speech.

Indicates that New Delhi does bear some responsibility for instability in Pakistan

The secretary also did not explain why he thought India would be interested in improving stability within Pakistan, particularly when Washington endorses New Delhi's position that all disputes between the neighbours should be resolved in bilateral talks, without any mediation. And he reiterated this position at the briefing as well, saying: ""India and Pakistan, they have their own issues that they have to continue to work through."" Then he added his advice to India to help stabilise Pakistan.

Mr Tillerson said that during months-long discussion on the new South Asia strategy, US policymakers also discussed the measures they could take to persuade Pakistan to stop its alleged support to the Afghan Taliban. These include ending or reducing US aid and military assistance to Pakistan and rescinding Pakistan's status as a non-Nato partner.

The secretary said the United States came to this conclusion because ""we have witnessed terrorist organisations being given safe haven inside of Pakistan to plan and carry out attacks against US servicemen"".

""Don't you fear that too much pressure on Pakistan may destabilise Islamabad and strengthen the Taliban?"" asked a journalist.

""That is a concern, and that's why I made the comments I just made, that I think it's important that Pakistan begin to think about its ability to contain these groups as well,"" Mr Tillerson replied.

He acknowledged that the US alone was not going to change this dynamic with Pakistan. Other regional players with strong interest in Pakistan, such as China, should join this effort, he added.

""There are many areas in which we believe we should be having very productive dialogue that serves both of our interests and regional interest as well,"" Mr Tillerson said. ""(But ultimately,) Pakistan has to decide what is in Pakistan's best long-term interest from a security standpoint for themselves and for their people.""

The top US diplomat claimed that if Pakistan continued ""to allow Taliban and other such organisations to grow and maintain their presence inside the country"", they would become a threat to ""their stability and the survival of their government in the years ahead"".

Mr Tillerson said that Pakistan was important for the United States because Washington wanted to engage the Taliban in peace talks whenever the conditions permitted that.

""It, again, is why Pakistan is very important in this discussion as well. Pakistan can facilitate much of that discussion,"" he said.

The secretary said the United States had launched a global effort to deal with North Korea and wanted to use the same approach with Pakistan. ""We have to enlarge the circle of interest and bring others into the effort as well, and that's what we'll be doing with Pakistan as well.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'New Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'New Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington (state)'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington (state)'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear warfare'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Mediation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'North Korea'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'North Korea'}}}]",http://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/08/599e3bd27045f.jpg,eng-3382459,0.1058823529411765,241239600,1,dawn.com,news,Dawn,Rex Tillerson New Delhi Pakistan India Washington (state) Donald Trump Taliban United States Secretary of State Nuclear warfare Mediation South Asia Diplomat Terrorism Islamabad China North Korea,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,0,3,2017-08-24

Speaking to media here, Khan said no Afghan had been involved in 9/11 attacks in the United States, nor there was any terrorist outfit in Pakistan at that time.

""We participated in this war at the behest of the US, it wasn't our war,"" he maintained.

He said the US president was using same rhetoric against Pakistan as that of India, lamenting that the government didn't defend the country's case.

""Neither the prime minister, nor the foreign minister issued a statement in response to Trump's speech,"" the PTI chief said, adding that China came to our defence.

President Trump on Tuesday cleared the way for the deployment of thousands more US troops to Afghanistan Monday, backtracking from his promise to rapidly end AmericaÂ´s longest war, while pillorying ally Pakistan for offering safe haven to ""agents of chaos.""

""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,"" he said, warning that vital aid could be cut. ""That will have to change and that will change immediately.""

Khan said the US has made India stakeholder in Afghanistan and urged the prime minister to convey a strong message to Washington.

He said the country's political leadership is scared, which is why the army chief had to respond to Trump's statement. ""They have their looted billions of dollars abroad and that is why they are afraid of responding.""

""A unanimous message should be conveyed [to the US] that civilian and military leadership in the country are on same page; a joint session of the Parliament should also be summoned over US threat,"" he suggested.

He went on to say that India has been given a new role in Afghanistan, adding that Donald Trump has no understanding of the region.

Trump on Tuesday cleared the way for the deployment of more US troops to Afghanistan, while pillorying Pakistan for offering safe havens to 'agents of chaos'.

The US president indicated that this single-minded approach would extend to US relations with Pakistan. ""We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organisations,"" he said, warning that vital aid could be cut.

""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars. At the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,"" he claimed. ""That will have to change and that will change immediately.""

Senate passes right to information bill

The upper house on Wednesday had a detailed debate on Trump's speech. Before start of the discussion, Defence Minister Khurrum Dastagir in his opening statement said Pakistan had taken note of Trump's statement outlining elements of a new US policy on Afghanistan and South Asia.

""Pakistan has been and will continue to be part of the global counter terrorism efforts. Pakistan and the United States have been close allies in the fight against terrorism, which is a common threat to all nations of the world.

""As a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country. Instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens, the US needs to work with us to eradicate terrorism,"" he said.

The minister said threat to peace and security could not be isolated from the complex interplay of geopolitics, continued existence of festering disputes and pursuit of hegemonic policies. Non-resolution of the Kashmir dispute remains the primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region, he added.

Dastagir said there is no exclusive military solution to the crisis in Afghanistan. The military action during the last 17 years had not brought peace to Afghanistan, and it is not likely to do so in the future. Only an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned politically negotiated solution can lead to sustainable peace in Afghanistan.

Senate panel seeks report on cess collection in Fata

""Pakistan is committed to working with the international community towards the common objective of defeating the forces of terrorism and to promote peace and stability in the South Asian region,"" he said.

However, the members termed the government's stance weak. Some senators suggested that Pakistan revise it terms of engagement with US and deny it the use of its airspace and land route.

During the discussion, Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani also made some strong remarks. At one occasion, he said if US president wants Afghanistan to become a graveyard of US troops, let him do so. He said government of Pakistan should cancel visit of the new foreign minister to US after Trump's speech.

PPP's Farhatullah Babar said President Trump was wrong in pointing the finger at Pakistan but while rejecting the US President's arrogance, Pakistan must also look inwardly whether time had not come for abandoning the failed policy of selective treatment of militant groups.

""Point 7 of the National Action Plan (NAP) says 'defunct outfits will not be allowed to operate under other names' but it has not been acted upon. Worse still, instead of taking action recently banned militant outfits were allowed to reassemble and launch themselves as a political party, he said.

He said mere statements that there are no favourites among militant groups are not enough unless backed by action on the ground. Blocking the UN move to impose sanctions against head of a banned militant outfit does pose questions.

Babar said parliament was the forum where candid discussion could be held with all stakeholders on revisiting security policies instead of regurgitating a trite narrative that no one believed.

Taking part in the discussion, Senator (retd) General Qayyum said a big conspiracy was being hatched against nuclear-armed Pakistan. ""They want to deprive us of the nuclear weapons,"" he feared.

Qayyum urged that US must learn lessons of history and avoid use of brute force to solve an intricate political issue. He suggested regional approach involving all stakeholders including Afghan Taliban.

He said encouraging Indian involvement in Afghanistan will compound the issue as India is involved in fomenting militancy in Pakistan. ""We reject the policy of victimising Pakistan for the US own failures and Afghan government's incompetence.""

Usman Kakar of PKMAP claimed that the policy of good and bad Taliban still continued. He said foreign policy should be framed by parliament but everything was in the hands of the establishment. Jehanzeb Jamaldini of BNP-M endorsed the point that foreign policy should be under the control of democratic forces.

China's Foreign Ministry defended its ally Pakistan earlier this week after President Donald Trump said the United States could no longer be silent about militants using safe havens on Pakistani soil.

On Monday, Trump committed the United States to an open-ended conflict in Afghanistan, signaling he would send more troops to America's longest war and vowing ""a fight to win"".

He insisted that others -- the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and NATO allies -- step up their own commitment to resolving the 16-year conflict, but he saved his sharpest words for Pakistan.

Yang, who outranks China's foreign minister, told Tillerson on Wednesday that China was willing to coordinate with the United States on Afghanistan and make joint efforts to realise peace and stability there and in the region, according to a Chinese statement issued late that night.

""We must value Pakistan's important role on the Afghanistan issue, and respect Pakistan's sovereignty and reasonable security concerns,"" Yang told Tillerson.

Pakistan has been battling home-grown militants for years. It sees Afghanistan as a vital strategic interest and a bulwark against old rival, India. Islamabad denies harbouring militants, who move across the porous border with Afghanistan.

China and Pakistan consider each other ""all-weather friends"" and have close diplomatic, economic and security ties.

Beijing has its own security concerns in the region, in particular, any links between militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan and radical militant groups China blames for violence in its far western region of Xinjiang.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua in Beijing on Tuesday, according to a statement on Thursday. He praised Pakistan's efforts to combat extremism and to secure the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a development initiative central to President Xi Jinping's global Belt and Road development plan.

Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will chair a meeting of the National Security Committee around 11am.

The meeting will be attended by senior civil and military officials, including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, services chiefs, ministers of defence and interior.

This will be the newly-elected premier's second NSC meeting since taking charge. The first was chaired by the premier on August 16 and focused on Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir, unprovoked cross-border firing and killings after Independence Day celebrations were held in the occupied valley.

Abbasi on Wednesday also dashed to Saudi Arabia for a day-long visit following Trump's policy speech, and held a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

Trump announced his strategy for the region on Tuesday, harshly criticising Pakistan for providing a safe haven to ""agents of chaos"". Trump cleared the way for the deployment of thousands more US troops to Afghanistan, backtracking from his promise to rapidly end America's longest war, while pillorying ally Pakistan.

According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Wednesday, US Ambassador to Pakistan David Hale called on Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa at the GHQ.

Ambassador Hale said the US values Pakistan's role in the war against terror and is seeking cooperation from Pakistan to resolve the Afghan issue.

Laying emphasis that peace in Afghanistan was important for Pakistan as for any other country, the army chief said Pakistan has done a lot towards that end and shall keep on doing its best; not to appease anyone but in line with Pakistan's national interest and national policy.

Gen Bajwa said Pakistan is not looking for any material or financial assistance from the United States but rather trust, understanding and acknowledgment of its contributions.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Independence Day (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chief of staff'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kashmir'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Saudi Arabia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Saudi Arabia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_bin_Salman', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Mohammad bin Salman'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Javed_Bajwa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Qamar Javed Bajwa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Headquarters_(Pakistan_Army)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hale_(diplomat)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'David Hale (diplomat)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Ambassador to Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Inter-Services Public Relations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}]",https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2017-08-24/155015_093915_updates.jpg,eng-3382459,0.003921568627450966,241247760,1,geo.tv,news,GEO TV,Shahid Khaqan Abbasi United States National Security Council Donald Trump Islamabad United States Pakistan Independence Day (United States) Chief of staff Kashmir Saudi Arabia India Afghanistan Mohammad bin Salman Qamar Javed Bajwa General Headquarters (Pakistan Army) David Hale (diplomat) United States Ambassador to Pakistan Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan) Inter-Services Public Relations War on Terror,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,16,5,2017-08-24

President Donald Trump has finally found time from the internal White House crises and racial tensions within the United States to address a much-awaited cornerstone of his administration's foreign policy: the question of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The sixteen years of US involvement in Afghanistan have been marred with an inability to completely dismantle terror networks in the region. These failures have often been plastered-over by shifting the blame to the Pakistani government. Pakistan has been constantly told to 'do more' in its bid to fight terror. This is rhetoric that became routine during the Bush and Obama administrations.

However, the political landscape has changed significantly since those administrations. The American policy of asking Pakistan to do more to earn its foreign aid may no longer be feasible. Pakistan has already made progress in uprooting domestic terrorists and has alternative foreign policy options.

Pakistan has waged significant military and civilian sacrifices in the war on terror. Undeniable gains have been made in eradicating domestic terror networks from Pakistan. The ISPR claims no organized terror networks exist in Pakistan today. The US State Department released a report, in July of this year, admitting terrorist activity in Pakistan had sharply declined for the second year in a row.

The number of attacks has decreased, the security apparatus has been upgraded and various networks have been dismantled. While acts of terrorism are still weekly news, they are no longer daily news. There has been renewed resolve to fight terrorism through a national consensus, political support and military might.

Such evidence suggests that the days of training camps and militancy safe-havens in Pakistan's tribal regions may finally be coming to a close. For the Trump administration to not mention the gains Pakistan has made in eradicating terrorism in the prime-time address is a gross disservice to its ally.

Pakistan is also no longer isolated in its foreign policy. Pressure on Pakistan to accept US Aid may not be as applicable as it was when the War on Terror started. Efforts are already underway to seal the Pak-Afghan border which could significantly stop the inflow of proxy terror groups from neighboring territory.

Pakistan also has a pivotal regional ally in China. An ally who has invested far too heavily in the country to allow domestic policy to be dictated through US interests in the same way it used to be. United States pressure on Pakistan also comes at a time when hopes of a Russian-US reconciliation have evaporated and Pakistan is already looking north to a potential ally in Putin.

The Trump Administration has also taken two other problematic, yet important, policy initiatives. It has called for more troops in Afghanistan and has invited India as a stakeholder in the Afghanistan peace process.

The call for more troops will please Pentagon. It is a signature move for a Republican president at a time of crisis. Yet, the addition of nearly 5,000 troops will do little to change the balance of a war in Afghanistan that has proven to be all but unwinnable. It is perhaps another effort to reverse any policy that the Obama administration held dear.

However, given the lack of achievements hundreds of thousands of troops have made in the region in the past, there is little hope for the United States or its allies to conclude the effort with more troops. It is only through a comprehensive political dialogue that peace can be restored to Afghanistan.

It is also of note that the Trump administration has finally and formally accepted Indian ambitions to become a stakeholder in the Afghanistan peace process. This may be the most problematic policy declaration from the Trump speech for Pakistan.

Indian involvement in Afghanistan will destabilise the security balance in the region. It will further rejuvenate the use of Afghan territory to lodge proxy war in the Af-Pak region. Pakistan has already made formal complaints against Indian agencies using Afghanistan to plan attacks in Pakistan. The United States' eagerness to include India shows a clear signal that it is ready to sideline Pakistan from the Afghanistan end-game. Yet, any long-term solution in Afghanistan can only be successful with Pakistan's support given its decades-old involvement in the conflict and strategic ambitions.

India's involvement in Afghanistan will also strengthen Chinese resolve to become a key stakeholder in the Afghanistan end-game. While news of a Sino-Indian border conflict continues to pour in, the deteriorating relationship between the two regional powers will embody itself through conflict in Afghanistan.

There is little doubt that the Trump administration has sought to pressurise Pakistan by making India a stakeholder in Afghanistan and ignoring Pakistan's counter-terrorism efforts. Yet, even the deployment of additional troops will be unfruitful if Pakistan is excluded from any sustainable peace effort in the region.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Political science'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'White House'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Economics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AfPak', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'AfPak'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Proxy war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Federally Administered Tribal Areas'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Federally Administered Tribal Areas'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Department of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Aid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IsraeliâPalestinian_peace_process', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'IsraeliâPalestinian peace process'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Vladimir Putin'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'The Pentagon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Republican Party (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Regional power'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}]",https://c.tribune.com.pk/2017/08/1489443-AliRafi-1503511784-687-640x480.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.3725490196078431,241253460,1,tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,Foreign policy Terrorism United States Pakistan Afghanistan War on Terror Political science Donald Trump White House Economics Presidency of Donald Trump AfPak Proxy war Federally Administered Tribal Areas Government of Pakistan United States Department of State Aid Barack Obama India IsraeliâPalestinian peace process Vladimir Putin The Pentagon Presidency of Barack Obama Republican Party (United States) China Regional power Counter-terrorism,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,51,6,2017-08-24

President Donald Trump has chastised Pakistan for harboring ""agents of chaos"" and providing safe havens to militant groups waging an insurgency against a U.S.-backed government in Kabul, saying Islamabad must promptly change tack.

White House officials have gone further and threatened aid and military cuts, as well as other measures to force nuclear-armed Pakistan's hand and bring about an end to the 16-year-war.

Abbasi has not responded yet to Trump's remarks but Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Washington should not use Pakistan as a ""scapegoat"" for its failures in America's longest running war. Pakistan denies harboring militants.

As is often the case with Pakistan, the final decision about how to proceed with rest with the military, which has ruled the country for nearly half its 70-year history. It calls the shots on key parts of Pakistan's foreign policy, including ties with the United States, Afghanistan and arch-foe India.

Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who will be part of the National Security Council meeting on Thursday, a day earlier met with U.S. Ambassador David Hale and said Islamabad wanted trust and understanding rather than U.S. aid money.

Pakistani officials bristle at what they say is a lack of respect by Washington for the country's sacrifices in the war against militancy and its successes against groups like al Qaeda, Islamic State or the Pakistani Taliban.

Pakistan estimates there have been 70,000 casualties in militant attacks since it joined the U.S. ""war on terrorism"" after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

""We feel the American administration led by Mr Trump has been totally one sided, unfair to Pakistan and does not appreciate and recognize Pakistan has been a pivotal player...in the campaign against terrorism,"" Senator Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the senate defense committee, told Reuters on Thursday.

Pakistani officials have also been angered by Trump imploring old rival India to play a greater role in reconstructing Afghanistan, warning a greater Indian role in Kabul could be a threat to regional peace.

Pakistan fears New Delhi's greater influence in Afghanistan would leave it sandwiched by India, its bigger neighbor against whom it has fought three wars since independence in 1947.

Analysts have also warned putting greater pressure on Pakistan risks driving Islamabad deeper into the arms of China, its northern neighbor which is investing nearly $60 billion in infrastructure projects as part of its Belt and Road initiative.

China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call the United States must value Pakistan's role in Afghanistan and respect its security concerns, according to Chinese state media.

""Things have changed since 9/11,"" added Hussain.

""The U.S. today has far more diminished clout and leverage in the region and we have far more strategic space and options in our foreign policy.""

The relationship between the two countries has endured periods of extreme strain in recent years, especially after al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. special forces in Pakistan in a 2011 raid. -- Reuters","[{'uri': 'asim_malik@aaj.tv', 'name': 'Asim Malik', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type':

President Donald Trump has chastised Pakistan for harboring ""agents of chaos"" and providing safe havens to militant groups waging an insurgency against a US-backed government in Kabul, saying Islamabad must promptly change tack.

White House officials have gone further and threatened aid and military cuts, as well as other measures to force Pakistan's hand and bring about an end to the 16-year-war.

The prime minister has not responded yet to Trump's remarks but Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Washington should not use Pakistan as a 'scapegoat' for its failures in America's longest running war. Pakistan denies harboring militants.

In dealing with Trump, Pakistan plays its trump card

As is often the case with Pakistan, the final decision about how to proceed rests with the military, which has ruled the country for nearly half its 70-year history. It calls the shots on key parts of the country's foreign policy, including ties with the United States, Afghanistan and arch-foe India.

Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who will be part of the National Security Council (NSC) meeting on Thursday, a day earlier met with US Ambassador David Hale and said Islamabad wanted trust and understanding rather than US aid money.

Government officials bristle at what they say is a lack of respect by Washington for the country's sacrifices in the war against militancy and its successes against groups like al Qaeda, Islamic State or the Pakistani Taliban.

According to official estimates, there have been 70,000 casualties in militant attacks since it joined the US ""war on terrorism"" after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. ""We feel the American administration led by Trump has been totally one sided, unfair to Pakistan and does not appreciate and recognise Pakistan has been a pivotal player...in the campaign against terrorism,"" Senator Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the Senate defense committee, told Reuters on Thursday.

China defends Pakistan after Trump criticism

Officials have also been angered by Trump imploring old rival India to play a greater role in reconstructing Afghanistan, warning a greater Indian role in Kabul could be a threat to regional peace. Islamabad fears New Delhi's greater influence in Afghanistan would leave it sandwiched by India.

Analysts have also warned putting greater pressure on Pakistan risks driving Islamabad deeper into the arms of China, which is investing nearly $60 billion in infrastructure projects as part of its Belt and Road initiative.

China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call the United States must value Pakistan's role in Afghanistan and respect its security concerns, according to Chinese state media.

""Things have changed since 9/11,"" added Hussain. ""The US today has far more diminished clout and leverage in the region and we have far more strategic space and options in our foreign policy.""

Politicians react to Trump's remarks against Pakistan over Afghan policy

The relationship between the two countries has endured periods of extreme strain in recent years, especially after al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by US special forces in Pakistan in a 2011 raid.","[{'uri': 'reuters@tribune.com.pk', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type':

Meeting of the National Security committee will be chaired by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi around 11 am.

Senior civil and military officials, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff committee, services chiefs, and ministers of defence, interior, foreign affairs and finance will attend the meeting.

Moreover, Foreign office's weekly press briefing was postponed until tomorrow.

This will be the second NSC meeting of the newly elected Prime minister Khaqan Abbasi since taking charge. Prime minister chaired his first meeting on August 16 and focused on Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir, unprovoked cross-border firing and killings after Independence Day celebrations were held in the occupied valley.

Abbasi went to Saudi Arabia for a day-long visit yesterday after Trump's policy speech, and held a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

Trump in his speech announced a strategy for the region on Tuesday and harshly criticized Pakistan for providing ""safe haven"" to the terrorist and agent of chaos.

Trump paved the way for the deployment of thousands more US troops to Afghanistan, backtracking from his promise to rapidly end America's longest war, while pillorying ally Pakistan.

David Hale US Ambassador to Pakistan called on Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa at the GHQ, according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) yesterday.

Ambassador Hale said that US values Pakistan's role in war against terror and seeks cooperation from Pakistan to resolve Afghan issue.

Army Chief laid emphasis that peace in Afghanistan is important for Pakistan and Pakistan has done a lot towards that end and shall keep on doing its best; not to appease anyone but in line with Pakistan's national interest and national policy.

Gen Bajwa said that Pakistan is not looking for any material or financial assistance from the United States but rather trust, understanding and acknowledgment of its contributions.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Prime Minister of Pakistan'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Abbasid Caliphate'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Independence Day (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kashmir'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Saudi Arabia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Saudi Arabia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_bin_Salman', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Mohammad bin Salman'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Javed_Bajwa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Qamar Javed Bajwa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Headquarters_(Pakistan_Army)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hale_(diplomat)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'David Hale (diplomat)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Ambassador to Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Inter-Services Public Relations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}]",http://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2017-08-24/national-security-meeting-to-be-held-today-1503558582-6821.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.0980392156862745,241256460,1,nation.com.pk,news,The Nation,Prime Minister of Pakistan Abbasid Caliphate Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Donald Trump Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Independence Day (United States) United States National Security Council Kashmir Saudi Arabia Pakistan India Mohammad bin Salman Qamar Javed Bajwa General Headquarters (Pakistan Army) David Hale (diplomat) United States Ambassador to Pakistan Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan) Inter-Services Public Relations War on Terror Terrorism United States Afghanistan,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,41,7,2017-08-24

""Pakistan's government has deployed 15,000 soldiers to ensure their safety and safeguard the corridor while the four provinces of Pakistan have their own assigned forces to protect Chinese citizens,"" he said in an interview.

He said that security situation had much improved in Pakistan, especially in the past two years when security offensives against terrorists had achieved a comprehensive victory.

""The new prime minister has expressed his support for the CPEC,"" Ambassador Khalid stressed and added, ""He is very clear about this.""

He also revealed striking figures would show the extent of China's investments in Pakistan and said, ""China pumped US$1.8 billion into Pakistan last year. However, if all the projects including those that have already started but have not been completed and those that have not kicked off yet are taken into account, China's investment in Pakistan exceeds US$ 50 billion.""

Ambassador Khalid said these investments were concentrated in energy and infrastructure industries.

However, the new trend is many smaller Chinese firms are also investing in Pakistan's textile and food processing sectors as the country boasts huge market potential in these areas.

He underlined that the friendship between the two countries went well beyond economic cooperation. ""Our friendship is true, time-tested friendship.""

""China offered timely assistance when Pakistan was hit by an earthquake in 2005, and Pakistan did so too when a tremor struck China's Sichuan province in 2008.""

There were many such examples, meaning Pakistan was ready to help at any time if China had difficulties, and vice versa, he added.

By announcing a shift in policy from its earlier 'Nation Building' approach to now out and out armed conflict with voices of dissent in Afghanistan, the US has flushed down the gutter the lives of its 2,300 soldier, 16 years of work and one trillion dollars spent on the 'Nation Building' policy.

Pakistani political leadership and military top brass need to sit together and make sure that the country doesn't face any embarrassing situation like the OBL debacle. These views were shared by defence and foreign policy experts at Jang Forum held in relevance with Donald Trump's recent criticism and allegations against Pakistan.

The panelists included former central Media Coordinator PML-N Muhammad Mahdi, former additional foreign secretary Nazir Hussain, Dean and Head of the Department Political Science University of Punjab Prof Dr Rasheed Ahmed Khan and Defence Strategy Expert Air Vice Marshal (Retd) Anwar Mahmood Khan. The forum was moderated by Moayyed Jafri.

Nazir Hussain said the statement by Trump regarding Pakistan can be broken down into three prongs. The first of which was his appreciation for the role Pakistan has played and the sacrifices laid by Pakistan in fighting terrorism, which is a welcome admission and acknowledgement coming from the American President. The second part is the allegation of terrorist sanctuaries, which ISPR had preemptively denied in the presser a day before Trump's speech and had offered third party verification to disprove that allegation, however, Washington apparently disagrees. The third part was India's role in the Indo-Pacific region and support for expansion of India's role and influence in the region.

The former additional foreign secretary said with these trends in mind, Pakistani strategists will need to ask themselves the age old questions, what is better for Pakistan's security and interests in the long term vis-Ã -vis Afghanistan, is it a Taliban coalition or Indian dominated controlled Western Border of Afghanistan.

He said Pakistan should send a strong message back to Washington and the best way to do that is through the platform of the parliament. Central Media Coordinator PML-N Muhammad Mahdi said that the American policy regarding Afghanistan is mostly CPEC-centric and how to safeguard the economic interests of its allies. He said: ""We should consider that the tone of foreign leaders when talking about a country depends heavily on what kind of leadership is present in the country. We must not forget that we have recently deposed a popular prime minister who had tow-third majority.""

He said Hussain Haqqani was among the team that prepared Trump's final policy statement over South Asia Pakistani political leadership and military top brass need to sit together and make sure that the country doesn't face any embarrassing situation like the OBL debacle, he said. We will need to trust our foreign office and every stakeholder will need to be on board to reach a policy stance over this.

Dean and Head of the Department Political Science University of Punjab Prof Dr Rasheed Ahmed Khan said the statement by the American president is the outburst of a leader outraged by his failures in Afghanistan. Policy shift by Washington should be a major concern for Pakistan because Trump's principal adviser has stated: ""The solution to Afghanistan is not in Afghanistan, but in Pakistan"". However, nothing drastic will ensue right after these statements. The US will most likely threaten Pakistan with drone strikes deep within our territory, he opined. Pakistan, he said, should not fall for the US pressure but should focus their own strategic and regional interests while crafting its policy.

Defense Strategy Expert Air Vice Marshal (Retd) Anwar Mahmood Khan said by announcing a shift in policy from its earlier 'Nation Building' approach to now out and out armed conflict with voices of dissent in Afghanistan, the US has flushed down the gutter the lives of its 2300 soldier, 16 years of work and one trillion dollars spent on the 'Nation Building' policy. He said this outburst also marks the failure of Pakistani lobbyists and foreign office in Washington. He said foreign policy is a reflection of internal policy and a country that acquired $ 35 billion debt in the past four years cannot hardly stand up to such statements.

He said Pakistan Army has arguably proven itself to be the most potent fighting force against terrorism as they are the only one to have defeated terrorism. He said it took Pakistan 70 years to mend fences with Afghanistan and it might take 70 more to do it again because of the rapidly convoluting geopolitical situation in this region. He was of the view that favoritism in appointments to foreign office and other key policymaking institutions need to end if we are actually serious about this situation.","[{'uri':

Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Committee Zubair Hayat, Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Air Chief ACM Sohail Aman, and Naval Chief Admiral Muhammad Zakaullah are among those in attendance.

The national security meeting on Thursday is being held with the agenda to come up with a combined response to President Trump's new stance regarding Afghanistan and South Asia in which he has singled out Pakistan for its alleged involvement in terrorism.

""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,"" he had said in his speech on August 21.

Trump has demanded that Pakistan should ""stop offering safe haven to agents of chaos"" as he presented his policy for the 16-year-long war in Afghanistan in his first formal address as the commander-in-chief.

While inviting India to provide more economic assistance and development to Afghanistan, Trump discarded his previous criticism of America's longest war as ""a waste of time and money"".

PM Abbasi has yet to respond to the shift in US stance.

On Wednesday, US Ambassador David Hale called on Gen Bajwa to brief him on the new South Asia policy of the US.

Responding to the invective, the army chief had said: ""We are not looking for any material or financial assistance from the US, but trust, understanding and [an] acknowledgement of our contributions.""

Earlier on Tuesday, the day after Trump's speech, Ambassador David Hale also met Khawaja Asif and told him that US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will discuss the bilateral relationship between the two countries and the US's South Asia policy in greater detail.

During the meeting, Asif had reiterated Pakistan's desire for peace in Afghanistan and told the ambassador that he had accepted the invitation extended to him by Tillerson last week and looked forward to interactions with Washington.

The same day, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had underlined the measures the Trump administration could take to prevent Pakistan from allegedly supporting the Afghan Taliban.

Tillerson had also reminded India of the need to ""take some steps of rapprochement"" for improving ties with Pakistan.

After Trump's allegations against Pakistan for allegedly harbouring terrorists, China and Saudi Arabia have come to the country's defence in separate statements and asked that the world acknowledge Pakistan's contribution in the fight against terrorism.

After a meeting with PM Abbasi on Wednesday, Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman Al Saud acknowledged Pakistan's efforts and sacrifices in its resolute fight against terrorism.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying had asserted that Pakistan was on the front line in the struggle against terrorism and had made ""great sacrifices"" and ""important contributions"" in the fight.

Chunying called on the international community to recognise Pakistan's role in the fight against terrorism.","[{'uri': 'sanaullah_khan@dawn.com', 'name': 'Sanaullah Khan', 'type': 'author',

""We believe that it's ultimately a political solution that is obtained through diplomacy.""

Meanwhile, the US media continued to debate President Trump's new strategy on Afghanistan and South Asia as an opinion article in the New York Times cautioned that alienating Pakistan could make the situation in Afghanistan far worse.

When pressed to respond if the Secretary was linking a solution on Kashmir with Pakistan-Afghanistan issue, Nauert said that the United States viewed the whole strategy and handling Afghanistan as being a regional strategy which included India as well as Pakistan.

Asked if U.S. support Pakistan efforts to put a fence or a wall along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, she said that the US haven't had conversation with the Pakistani government about that proposal.

She said that on Kashmir, the United States continue to encourage the sides to sit down and talks together about that.

Speaking about the militant groups and regional approach to the US efforts for peace and stability at a briefing on Tuesday, Secretary Tillerson said that India and Pakistan had their own issues that they had to continue to work through.

""But I think there are areas where perhaps even India can take some steps of rapprochement on issues with Pakistan to improve the stability within Pakistan and remove some of the reasons why they deal with these unstable elements inside their own country,"" he went on to say.

""One of the things that we would do is ask or encourage India and Pakistan to sit down together and engage in direct dialogue that is aimed at reducing tensions between both of those countries,"" said US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert at a press briefing, when asked to comment on Tillerson's remarks.

President Trump in his speech made an oft-repeated remarks against Pakistan of providing safe havens to some militant groups, allegations Pakistan has already rejected.

Commenting on threats that US could severe aid to Pakistan, the NYT report said that American Policy-makers have repeatedly considered and rejected that possibility before. ""Pakistan also has a powerful ally in China, which is likely to step into any breach in American assistance. Alienating Pakistan could make the situation in Afghanistan far worse,"" the NYT article said.

A separate NYT opinion article observed that President Trump's invitation to India ""to help us more with Afghanistan"" would certain to bring an adverse reaction from Pakistan and would enrage its military.

Top US officials at a briefing on Wednesday at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) repeated several times that US considers Pakistan an ""important partner"" that shares many common interests and enemies.

It has been conveyed to the US administration through diplomatic channels that Pakistan will set its strategy for a peaceful Afghanistan in view of its national security policy, sources told Daily Express.

The civil and military leadership has expressed serious reservations over the new US policy on Afghanistan.

""Consultations at the highest levels concluded that Pakistan will not give in to any American pressure or demands,"" sources said, adding that senior federal authorities have voiced .It has been conveyed to the Trump administration that Pakistan has achieved 100% results in its military operations against terrorists of all hue and colour and will continue doing so until the last terrorist is eliminated.

According to sources, Pakistan has told US Ambassador David Hale that neither was Islamabad dependent on Washington for its defence system nor did its economy need American financial assistance.

They said that Pakistan had started approaching its allies, including China, Russia and other countries to muster support in the face of the new US policy. Beijing has assured Islamabad that it will veto any possible resolution in the UN Security Council by the US.

Sources also said that Islamabad has set its own strategy to deal with the new US strategy. Pakistan, they said, has warned the US of possible pull-out from the Afghan reconciliation process if Washington didn't change its approach.

""If the US adopts a balanced policy, Pakistan will also establish good relations with the Trump administration, otherwise Pakistan can review its relations on all issues,"" they added.

According to an important source, the US administration has started discussions on the policy in light of Pakistan's reaction.

Foreign Minister Khawja Asif's visit to the US will be vital in the context as the minister has been tasked to state Pakistan's stance to the Trump administration.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had earlier this month invited Asif to Washington. The invitation was extended by the secretary of state during a telephone conversation with Asif.

Reciprocating the gesture, Asif also extended an invitation to Secretary Tillerson to visit Pakistan. Tillerson, according to the Foreign Office, accepted the invitation.

Sources said the federal government would set its policy at the National Security Committee meeting today (Thursday).",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'National security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Veto'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Beijing'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Beijing'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}]",http://pakobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1489586-tal-1503519014-273-640x480.jpg,eng-3382459,0.1294117647058823,241266120,1,pakobserver.net,news,Pakistan Observer,"Presidency of Donald Trump Islamabad United States Pakistan Afghanistan Terrorism Karachi National security Federal government of the United States Washington, D.C.

The contours of Pakistan-US relations in the Trump era are beginning to take shape with the announcement of the US president's new Afghan policy. His praise for India and harsh words for Pakistan, particularly the accusation that we are providing safe havens to terrorist organisations, indicate that the US is going to take a tough line with Pakistan without any of the sugarcoating of his predecessors. From Khawaja Asif's statement that Pakistan should not be made a 'scapegoat' for the American failures in Afghanistan to the Foreign Office expressing disappointment and pointing out the tremendous losses faced by Pakistan in our fight against terrorism to Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa telling the US ambassador that Pakistan wants trust and acknowledgement of its sacrifices more than any kind of financial assistance, the response from Pakistan has been measured and calm - but firm. While it is becoming clear that the US is planning on changing its approach to Pakistan, we do not yet know what form that will take. The Trump administration itself has sent out rather mixed signals. US National Security Council spokesperson Michael Anton made the implied threats in Trump's speech explicit when he said the president had put Pakistan ""on notice"". Anton went as far as to say that the US reserves the right not just to impose sanctions on militant groups like the Haqqani Network but any Pakistani officials who may be tied to these groups. At the same time, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took a more conciliatory tone. While emphasising that sanctions may be on the table and that Pakistan could lose its special status as a major non-Nato ally, Tillerson at least recognised the price Pakistan has paid for fighting the war on militancy.

It will take some time to find out if the US intends to follow through on its threats but its words alone have the power to seriously affect relations between the two countries. In Pakistan, the reaction to the Trump speech from the political class has been one of anger. We are less inclined than ever to view the US as an honest broker for peace in the region, especially given how Trump pointedly and deliberately followed criticism of Pakistan with supportive words for India. Once the US sends more troops to Afghanistan, we can also expect a corresponding increase in drone attacks and other covert operations. The US is still open to the possibility that it will need to eventually negotiate with the Taliban and knows that Pakistan is needed for that so a complete break in ties is unlikely. But it has undoubtedly decided to take a more confrontational line with Pakistan, making it more difficult for us to work with the Afghan government and sowing doubt about US intentions. Analysts have conjectured that Pakistan may be left with no options but to side with China in a wider global struggle while Indian lines up with Washington. However, government spokespersons have strongly affirmed they will continue the process of continuing talking to Washington. One thing is clear, though: the US is making one last push to try and win what is essentially an unwinnable war and in doing so it seems ready to push aside allies if it thinks that will help its effort.","[{'uri': 'ocour_correspondents@thenews.com.pk', 'name': 'OCour Correspondents', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_News_International', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'The News International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Javed_Bajwa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Qamar Javed Bajwa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Economic sanctions'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Drone strikes in Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}]",http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheNewsInternational-Editorial/~4/3S0YnjF1_Co,eng-3382459,-0.1058823529411764,241275240,1,thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,"United States Pakistan Afghanistan The News International Terrorism Presidency of Donald Trump Qamar Javed Bajwa Rex Tillerson United States National Security Council Foreign and Commonwealth Office Economic sanctions India Drone strikes in Pakistan Taliban United States Secretary of State Politics of Afghanistan Washington, D.C.

Pakistan, the committee observed, had to manage the blowback of a protracted conflict in Afghanistan that resulted in deluge of refugees, flow of drugs and arms and more recently, in the shape of terrorists' safe havens in eastern Afghanistan, where terrorist groups continue to operate and launch attacks inside Pakistan.

""We would like to see effective and immediate US military efforts to eliminate sanctuaries harbouring terrorists and miscreants on the Afghan soil, including those responsible for fomenting terror in Pakistan,"" those in attendance stressed. ""Afghan war cannot be fought in Pakistan.""

On its own part, the statement added, Pakistan has taken indiscriminate actions against all terrorist networks and sacrificed tens of thousands of troops and civilians in this fight. ""The demonstrated security improvement inside Pakistan would not have been possible without eliminating all terrorist hideouts.""

The committee stressed that instead of any financial or material assistance, there should be an understanding and recognition of Pakistan's efforts, contributions and sacrifice of thousands of Pakistanis and over $120 billion of economic losses.

""We consider the lives of the citizens of other countries as sacrosanct as those of our own,"" the participants said. ""Pakistan is committed to not allowing its soil to be used for violence against any other country.""

""We expect the same from our neighbours,"" the participants were quoted as saying.

The committee observed that a prolonged military campaign in Afghanistan had resulted in the destruction and killings of hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians.

The participants asserted that India cannot be a ""net security provider"" in South Asia when it has conflicting relationships with all its neighbours, and is pursuing a policy of destabilising Pakistan from the East and the West.

The committee in its meeting held here with Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in chair rejected the specific allegations and insinuations made against Pakistan.

Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif and high-ranking military officials briefed the meeting on the Trump's policy and future strategy for the region.

The committee said that Pakistan had to manage the blowback of a protracted conflict in Afghanistan that resulted in deluge of refugees, flow of drugs and arms and more recently in the shape of terrorist safe havens in eastern Afghanistan from where anti-Pakistan terrorist groups continue to operate and launch attacks inside Pakistan.

The fact, it said, remains that the complex issues and internal dynamics inside Afghanistan pose a grave challenge not only to Pakistan but to the broader region and the international community.

While noting the US commitment to continue to shoulder the burden of Afghanistan and reverse the expanding ungoverned spaces in the country, the committee observed that Pakistan had consistently supported all international efforts for a stable and peaceful Afghanistan and has also committed more than a billion dollars for infrastructure and social development in that country.

Over the years, Pakistan has worked with both the United States and Afghanistan to promote peace through a politically negotiated outcome which, in Pakistan's view, remains the best option to bring stability to this war torn country.

A prolonged military campaign in Afghanistan has resulted in destruction and killing of hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians.

Pakistan has also endorsed and supported all Afghan owned and Afghan led initiatives for peace.

It is Pakistan's expectation that any strategy adopted to stabilize Afghanistan will succeed to end this protracted conflict and usher in an era of peace in the country paving way for the dignified return of millions of Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan for which we are willing to extend all possible cooperation.

""More specifically, we would like to see effective and immediate US military efforts to eliminate sanctuaries harboring terrorists and miscreants on the Afghan soil including those responsible for fomenting terror in Pakistan. The Afghan war cannot be fought in Pakistan,"" it added.

The committee stressed that instead of any financial or material assistance, there should be understanding and recognition of our efforts, contributions and sacrifice of thousands of Pakistanis and over 120 billion dollars of economic losses.

""We consider the lives of the citizens of other countries as sacred as those of our own and, therefore, Pakistan is committed to not allowing its soil to be used for violence against any other country. We expect the same from our neighbours,"" the committee said.

It said the claims of billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan are also misleading to the extent that the reimbursements to Pakistan since 2001 only account for part of the cost of ground facilities and air corridors used by the United States for its operations in Afghanistan, rather than any financial aid or assistance.

Pakistan's effective counter-terrorism operations have clearly proved that tide of terrorism can be reversed and we are willing to share our experience with both the US and Afghanistan.

This would require working together and focusing on core issues of eliminating safe havens inside Afghanistan, border management, return of refugees and reinvigorating the peace process for a political settlement in Afghanistan.

The committee stressed that India cannot be a net security provider in the South Asia region when it has conflictual relationships with all its neighbours and is pursuing a policy of destabilizing Pakistan from the east and the west.

The committee expressed deep concern at Indian policies inimical to peace in the region including interference in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries and using terrorism as an instrument of state policy.

It condemned state inflicted repression on the people of Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) and reiterated Pakistan's continued diplomatic, political and moral support for their struggle for self determination.

It reaffirmed Pakistan's resolve to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The committee underscored that as a responsible Nuclear weapon state, Pakistan has in place a robust and credible command and control system which has been universally recognized and appreciated.

Pakistan will continue to extend all possible cooperation to the international community for achieving the common objectives of peace and stability in Afghanistan and in the broader region, it concluded.","[{'uri': 'associated_press@nation.com.pk', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Illegal drug trade'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Infrastructure'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_refugees', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan refugees'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IsraeliâPalestinian_peace_process', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'IsraeliâPalestinian peace process'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Self-determination'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kashmir'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear weapon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereignty'}}]",http://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2017-08-24/no-safe-havens-for-terrorists-in-pakistan-nsc-rejects-trump-s-remarks-1503584999-2475.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.1764705882352942,241281900,1,nation.com.pk,news,The Nation,United States National Security Council Terrorism Pakistan Afghanistan Donald Trump Khawaja Muhammad Asif Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Illegal drug trade Refugee International community South Asia Foreign minister Infrastructure Afghan refugees IsraeliâPalestinian peace process Counter-terrorism United States Armed Forces India Self-determination Kashmir Nuclear weapon Sovereignty,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,45,14,2017-08-24

Truman is said to have asked the Pakistani PM: 'Do you do?'

The Pakistani PM replied: 'Of course we do.'

Truman then said, 'Done,' and a friendship was struck between the two countries.

On his return to Pakistan, the PM briefed his cabinet about his meeting with the US President, saying: 'to maintain our relations with the US we will have to do stuff.'

When a minister asked what kind of stuff, the PM replied: 'You know, stuff like keeping the communists out, promoting democracy and setting up Coca Cola factories in Pakistan.' It was this last bit which finally made the cabinet members agree to just do it.

From 1952 onward the US began to supply economic and military aid to Pakistan.

Relations between the two nations continued to grow when in 1956, the then US President, Duckworth-Lewis Eisenhower, asked Pakistan to do and a very important do.

'Of course, how can we not do the do?' replied the then PM of Pakistan whose name has been lost to history because there were so many Pakistani PMs in the 1950s.

The 'important do' in this case was to allow the US to set up an air base in Peshawar from where the US spy planes could fly over the Soviet Union and see if the Soviets were developing a better and fizzier version of Coca Cola.

The air base was still functional when Air Water Field Marshall Sharbat Gul became President of Pakistan in 1959. The US Air Force plane which was shot over the Soviet Union in 1960 had taken off from this base. The pilot of the plane, Lieutenant Tom Cruise, is reported to have spotted a cola factory near Moscow when his plane was shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air -- then-back-to-surface missile.

The US pilot whose plane flew from Peshawar and was shot down over Soviet Union in 1960.

In 1964 the US doubled its economic and military aid to Pakistan and also promised that it would share with the Pakistani scientists the secret Coke formula if Pakistan continued to do stuff. When the Indian intelligence agency RAWT managed to get hold of this information, the Indian Prime Minister Sri Chandan MohanPapaya, ordered his country's armed forces to attack the Pakistani city of Lahore.

President Sharbat Gul asked the US to do for Pakistan what Pakistan had being doing for the US. But to Pakistan's surprise, the US did not provide Pakistan with the military support that it had pledged. Many believed that a plot was being hatched to dismember Pakistan with the help of India, Israel and maybe even Iceland.

In a statement released by the White House, US President Lyndon B. Johnson & Jonson said: 'The US has always desired peace in the Middle East.' When he was told that Pakistan and India were not in the Middle East but South Asia, Johnson & Johnson said, 'well, there was already a war going on in the South Asian country of Vietnam.' When told that Vietnam was in South East Asia and not South Asia, Johnson & Johnson said that he was misled by his 4 grade geography teacher, Mrs. Patricia Wood, who he now believed might have been a communist spy.

After the 1965 war between Pakistan and India ended in a stalemate, relations between the US and Pakistan began to nosedive. However, relations between the two countries improved when Sharbat Gul resigned and handed over power to Gen Kublai Khan. In 1971, the new Pakistani leader facilitated US President John Wayne's historical visit to a Chinese restaurant in Karachi.

This was the beginnings of the thawing of relations between the US and communist China which hated communist Soviet Union just like capitalist US did which hated communism in general but was now kind of okay with Chinese communism.

Gen Kublai was a tad confused by the maneuver but he did say that he enjoyed the chicken corn soup at the restaurant a lot.

Nevertheless, in 1971, when a civil war erupted in Pakistan's eastern wing India entered the fray triggering another war between the two countries. Gen Kublia sent an urgent message to President Wayne: 'Do?'

The US President replied: 'No can do.'

The US refused to lift the arms embargo. By now, a majority of Pakistanis were convinced that indeed a plan was afoot to dismantle Pakistan with the help of India, Israel, Iceland, and maybe even Ireland.

Pakistan's president issued a short but strongly worded statement against the embargo. In it he stated: 'This is a strongly worded statement against the US arms embargo.""

The White House was quick to respond. US President John Wayne assured Khan that the US remained to be a strong ally of Pakistan and saw its existence as vital for the stability of the East African region.When told that Pakistan was in South Asia and not East Africa, President Wayne asked, 'how come nobody tells me these things?'

It turned out that his 4 grade geography teacherwas also Mrs. Patricia Wood.

Mrs. Patricia Wood who taught geography to two future US presidents. Both went on to believe that she might have been a Soviet spy.

Relations between the US and Pakistan remained somewhat steady during the populist regime of Prime Minister Mao Tse Bhutto in the 1970s. Pakistan did not do much and the US didn't ask it to do much. This is exactly what President Wayne's Secretary of State Henry Bukowski wrote in his book, Much Ado About Nothing.

But things in this respect began to change again when Democratic Party candidate, Jeramiah Corny Carter won the 1977 US Presidential election. The US intelligence agency, the CAIO, briefed him, suggesting that Bhutto was planning to nationalize all Coke factories in Pakistan and maybe even making a stronger, fizzier cola.

In a brief message to Bhutto, President Corny Carter wrote: 'Don't do.'

In an equally brief reply, Bhutto wrote: 'Don't do what?'

But before Carter could write back, Bhutto's regime was toppled by Gen Nasimul Hijazi. Then in 1979, Soviet troops invaded the Maldives.

In 1980 when Ronald McDonald replaced Carter as President, he asked Gen Hijazi 'to do stuff.' Hijazi complied because he saw the Soviets the same way President Ronald McDonald did i.e. as evil people who didn't believe in Santa.

In 1981, Pakistan and the United States agreed on a $3.2 billion military and economic assistance program aimed at helping Pakistan deal with the Soviets in the Maldives. President Ronald McDonald hoped that the US and Pakistan could work together to once and for all eradicate the communist menace from the Australasia region. When told that Pakistan was in South Asia, the President remarked, 'but communism is everywhere.' He then added that the US will go to any length to save the sanctity of Santa.

Hijazi turned Pakistan into an entirely pious nation which also helped him make the country the launching pad for an equally pious insurgency against Soviet forces in the Maldives. The insurgency was largely funded by the US, Saudi Arabia and Santa Clause. It was navigated by the Hijazi regime in Pakistan. It was all very groovy.

In a personal message to President Hijazi, President Ronald McDonald said: 'Doing awesome.'

Hijazi replied: 'We can do more.'

To which President McDonald responded: 'Please do, please do.'

However, in the late 1980s, when the insurgency became a stalemate, the US asked Pakistan to 'do peace.' Hijazi was livid: 'But we can still do more.'

'Nothing doing,' the US insisted.

After the insurgency ended in 1989 and Soviet troops quit the Maldives and democracy returned to Pakistan and all kinds of nuts began trying to form a government in the Maldives, the US completely disengaged itself from the region. Its message to Pakistan: 'Now do whatever you want to do with it.'

In 1998 relations between the US and Pakistan hit rock-bottom when Pakistan tasted its own indigenous cola. India had done the same. Coco Cola and Pepsi protested and US President Fleetwood Mac imposed severe economic sanctions on Pakistan.

Prior to the tragic 9/11 attacks in New York, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were key supporters of the Teletubbies in the Maldives. The Teletubbies are a large group of herdsmen who were convinced that goats were more valuable than women. By 1996, they were ruling the Maldives.

Rise of the terrorism and new US President W G. Grace's wish to bomb everything that moved made the US bring Pakistan back into its do-orbit. The new Pakistani President Gen Matiullah Abideen received a call from US President WG Grace. The transcript of the phone call was recently leaked by the National Geographic:

In June 2004, President Grace designated Pakistan as a major ally. The US began dishing out millions of dollars' worth of economic and military aid. In a message to Pakistanis, President Grace said: 'Doing awesome, dudes. Keep doing.'

The Pakistanis replied by setting fire to US flags and hailing the Teletubies as the true saviors of their pious nation.

But by 2008 US was accusing Pakistan of playing a double game. It believed that Pakistan wasn't doing enough to go after the Teletubies. New US President Denzel Washington asked the new Pakistani President and PM and military chief to 'do more.'

'We are doing' Pakistan kept on saying, but the US continued to ask for more: 'Dil Mangey Aur, dil mangey aur,Dil mangey aur ...'

All the while the Teletubbies got bigger, fatter and badder. Until the concerned Americans elected a decisive man as their new President: Don Hump.

While Pakistani analysts believe that Trumps policy is old wine in new a bottle and Pakistani authorities have shown great displeasure as Trump did not acknowledge Pakistan's sacrifices in the War on Terror. Over the last two days China and Russia have come out openly against Trump's policy and spoken in favor of Pakistan; they have also advised US to reconsider this policy as it is in no one's interest or benefit.

Former Foreign Minister of Pakistan Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri talking to The Nation on this issue apart from giving his views about the line of action US plans to take, also shed light on absence of a foreign minister in Pakistan for four years thus did not present or fight its case at any forum. Regarding Trump's policy he said, ""President Donald Trump's statement and language that he used was totally inappropriate for diplomacy.""

Explaining how nothing significant was presented in the policy Kasuri explained, ""For months the US was giving indications that things would radically change after this policy review; but (it seems) they were making a mountain out of a molehill. The only two new things in the policy are, one they did not define when they would leave Afghanistan, secondly once the US 'wins' the war then they would bring the Taliban on the table. This was a very shallow statement.""

The US army re-centered Afghanistan after 9/11, earlier they were here providing material assistance during the Afghan jihad. Since then a war has been going on killing thousands of people in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Former FM said, ""They do not realize the outfall they [US Army] and Afghanistan would have to face after these statements. Earlier such a huge US army was deployed in Afghanistan but it could not make a difference, then how can things change by pumping in a couple of thousand more soldiers. The only thing that would happen is, Taliban would start killing the US Army and (number of) Afghan civilian deaths would increase. Even a man like Hamid Karzai as President of Afghanistan had to tell the US that it should stop their interference in the country as many deaths took place during his tenure.""

After Trump's statement China and Russia showed their annoyance and said that the US should review the new policy to maintain stability and peace in the region. Mr. Khursheed Kasuri was confident of Pakistan China friendship and said, ""If US thinks that these statements and steps will make China abandon Pakistan, that's not true. America should know that Pakistan will not compromise on two things no matter which government is in Power, one we [China, Pakistan] will not let go of our Nuclear program, so they should forget that they can intimidate us or pressurize us on this, and secondly on our sovereignty.""

Trump in his speech had criticized Pakistan for providing safe heavens to terrorists and said that if things did not change then US will attack at its one time and place anywhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan. Khursheed Kasuri responded to Trump's criticism by saying, ""Earlier America had an option of Northern District Network but that also ended with Russia. Has the US forgotten what Pakistan did with Northern Atlantic Trade Organization transit facility after the Salala attack? With such statements and tactics does the US think they can get away with it? This time the Pakistani public would react and even the Government would not be able to do anything because the Pakistani people have paid a very heavy price for this war.""

Since the PML (N) government came to power in 2013 Pakistan did not have a regular Foreign Minister which portfolio was kept by the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Sartaj Aziz and Tariq Fatimi where appointed advisers to Prime Minister, due to this situation Pakistan could not present its case at any forum nor lobby against its enemies (since the PM was not able to devote his full attention to Foreign policy affairs). Kasuri said ""for four years we did not have a proactive foreign office. It was totally neglected and there was no leadership. Everyone knew that the US was preparing a new policy yet we did not lobby our cause. However it is still not late and we must undertake three things 1) lobby in the political arena, 2) civil-military leadership should be on one page and take China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Britain on board as they are our old friends, especially as the British know this area better than the American; and 3) if US tries to step a foot in Pakistan it should be aware that neither the Pakistan Army nor the Government would allow them to get away with it.""

The role of Pakistan in the war on terror has over the years been talked about both in negative and positive manners. While many at home said that we were fighting someone else's war, many sided with the importance of having an Afghanistan free from foreign and internal interference, as such the 'do more' mantra became the byline for leaders in Pakistan. The current scenario calls for a rethink of our foreign policy both regional and global in view of our interests and future alignments so that our welfare and security does not depend on others policies, but their policies driven by Pakistan's importance and standing in the region.","[{'uri': 'r_umaima_ahmed@nation.com.pk', 'name': 'R Umaima Ahmed', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khurshid_Mahmud_Kasuri', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SovietâAfghan_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'SovietâAfghan War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Minister of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nawaz Sharif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hamid Karzai'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomacy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Nation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistanis', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistanis'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sartaj_Aziz', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sartaj Aziz'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Muslim League (N)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereignty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Turkey'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Saudi Arabia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Saudi Arabia'}}}]",http://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2017-08-24/how-pakistan-should-handle-us-afghan-policy-ex-fm-khursheed-kasuri-1503593759-7551.jpg,eng-3382459,0.1843137254901961,241290000,1,nation.com.pk,news,The Nation,Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri Donald Trump Pakistan China Afghanistan Taliban South Asia Russia SovietâAfghan War Minister of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan) War on Terror Nawaz Sharif Hamid Karzai President of Afghanistan Diplomacy Foreign minister The Nation Pakistanis Sartaj Aziz Pakistan Muslim League (N) Foreign policy Sovereignty Terrorism United Kingdom Pakistan Army Turkey Saudi Arabia,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,0,17,2017-08-24

As Trump alleged Pakistan of providing safe havens to terrorists on Monday and asked for more support to smash out terrorism, its own rival Russia, now an ally of Pakistan has come to fend off the US allegations.

Russian Presidential Envoy to Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov while firing a broadside at the new Afghan war strategy-with more troops to remain on ground in war-torn country- commented that Islamabad was 'a key regional player to negotiate with.'

He also warned the Trump administration against ramping up pressure on Pakistan.

""Putting pressure [on Pakistan] may seriously destabilise the region-wide security situation and result in negative consequences for Afghanistan,"" Kabulov said in an interview with Russia's 'Afghanistan' daily.

Russia is not the first state to throw weight behind Pakistan in the wake of ruthless allegations as China also opted the same line and asked US to cooperate with Pakistan that was fighting war against terrorism from the front line and had rendered ""great sacrifices"".

Hours after Trump's 'threat' to Pakistan, a country that lost over 40000 lives to war against terrorism, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in a categorical statement asked US and Pakistan to cooerate on the basis of mutual respect.

The Monday's policy of Trump that sounded a bit harsh was deplored across Pakistan as the Foreign Office rejected allegations that Pakistan offered safe haven to ""agents of chaos"", saying ""the policy ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation"".",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envoy_(title)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Envoy (title)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"", 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ballistic missile'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}]",http://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Russia-Pakistan-Flags-768x544.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.7254901960784313,241290120,1,thefrontierpost.com,news,The Frontier Post,Donald Trump United States Russia Pakistan China Terrorism Afghanistan Envoy (title) Islamabad Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China War on Terror Ballistic missile Foreign and Commonwealth Office,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,24,2,17,2017-08-24

Trump's policy is in sharp contrast to his electoral promises of a complete disengagement from Afghanistan.

The US policy choices in Afghanistan were from bad (moderate troop surge to postpone the defeat) to worse (complete withdrawal precipitating immediate defeat) and Trump has opted for the former. While Trump's Afghan policy is a departure from his predecessor's approach in its boldness. But the broad parameters remain, more or less, the same. Apparently, the tone and tenor of the new policy is quite Clausewitzian as it seeks to combine the military, political and diplomatic components. However, in reality, it is only the military component that is preponderant.

The key features of Trump's Afghan policy operate on a condition-based approach instead of a calendar-driven policy. No more peace talks with the Taliban, holding Pakistan accountable for providing sanctuaries to the Afghan militant groups, working closely with India to stabilise Afghanistan and the deployments of an additional 4,000 US troops are the main elements of this policy. The addition of 4,000 troops will take the total number of foreign troops in Afghanistan to 15,000 (12,000 from the US and 3,000 from Nato) who will advise, assist and train the Afghan forces. Moreover, America's open-ended commitment to Kabul will ease some pressure on the embattled National Unity Government (NUG) of Ashraf Ghani.

The policy seems to be a compromise between Trump - who wanted a complete withdrawal - and his generals - who wanted to ramp up the war effort in Afghanistan. The policy lacks a clear articulation on how its various components will break the strategic deadlock in Afghanistan, stabilise the deteriorating security situation and improve the prospects for peace-building. It raises more questions instead of providing answers. For instance, it is not clear what outcomes the Trump administration aims to achieve in Afghanistan by implementing the new strategy.

Despite a more assertive tone and a muscular outlook, Trump's Afghan policy exposes Washington's policy paralysis, lack of imagination and viable political options. It guarantees neither a decisive victory nor military gains that are significant enough to force the Taliban to come to the negotiating table.

President Obama, more or less, did the same during the final months of his administration. Obama's original plan was to reduce the number of US troops in Afghanistan to 1,000 to protect the US Embassy in Kabul. But he twice modified the planned reduction on the advice of his military advisers to leave more troops in deployment.

Afghanistan needs intensified political and diplomatic efforts to explore a negotiated settlement of the conflict. Instead, Trump has further militarised the conflict, which is a recipe for endless war. From the strategic point of view, an indefinite commitment to a protracted and asymmetrical war is a poor policy choice.

A military strategy is employed to create favourable conditions, which could be exploited politically. However, it is unclear how this policy of militarisation will create a political opening. It's not rocket science to understand that 15,000 foreign troops will not be able to achieve what 150,000 Nato/Isaf forces could not achieve, barring a few tactical victories.

Trump's policy pronouncement is a clear indication that Washington is scaling down its commitment from stabilising Afghanistan to preventing a terrorist attack on US soil which originates from Afghanistan. The issue with this kind of muddled mindset is that preventing Afghanistan from turning into a fertile ground for terrorist groups requires nation-building, which the Trump administration is shying away from. Unfortunately, as long as the government in Kabul remains dysfunctional, the Taliban will remain a hard reality.

Ideally, an overall political strategy was required for Afghanistan that should have guided its military component, among others. Instead, Washington has outsourced the Afghan policy to Pentagon opting for a militarised policy that offers little hope for conflict resolution. At best, Trump's new Afghan policy will deny Taliban an outright military victory. At worst, it will further harden the Taliban's insurgent attacks and fuel fresh recruitment.

The Trump administration has taken an oversimplified, static view of a complicated, dynamic and fluid regional issue that has changed dramatically since his inauguration in January 2017. The Afghan Taliban has diversified the regional linkages, minimising their sole dependence on Pakistan.

Today, the Taliban have a working relationship with Iran and Russia and, to a lesser extent, with Beijing. Islamabad, Tehran and Moscow consider the continued US military presence in Afghanistan to be a threat to their security and detrimental to their regional interests. So, while the Trump administration has taken a tough line on Pakistan for providing sanctuaries to the Taliban, it has fallen short of pointing out the support for the latter from Russia and Iran.

Scapegoating Pakistan for its policy failures in Afghanistan will not ease the US predicament in Afghanistan. The buck certainly does not stop at Islamabad. It is rather ironic that with its less than half-hearted commitment, Washington expects Islamabad to do more while it is the former who needs to do more.

The hardline towards Pakistan is not going to change its Afghan policy. On the contrary, the increased Indian engagement in Afghanistan - as envisaged by Trump in his speech - will further strengthen Islamabad's threat perception and add to its strategic anxiety. Consequently, Islamabad will continue to pursue a policy that aims to minimise the Indian influence in Afghanistan to avoid strategic encirclement.

Unfortunately, the endgame in Afghanistan has become more uncertain, with no end in sight to America's longest war. With its new Afghan policy, the Trump administration can manage the conflict in Afghanistan but cannot resolve it. Consequently, the current status quo in Afghanistan is likely to persist. Notwithstanding recent battlefield gains, the Taliban will not win and Kabul will not lose, despite the breakdown of governance and the economic meltdown.

The dropping of biggest non-nuclear bomb on the Afghan mountains few months ago reflects the extent of failure American military campaigns have faced. On April 13, 2017, under the Trump's presidency the US military dropped a massive GBU-43 bomb known as the mother of all bombs (MOAB)in Afghanistan against Islamic State (IS) militants and targeted the series of caves used by the terror group.

The reason for dropping the largest bomb was to deliver a clear message to militant groups that the United States is determined to defeating ISIS and Taliban in Afghanistan. It was also meant as a message to Taliban and ISIS about the power of US weapons and the determination of the US support for the government of Ashraf Ghani. It was the policy of 'shock and awe' where the overwhelming use of power of the US indicated that US has prepared itself for the invasion of Iraq.

There is a magnanimous failure of the US in achieving any of its major objectives in Afghanistan even after spending almost 16 years in the country. It is obvious that the US cannot win the war against the Taliban. We thought that using the deadly power of the MOAB could be a game changer but it doesn't leave any big foot prints.

Trump's new Afghan strategy aims at increasing the troops in Afghanistan which is a clear indication that this is the war is not going to end anytime soon. There are already about 8,500 US military troops in Afghanistan. The American President went against what he had previously said during the election campaign when he claimed the mission in Afghanistan was a waste of US efforts and vowed to pull troops out.

This was not the first time if we look back in history where it was suspected that Osama bin Laden was hiding in Afghanistan. The US military destroyed the caves by dropping 5,000-pound bunker busters on the Tora Bora Mountains.

Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the bombing in Afghanistan in a series of tweets. He says, ""I strongly condemn the dropping of the largest non-nuclear bomb, the latest destruction weapon, on the Afghanistan by US military. I don't consider it the war on terror, but the inhuman and most cruel misuse of Afghan ground. Now, it is upon us, Afghans, to stop the United States of America.""

The reality is that the world powers try to use the Afghan ground for their own interest and no one wants to help the Afghans rebuild their nation

The Afghan ground should not be a proxy battleground for external power and the government should keep a balance in its foreign policy. The reality is that the world powers try to use the Afghan ground for their own interest and no one wants to help the Afghans rebuild their nation. Hence, Afghanistan has become one of the poorest nations in the world.

The fact is, it is still Afghanistan on the map, but it is an uncontrolled land ruled by a bunch of different warlords, including the Taliban who controlled the south. Any sustainable solution can bring peace, comfort and dignity to the Afghan people. There are Millions of Afghans, who have given up and fled, turning up as refugees in other countries including Pakistan, Iran or Europe.

A western-style government in Afghanistan is a dream. I don't see that as a reality at any point in the near future. However, the unfortunate reality is that airstrikes are possibly the best option -- and maybe the simplest one for the United States against ISIS, but it is not enough to defeat them. The US is failing in 'war on terror' in Afghanistan. No lasting solution to the problem of ISIS or Taliban is going to come simply through American troops or bombs. Negotiation is the way forward.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Warlord'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Proxy war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tora_Bora', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Tora Bora'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Hamid Karzai'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Osama bin Laden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Twitter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Europe'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}}}]",http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/d97fed28ee01c15ff00e7dad956b545a.jpg ,eng-3382459,-0.1764705882352942,241316340,1,dailytimes.com.pk,news,Daily Times,Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Taliban United States Armed Forces United States Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani Warlord Proxy war Tora Bora War on Terror Hamid Karzai President of Afghanistan Osama bin Laden Foreign policy Twitter Demographics of Afghanistan Refugee Airstrike Europe Pakistan Iran,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,19,0,2017-08-25

The National Security Committee (NSC) made Islamabad's position known in a four-hour huddle at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) chaired by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. Abbasi returned about midnight from a whirlwind visit of Saudi Arabia.

The extensive statement on the nation's resolve issued at the conclusion of the NSC meeting was also read out in the Senate by Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif as a policy statement. The committee discussed the US administration's South Asia strategy at length following Donald Trump's remarks in which he accused Pakistan of harbouring terrorists through its ""safe havens"".

It was observed that scapegoating Pakistan will not help in stabilising Afghanistan. In fact, being its immediate neighbor, Pakistan has an abiding interest in peace and stability in Afghanistan.

The committee observed that Pakistan had to manage the blowback of a protracted conflict in Afghanistan that resulted in deluge of refugees, flow of drugs and arms and more recently in the shape of terrorist safe havens in eastern Afghanistan from where anti-Pakistan terrorist groups continue to operate and launch attacks inside Pakistan.

The fact remains that complex issues and internal dynamics inside Afghanistan pose a grave challenge not only to Pakistan, but also to the broader region and the international community.

Noting the US commitment to continue to shoulder the burden of Afghanistan and reverse the expanding ungoverned spaces in the country, the committee observed that Pakistan had consistently supported all international efforts for a stable and peaceful Afghanistan besides committing more than $1 billion dollars for infrastructure and social development in that country.

The committee was of the view that over the years, Pakistan had worked with both the United States and Afghanistan to promote peace through a politically-negotiated outcome which, in Pakistan's view, remains the best option to bring stability to this war-torn country.

A prolonged military campaign in Afghanistan has resulted in destruction and killing of hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians. Pakistan has also endorsed and supported all Afghan-owned and Afghan-led initiatives for peace.

It is Pakistan's expectation that any strategy adopted to stabilise Afghanistan will succeed to end this protracted conflict and usher in an era of peace in the country paving way for dignified return of millions of Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan for which it was willing to extend all possible cooperation.

More specifically, we would like to see effective and immediate US military efforts to eliminate sanctuaries harboring terrorists and miscreants on the Afghan soil including those responsible for fomenting terror in Pakistan.

The Afghan war cannot be fought in Pakistan. On its own part, Pakistan has taken indiscriminate actions against all terrorist networks and sacrificed tens of thousands of troops and civilians in this fight.

The demonstrated security improvement inside Pakistan would not have been possible without eliminating all terrorist hideouts. Moreover, successful cooperation with the US in the past against the common enemy, terrorism, reflects Pakistan's unflinching commitment to eliminate this menace.

The committee stressed that instead of any financial or material assistance, there should be an understanding and recognition of our efforts, contributions and sacrifice of thousands of Pakistanis and over $120 billion economic losses.

We consider the lives of the citizens of other countries as sacrosanct as those of our own and, therefore, Pakistan is committed to not allowing its soil to be used for violence against any other country.

We expect the same from our neighbours. The claims of billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan are also misleading to the extent that reimbursements to Pakistan since 2001 only account for part of the cost of ground facilities and air corridors used by the United States for its operations in Afghanistan, rather than any financial aid or assistance.

Pakistan's effective counter-terrorism operations have clearly proved that tide of terrorism can be reversed and we are willing to share our experience with both the US and Afghanistan.

This would require working together and focusing on core issues of eliminating safe havens inside Afghanistan, border management, return of refugees and reinvigorating the peace process for a political settlement in Afghanistan.

The committee stressed that India cannot be a net security provider in South Asia when it has conflictual relationships with all its neighbours and is pursuing a policy of destabilizing Pakistan from the east and the west.

The committee expressed deep concern over the Indian policies inimical to peace in the region including interference in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries and using terrorism as an instrument of state policy.

It condemned the state-inflicted repression on the people of Indian Held Kashmir (IHK) and reiterated Pakistan's continued diplomatic, political and moral support for their struggle for self-determination.

The committee reaffirmed Pakistan's resolve to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The committee underscored that as a responsible nuclear power, Pakistan had in place a robust and credible command and control system which has been universally recognized and appreciated.

Pakistan will continue to extend all possible cooperation to the international community for achieving the common objectives of peace and stability in Afghanistan and in the broader region.

Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi directed Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif to immediately undertake a visit to regional capitals to gain support in the aftermath of consequences for Pakistan in the recently announced US policy for Pakistan and South Asia.

Asif has already visited Saudi Arabia this week though details of the views of Washington's strong ally on Trump's policy and its fallout on Pakistan have not been made public by the government.

""Yes, visits by the foreign minister to Beijing and Moscow are very much on the cards but right now there are no dates for a meeting in Washington"", senior officials told The News. Asif will first undertake visit to Moscow. Amongst others Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani has asked Asif to cancel his visit to Washington.

The meeting was attended by federal ministers Engineer Khurram Dastagir Khan, Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee CJCSC) General Zubair Mahmood Hayat, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral Muhammad Zakaullah, Chief of Air Staff (CAS) Air Chief Marshal Sohail Aman, National Security Adviser (NSA) Lt. Gen (R) Nasser Khan Janjua, Director General ISI Lt. Gen. Naveed Mukhtar and senior civil and military officials.

Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif later told The News that he would be visiting the US next month and before that he would also visit Beijing and Moscow.

Agencies add: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Thursday called the new US strategy for Afghanistan regrettable, saying the blueprint unveiled by President Donald Trump was a ""futile course"".

Speaking at a press conference here, he said Russia had expressed ""regret that the main focus of the new (Afghanistan) strategy is regulation by methods of force.""

He said the new Afghan strategy was ""a dead end"". ""We are certain this is a futile course,"" he said, furthermore rejecting suggestions that Moscow was behind supplying the Taliban. ""ItÂ´s not the first time we are accused of supporting and even arming the Taliban,"" Lavrov said. ""Not one fact has been presented"" to support this.

Lavrov said Moscow only contacts the Taliban for two things: ensuring safety of Russian citizens in Afghanistan and pushing the Taliban to hold talks with the Afghan government.

ChinaÂ´s top diplomat defended PakistanÂ´s important role in Afghanistan in a phone call with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

China State Councillor Yang Jiechi told Tillerson Wednesday that ""we should attach importance to the important role that Pakistan plays in the Afghanistan issue, respect (PakistanÂ´s) sovereignty and legitimate security concerns,"" according to a foreign ministry statement.

It is the second time Beijing has defended its South Asian neighbour this week, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying praising Pakistan on Tuesday for making ""great sacrifices and contributions to fighting terrorism"".

The United States on Wednesday again urged India and Pakistan to engage in direct dialogue to reduce tension, a day after the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said India could take some steps of rapprochement on issues with Pakistan to improve stability.

Speaking about the militant groups and regional approach to the US efforts for peace and stability at a briefing on Tuesday, Secretary Tillerson said that India and Pakistan had their own issues that they had to continue to work through. ""But I think there are areas where perhaps even India can take some steps of rapprochement on issues with Pakistan to improve the stability within Pakistan and remove some of the reasons why they deal with these unstable elements inside their own country,"" he went on to say.

""One of the things that we would do is ask or encourage India and Pakistan to sit down together and engage in direct dialogue that is aimed at reducing tensions between both of those countries,"" said US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert at a press briefing, when asked to comment on Tillerson's remarks.

When pressed to respond if the secretary was linking a solution on Kashmir with Pakistan-Afghanistan issue, Nauert said that the US viewed the whole strategy and handling Afghanistan as being a regional strategy which included India as well as Pakistan. She said that on Kashmir, the US continued to encourage the sides to sit down and talk together about that.

Asked if US supports Pakistan efforts to put a fence or a wall along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, she said that the US hadn't had conversation with the Pakistani government about that proposal.

The spokesperson stated that the US did not believe that there was a long-term military ""fighting-it-out solution"" to peace in Afghanistan. ""We believe that it's ultimately a political solution that is obtained through diplomacy.""

Meanwhile, the US media continued to debate President Trump's new strategy on Afghanistan and South Asia as an opinion article in the New York Times cautioned that alienating Pakistan could make the situation in Afghanistan far worse. President Trump in his speech made an oft-repeated remarks against Pakistan of providing safe havens to some militant groups, allegations Pakistan has already rejected.

Commenting on threats that US could severe aid to Pakistan, the NYT report said that American Policy-makers have repeatedly considered and rejected that possibility before. ""Pakistan also has a powerful ally in China, which is likely to step into any breach in American assistance. Alienating Pakistan could make the situation in Afghanistan far worse,"" the NYT article said.

A separate NYT opinion article observed that President Trump's invitation to India ""to help us more with Afghanistan"" would certain to bring an adverse reaction from Pakistan and would enrage its military.

Top US officials at a briefing on Wednesday at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) repeated several times that US considers Pakistan an ""important partner"" that shares many common interests and enemies.

The officials spoke on the condition that they would not be identified, according to a report by the USIP posted on its website. They said that US recognises the sacrifices Pakistan has made in the fight against terrorism. ""The officials said they aim for a 'mature constructive relationship' with Pakistan,"" the USIP report said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Department of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kashmir'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The New York Times'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomacy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}]",,eng-3382459,0.223529411764706,241316700,1,thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,Rex Tillerson Taliban United States Secretary of State United States Pakistan India Afghanistan Government of Pakistan Donald Trump United States Department of State Kashmir The New York Times South Asia Diplomacy China Terrorism,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center-right,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,25,0,2017-08-25

Earlier this month a group of former diplomats, military officials and security experts from the two countries held their third off-the-record meeting in Washington to discuss thorny issues including Pakistan's support for Afghan peace, increasing US ties with Pakistan's arch-rival India, New Delhi's role in Afghanistan and Islamabad's drift toward Beijing after initiation of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Talking to The News after attending the talks, former Pakistan ambassador to the United States Jalil Abbas Jilani said the two sides are having frank discussion on issues and will prepare recommendations for the government for future of ties. He said the informal interaction, also called the ""Track II diplomacy"", aims at bringing private individuals and groups from the two countries to promote better understanding of issues and suggest solutions.

The Pakistan's current ambassador to the US, Aizaz Chaudhry welcomed the interaction. ""Track II is not a substitute for official contacts but officials can benefit from the ideas generated,"" he said.

Representatives from Pakistani side also included former head of Military Intelligence Lt Gen (R) Ishfaq Nadeem Ahmad and former ambassador to Afghanistan Muhammad Sadiq while US side included former US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher, former ambassador Robin Raphel and security experts Dr Tricia Bacon and David Smith.

In his policy speech on Afghanistan on Monday, President Donald Trump lashed out at Pakistan urging it to stop giving sanctuary to ""agents of chaos, violence and terror.""

""We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,"" he said. Pakistan angrily reacted to Trump's speech expressing disappointment over lack of acknowledgement by the president of Pakistan's sacrifices in war against terror. Islamabad is also not happy with US support for its arch-rival India's role in Afghanistan.

Michael Kugelman, Deputy Director of Asia Programme at The Wilson Centre, says the Track II dialogue is meant to convene former government and military officials in a closed, off-the-record environment to discuss possible pathways for cooperation.

""In that sense, the most significant aspect of this interaction was the fact that it took place at all,"" he says. He said apart from terrorism and Afghanistan both sides also discussed some new potential areas of cooperation, including in the field of economics. ""In essence, the dialogue clarified the potential and limits of the relationship. That's a useful thing at a moment when the future of the US-Pakistan relationship is so unsettled,"" he said.

Richard Boucher praised Pakistan for its efforts in war against terror and supported Islamabad's proposal for the border management with Afghanistan. ""Pakistan has expanded its control of its territory, especially into the tribal areas, but still needs to control its border to prevent fighters and supplies from moving across in both directions. We should support that effort,"" he says.

Boucher believes Pakistan and Afghanistan will have to be able to control their borders to achieve lasting peace in each country. The talks are being hosted by two think tanks, Washington DC-based Wilson Centre and Islamabad-based Regional Peace Institute.

Talking to The News, ambassador Aizaz Chaudhry said Pakistan desires peace and stability in Afghanistan as peace in Kabul is good for the entire region. But Pakistani diplomat stressed that after 16 years of conflict, it is clear that lasting peace in Afghanistan can only be achieved through a comprehensive political process. ""Pakistan stands ready to work with Afghanistan and the United States to that end,"" he said.

This objective is not served when one country indulges in a vicious blame game against the other, the ambassador said. ""Incidentally, it is Pakistan -- not Afghanistan -- that has instituted strict border management measures to control cross-border movement. It is time we recognise that,"" he said.

He said terrorism incidents are on decline in Pakistan at a time when these incidents are on the rise in the rest of the world. ""Pakistan would not have achieved such success without conducting counterterrorism operations that were comprehensive and indiscriminate in scope,"" he added.","[{'uri':

Mr. President, unfortunate incident of 9/11 had jolted the whole world. I will not go into various theories and reports on this incident but fact remain that USA directly suffered because of this act of terrorism. The investigations reveal that none of 19 terrorists involved in this heinous crime was of Pakistani origin. In retaliation, the US President Bush decided to attack the terrorists including Osama Bin Laden inside Afghanistan who, reportedly, was the mastermind behind the 9/11 incident and sought the help of President General Musharraf who agreed to cooperate in the larger interest of the global security. The Government of Pakistan, consequently, allowed the space both on ground and air.

Similarly, in the past USA used the soil of Pakistan to fight its war against the erstwhile Soviet Union in Afghanistan. The meeting of Mr. William Casey, the then Director of CIA and Mr. Akhtar A. Rehman, the then DG ISI is also a part of record and this was another favour to USA by helping America in this war. Pakistan became ally both times in good faith and to help the international community on the said war against terrorism.

As a result of Pakistan's engagement in the war on terror, the terrorists (Taliban) became enemies of Pakistan for helping USA and the war shifted from Afghanistan to the soil of Pakistan and we lost Malakand, Swat another areas of Fata to Taliban.

History is a stanch witness to the sacrifices of Pakistan in fighting this war which was imposed on us in a bid to do more and more for USA and its allies. We had been nursing, feeding more than 5.8 million refugees with additional financial burden on account of hosting millions of Afghan refugees. Is it not doing more for Afghanistan apart from helping Afghanistan in their war on terrorism?

Mr. President, this is only Pakistan and Afghanistan where there is no international border control and more than 7000 Afghans move freely to Pakistan on daily basis but Afghanistan never acknowledged and appreciated this generosity of Pakistan rather blamed Pakistan.

It is a matter of fact that Pakistan has always given full support to USA starting from provision of logistic support, facility of air space, sharing of intelligence and conducted many common operations on the Pak-Afghan border.

Pakistan shares the concerns of the international community vis-Ã -vis fragile political and security situation of Afghanistan and Pakistan would, at the same time, remind the international community including USA that Pakistan had played its due and sincere role in the war on terror despite its own financial constraints.

If the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating coupled with frequent terrorist attacks against the US and Afghan personnel and installations despite the heavy presence of US and allied forces in Afghanistan and pumping of billions of dollars then the US Administration is advised to look for the causes and solutions inside Afghanistan rather than Pakistan. Afghanistan has, in fact, become hotbed of terrorism and the terrorist activities inside Pakistan are planned and executed from the soil of Afghanistan contrary to the claim made by you Mr. President.

Mr. President, it is also matter of record that before the start of Zarb-e-Azb, Pakistan had warned Afghanistan to seal the borders to deny the opportunity to the terrorists to cross border in Afghanistan but unfortunately Afghanistan did not cooperate. Now these terrorists are playing in the hands of RAW and NSD, who are being funded and trained by these agencies to carry out terrorist activities inside Pakistan. It is, therefore, absolutely out of context to blame Pakistan for any failure of Afghanistan and allied forces in that country.

Afghanistan is contributing 42% of the drugs to the world and supplying the direct death to European countries and Afghanistan despite having all the support of law enforcement approach have so far failed to stop this growth and supply of drugs.

The US rhetoric vis-Ã -vis 'Do More' had been non-ending despite the facts that Pakistan has done everything possible to combat the terrorists at the cost of its own security and sovereignty. The decision for use of drone attacks on Pakistan soil was a unilateral decision of USA and protest was made against the drone attacks to Mr. Holbrooke, the then Ambassador of USA to Pakistan and Afghanistan. I proposed at that time that drone attacks in Pakistani territory are counterproductive and the local innocent victims are also joining the terrorist organisations, hence drone attacks should be stopped by USA and let Pakistan and USA both to device a common strategy to deal the terrorists both aerial and on ground. USA never agreed to have a common counter-terrorism strategy against the common enemy means terrorists.

I in the capacity of former federal interior minister of Pakistan and having dealt with the issues directly can confirm to you that I have always been advocating with President Bush, President Barack Obama, Ms. Condoleezza Rice and Mr. John Kerry for a common strategy to fight against these terrorists. I have always been giving the suggestion of common counter-terrorism strategy being an ally of USA for which I have been persistently talking on media, writing to all forums including yourself but no attention was given in the past on my suggestion.

I refer to my article published in Pakistan leading English Newspaper ""The News"" dated 20th August, 2017 titled ""Do More Pakistan' syndromes of USA"" and my earlier eight points advice sent to you on 19th May, 2017, wherein I had requested you to please take along the entire Muslim community to fight against few terrorists and you will have full support of Muslims against terrorists.

Mr. President, your threat to the Pakistani nation had been viewed as a callous as Pakistan was expecting that you will treat Pakistan as victim of war and would appreciate its sacrifices in the war on terror. Despite threats from eastern borders, Pakistan has focused its resources both in terms of personnel and finances, on fighting against terrorists inside Pakistan and along Pak-Afghan border. The claim that US has provided billions of dollars to Pakistan has been made out of context as it was never been financial aid but payment against services provided by Pakistan to US forces.

I really appreciated your idea of common strategy for fighting the war against terrorism. People of Pakistan will welcome the outlines of your common strategy against the common enemy and Pakistan will not hesitate to continue to fight against the terrorists and contribute in your common strategy to weed out these enemies of humanity.

Mr. President, Pakistan is a peaceful nation and has suffered a lot since 1979 being supporter of USA - both in Soviet-Afghan war and now in this war on terror -- and instead of asking us to do more, I propose Mr. President you do more and we will contribute our more input in your new strategy to fight against the terrorism for the sake of international peace and to make the world peaceful and terrorism free.

Last but not the least, we are a sovereign state which has always helped USA in this war hence, please do not lend your ears to the Indian Prime Minister Modi as he is inimical against Pakistan and kindly review Mr. Modi's record being a terrorist having once banned to visit USA. He functions through RSS of India, which has a motto to inflict Pakistan at all forums. People of Pakistan will always support any strategy against the terrorists under your vision and we expect that this menace can only be finished with collective wisdom and collective common strategy at all levels to smash these terrorists.

Addressing party workers here, he said that Donald Trump would not have dared threatened Pakistan had former prime minister Nawaz Sharif adopted a clear foreign policy.

He observed that situation would not have turned serious if the federal government had accepted four demands of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, including the appointment of a permanent foreign minister.

Condemning Trump's allegations, he said that the US itself was following an extremist agenda, which created hatred in the region.

He said the entire world recognised Pakistan's efforts against terrorism, adding Pakistan was in a state of war and actively playing role against terrorism but on the other hand, Blackwater, the American company, was reportedly supporting terrorists.

He said the US president should take decisions keeping in view the ground realities.

The PPP leader paid tributes to the Pakistan Army for actions against terrorists and said America's allegations against Pakistan would promote hatred and terrorism.

He said that over 70,000 people and security officials in Pakistan had rendered sacrifices of their lives in the fight against terrorism.

""America's soft policy towards India is a matter of concern,"" the PPP leader said, adding, India itself was involved in terrorism and blaming Pakistan just to hide its own brutalities in occupied Kashmir.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Peoples_Party', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Peoples Party'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Khyber Pakhtunkhwa'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Khyber Pakhtunkhwa'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilawal_Bhutto_Zardari', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bilawal Bhutto Zardari'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nawaz Sharif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Prime Minister of the United Kingdom'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Extremism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Kashmir'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}]",,eng-3382459,-0.2470588235294118,241316700,1,thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,Pakistan Peoples Party Donald Trump Pakistan Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Federal government of the United States Terrorism Bilawal Bhutto Zardari Nawaz Sharif Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Foreign policy Foreign minister Pakistan Army Extremism War Kashmir India,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center-right,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,25,0,2017-08-25

PML-N Senator Javed Abbasi said the US must stop crying for $17 billion which had been given to Pakistan, but it had no idea that the so-called war against terrorism cost Pakistan over $107 billion (Rs11,275 billion) losses.

Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi hinted at discussing the recommendations being finalised by the Senate on the national security in a joint sitting of parliament expected to be convened shortly to discuss US President Donald Trump's threats to Pakistan.

Abbasi came to the Senate to give the promised in-camera briefing on Reko Diq controversy. He held out an assurance to the senators that the recommendations made in the House would be given due importance as it was a matter of national security.

On the occasion, Chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani complained to the PM about the state-run TV for not broadcasting the proceedings of the Senate live when it was debating national security in the wake of Trump's recent statement. The prime minister assured the House that he would take strict action against the state-run TV for skipping the proceedings of the House as he had given clear orders that proceedings of both the houses should be broadcast live if an important issue was under debate.

Winding up the debate, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif shared the details of the National Security Committee meeting, chaired by Abbasi to take stock of the situation in the backdrop of Trump's speech, alleging Pakistan was providing sanctuaries to terrorists. He said the committee rejected the allegations hurled by President Trump against Pakistan and that making Pakistan scapegoat would not bring stability to Afghanistan. The minister added that Pakistan did not allow its soil to be used against any other country and expected the same cooperation from other nations. one hand the Afghan issues brought refugees, arms and drugs to Pakistan while on the other, terrorists safe havens were created in Afghanistan against Pakistan.

Asif brushed aside the billions of dollars aid given to Pakistan as misleading, saying to the extent that reimbursement of Pakistan since 2001 only account for part of the grant for ground facilities and air corridor used by US for its operations in Afghanistan rather than any aid or financial assistance.

""Pakistan's effective counterterrorism operations have clearly proved that tide of terrorism can be reversed and we are willing to share experience with both US and Afghanistan. This would require working together and core issues of eliminating of safe havens inside Afghanistan, border management, return of refugees and reinvigorating the peace process for political settlement in Afghanistan,"" he noted.

Earlier, taking part in the debate, the senators again came hard on President Trump for what they said 'double standards' with regard to Pakistan's relentless sacrifices in war against terrorism: they said the US must know that no peace in Afghanistan was possible without the support of Pakistan.

JUI-F Senator Hafiz Hamdullah criticised the Islamic countries and alleged that heads of 51 countries offered prayers led by US President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia a few months back. ""The leaders of 51 Islamic countries offered prayers behind Trump in Saudi Arabia...the prayers of peace,"" he remarked sarcastically, which according to him was nothing but to endorse US policies in region, as the US wanted to destabilise the region through one way or another.

At this, Rabbani said, ""If I'd made such kind of remarks like Hafiz Hamdullah, the clerics would not have wasted a single second to issue a fatwa (decree) against me"". The JUI-F senator said the US was using Afghanistan as a 'bunker' to protect its interests in the region under the pretext of restoring peace in region, adding that the need of the hour is that the government must start reviewing its foreign policy.

The PML-N Senator Salim Zia was, however, all praise for China and Russia for their support in the wake of Trump's threats and emphasised the time had come Pakistan should divorce US and further strengthen its relations with China, Russia and other friendly countries.

However, independent Senator Mohsin Leghari diverted the senators' attention towards former US President Henry Kissinger, who once said, ""America has no permanent friends or enemies,"" adding this was what Trump was doing, as he will give top priority to his country's interests.

The PPP Senator Murtaza Wahab said Pakistan had to face all these accusations as it failed to project its sacrifices in the war against terrorism. ""The need of the hour is to project our sacrifices,"" he added. As per a commitment made earlier, the prime minister gave in-camera briefing to the Senate on Reko Diq project controversy.","[{'uri': 'mamumtaz_alvi@thenews.com.pk', 'name': 'MAMumtaz Alvi', 'type':

""The Taliban cannot win on the battlefield, it's time for them to join the peace process,"" General John Nicholson told reporters in the Afghan capital, Kabul. ""We will not fail in Afghanistan, our national security depends on that as well.""

While rejecting threats of US general, Taliban say that they would not surrender and continue fight till the presence of last American soldier in Afghanistan. Critics, including Trump himself during the 2016 campaign for the US presidency, have argued that Afghanistan is no closer to peace despite billions of dollars spent on aid and nearly 16 years of US and allied military operations.

In February, Nicholson told the US Congress he needed ""a few thousand"" more troops in Afghanistan, mostly to help advise Afghan security forces that are battling Taliban, Islamic State and other insurgents.

Trump has now approved an extended American presence in Afghanistan, although neither he nor his military leaders have provided any specifics about troop numbers or timelines. The current US force for the predominantly advise-and-assist mission in Afghanistan stands at around 8,400, well down from around 100,000 during the ""surge"" decided on by TrumpÂ´s predecessor, Barack Obama.

Nicholson said new advisers from the US and Nato coalition allies would increase the training missions, including at specialised military schools and expanding the Afghan air force and special forces.

He also praised TrumpÂ´s decision not to impose ""arbitrary"" deadlines on the American mission in Afghanistan. ""This policy announcement is proof of our continued commitment,"" he said.

News Desk adds: While talking to foreign news agency Spokesman of Taliban Zabiullah Mujahid said that he and his other Taliban companions would never surrender and would continue fight on the soil of Afghanistan till the presence of last American soldier. He said that it was the demand of Taliban that US and foreign troops should leave Afghanistan before the start of peace talks.","[{'uri': 'reuters@thenews.com.pk', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'National security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Congress'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Security Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Air force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Special forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabiullah_Mujahid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Zabiullah Mujahid'}}]",,eng-3382459,0.192156862745098,241317480,1,thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,Taliban Afghanistan Donald Trump United States Armed Forces Taliban insurgency National security United States Congress Kabul Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Afghan National Security Forces NATO Air force Insurgency Special forces Barack Obama Zabiullah Mujahid,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center-right,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,38,0,2017-08-25

That the US got defeated in Afghanistan and Pakistan won the war on terror is something which the superpower is not ready to accept. This why the US is placing the blame of its failures on another country. What did Centcom see in Waziristan when taken to the area by DG ISPR Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor to see how the Pakistan Army cleared even the areas which were previously occupied by the Haqqani network? Why was Pakistan praised for the successes on ground and the sacrifices in the war on terror? Why wasn't anything said then like it is being said now? Wasn't Senator John McCan taken to North Waziristan to visit the areas the Pakistan Army cleared from the terrorists? At the end of his visit, the senator told the media that he was satisfied with the successes Pakistan gained. So what went wrong when he reached back to the US?

So why is Trump saying that there are safe havens for terrorists in Pakistan and the US will go after them? Isn't it duplicity? In fact the designs seem different. This is not Trump backing out of the election promise of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. This is a long-term policy based on a grand agenda that is continuing since President Carter and was adopted by Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations. This is not just face saving, but madness on part of the US that has not learned lessons from history. Should Pakistan come up with an equal Kim Jong-style madness to respond to Trump's allegations? Or will the US government make a saner choice by listening to their own observers who are against opening another front of the Afghan war directly involving Pakistan. Since India is the US collaborator, the consequences of such a blunder are likely to be disastrous.","[{'uri': 'ocour_correspondents@thenews.com.pk', 'name': 'OCour Correspondents', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_News_International', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'The News International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waziristan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Waziristan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Inter-Services Public Relations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Waziristan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'North Waziristan'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Senate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Superpower'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Jimmy Carter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bill Clinton'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}]",http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheNewsInternational-Newspost/~4/8q_Ti2Tqm4A,eng-3382459,-0.1686274509803921,241318560,1,thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,Pakistan War on Terror Pakistan Army The News International Afghanistan Waziristan Inter-Services Public Relations North Waziristan United States Senate Superpower Terrorism Jimmy Carter Bill Clinton Barack Obama Federal government of the United States India,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center-right,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,56,0,2017-08-25

Giving a policy statement in the Senate, the minister denied US allegations that Pakistan wanted to destabilise Afghanistan.

""Pakistan has been supporting all international efforts for a peaceful Afghanistan. Islamabad backs Washington and Kabul in their efforts to restore peace in Afghanistan through talks,"" he said.

The minister said the National Security Committee, in its meeting on Thursday, had completely rejected Donald Trump's allegations against Pakistan. ""Scapegoating Pakistan will not stabilise Afghanistan,"" he said.

""Due to the Afghan issue, there has been an influx of refugees, drugs and arms in our country. Safe havens against Pakistan have been formed on the Afghan soil. Pakistan has always taken indiscriminate action against terrorists and has suffered over $120 billion losses in the war on terror. We don't allow our soil to be used against any country and expect other states to reciprocate,"" Asif said.

The foreign minister also said the country was ready to cooperate with the United States and Afghanistan for lasting peace in the region.

The minister slammed India over its role of spreading terrorism in Afghanistan and called it a sensitive issue. ""India wants to de-stabilise Pakistan from both east and the west,"" he said. The minister further mentioned that the NSC members had condemned aggressive Indian policies of waging war in the region, calling it a threat to regional peace. He accused India of using terrorists in order to fulfill its state policies.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi assured the Senate that he would probe why the Pakistan Television (PTV) had not provided live coverage to the debate on the US President Donald Trump's recently announced South Asia strategy.

Earlier, Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani had expressed concern over the non-coverage of the debate.

The PM said he would investigate why a directive in this regard had not been complied with.

During the proceedings, the Senate chairman suggested that the session be extended as the house's foreign affairs committee was in the process of formulating its recommendations on the issue.

To this, the prime minister said the committee should finalise the recommendations which could be communicated to the National Assembly after being adopted by the Senate.

""Even a joint session of the parliament could also be convened on the matter,"" he said.

Prime Minister Abbasi said the federal cabinet had discussed the issue for three hours and the National Security Committee had also deliberated over it during its four-hour long meeting.

Earlier, senators had strongly denounced the statement made by US President Donald Trump about Pakistan and said that the whole nation was on one page against the US new policy.

They were discussing a motion over the US president's new strategy for South Asia and Afghanistan and remarks about Pakistan. They said that Pakistan was a strong and brave nation and Pakistanis knew well how to defend their motherland. The senators said a national narrative against terrorism should be formulated in consultation with all the stakeholders and the parliament.

They said that the foreign policy should be reviewed keeping in view national interests. Some members said that the US ambassador should be summoned to the Foreign Office and a demarche should be issued on the US president's statement.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Senate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Television_Corporation', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Television Corporation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'National Assembly of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raza_Rabbani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Raza Rabbani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cabinet (government)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Parliament'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Prime minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}]",http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/b4bf55fb5473f7e4e82f43b1c9bc383f.jpg ,eng-3382459,0.0980392156862746,241319460,1,dailytimes.com.pk,news,Daily Times,"Khawaja Muhammad Asif Donald Trump United States Senate Islamabad Pakistan India Afghanistan Foreign minister Terrorism Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Pakistan Television Corporation War on Terror United States National Security Council Refugee Washington, D.C.

The rebuttal was issued after a meeting of the National Security Committee attended by top civilian and military leaders chaired by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in Islamabad.

The leadership told the United States, loud and clear, that scapegoating Pakistan will not be helpful in achieving peace in Afghanistan.

The NSC meeting reminded the US that the claims of billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan were also ""misleading to the extent that the reimbursements to Pakistan since 2001 only account for part of the cost of ground facilities and air corridors used by the US for its operations in Afghanistan, rather than any financial aid or assistance.""

The NSC meeting was attended by the services chiefs, key cabinet members and others.

US President Donald Trump this week attacked Pakistan's anti-terror policy. The US leader also conditionalised Pak-US partnership to Islamabad's action against the alleged 'safe havens' of the terrorists.

A participant of the meeting told The Nation that the civil and military leadership was furious about Trump's assault on Pakistan's credibility. ""We all agreed that he had no right to abuse Pakistan in this way especially after we lost so much to terrorism,"" said the source.

He said Prime Minister Abbasi was given the mandate to take up the issue forcefully as relationships with other countries were not above Pakistan's sovereignty.

He said there was a general consensus that Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif should discuss the issue in detail with his US counterpart when he visits Washington.

An official statement issued after the meeting said the NSC discussed the Trump administration's South Asia strategy.

""The committee outrightly rejected the specific allegations and insinuations made against Pakistan. It was observed that to scapegoat Pakistan will not help in stabilising Afghanistan. In fact, being its immediate neighbour, Pakistan has an abiding interest in peace and stability in Afghanistan,"" it said.

The committee observed that Pakistan had to manage the blowback of a protracted conflict in Afghanistan that resulted in a deluge of refugees, a flow of drugs and arms and more recently in the shape of terrorist safe havens in eastern Afghanistan from where anti-Pakistan terrorist groups continue to operate and launch attacks inside Pakistan.

""The fact remains that the complex issues and internal dynamics inside Afghanistan pose a grave challenge not only to Pakistan but to the broader region and the international community,"" it said.

While noting the US commitment to continue to shoulder the burden of Afghanistan and reverse the expanding ungoverned spaces in the country, the committee observed that Pakistan has consistently supported all international efforts for a stable and peaceful Afghanistan and has also committed more than a billion US dollars for infrastructure and social development in that country.

Over the years, Pakistan has worked with both the United States and Afghanistan to promote peace through a politically negotiated outcome which, in Pakistan's view, remains the best option to bring stability to this war-torn country. ""A prolonged military campaign in Afghanistan has resulted in destruction and killing of hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians,"" said the statement.

""Pakistan has also endorsed and supported all Afghan-owned and Afghan-led initiatives for peace,"" it said.

It is Pakistan's expectation that any strategy adopted to stabilize Afghanistan will succeed to end this protracted conflict and usher in an era of peace in the country paving way for the dignified return of millions of Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan for which we are willing to extend all possible cooperation, it added.

""More specifically, we would like to see effective and immediate US military efforts to eliminate sanctuaries harbouring terrorists and miscreants on the Afghan soil including those responsible for fomenting terror in Pakistan. The Afghan war cannot be fought in Pakistan,"" it said.

On its own part, Pakistan has taken indiscriminate actions against all terrorist networks and sacrificed tens of thousands of troops and civilians in this fight. The demonstrated security improvement inside Pakistan would not have been possible without eliminating all terrorist hideouts, the statement said.

""Moreover, successful cooperation with the US in the past against the common enemy, terrorism, reflects Pakistan's unflinching commitment to eliminate this menace,"" it said.

The committee stressed that ""instead of any financial or material assistance, there should be understanding and recognition of our efforts, contributions, and sacrifice of thousands of Pakistanis and over 120 billion US dollars of economic losses. We consider the lives of the citizens of other countries as sacrosanct as those of our own and, therefore, Pakistan is committed to not allowing its soil to be used for violence against any other country. We expect the same from our neighbours"".

""Pakistan's effective counter-terrorism operations have clearly proved that the tide of terrorism can be reversed and we are willing to share our experience with both the US and Afghanistan,"" it said.

""This would require working together and focusing on core issues of eliminating safe havens inside Afghanistan, border management, the return of refugees and reinvigorating the peace process for a political settlement in Afghanistan,"" it said.

The NSC stressed that India cannot be a net security provider in the South Asia region when it has conflictual relationships with all its neighbours and is pursuing a policy of destabilizing Pakistan from the east and the west. The Committee expressed deep concern at Indian policies inimical to peace in the region including interference in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries and using terrorism as an instrument of state policy.

The committee condemned the state inflicted repression on the people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and reiterated Pakistan's continued diplomatic, political and moral support for their struggle for self-determination.

The committee reaffirmed Pakistan's resolve to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The committee underscored that as a responsible nuclear weapon state, Pakistan has in place a robust and credible command and control system which has been universally recognized and appreciated.

Pakistan will continue to extend all possible cooperation to the international community for achieving the common objectives of peace and stability in Afghanistan and in the broader region, the NSC decided.

Meanwhile, the fourth round of Pakistan-China bilateral consultations on arms control and non-proliferation was held here. The Pakistan side was led by Ambassador Tasnim Aslam, Additional Secretary (United Nations and Economic Coordination). Ambassador Wang Qun, Director General of the Arms Control Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China led the Chinese delegation.

A foreign ministry statement said the consultations covered a broad range of issues related to arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation on which the two sides shared a commonality of perspectives.

On the issue of Nuclear Supplier Group's membership and applications of states who are not members of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Pakistan underscored the need for a two-step approach through open and transparent inter-governmental procedures and the principle of reaching an agreement through consultations.

In a separate statement, the foreign ministry condemned the suicide attack in Helmand (Afghanistan).

The statement said that Pakistan strongly condemns the suicide attack on Police Patrol in Lashkargah (Helmand), resulting in the deaths of many people including civilians and injuries to several others.

""We convey heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and pray for the early recovery of the injured,"" the statement said.

It added: ""Pakistan reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Terrorism is a common enemy and global menace. Pakistan reaffirms its unrelenting efforts in fighting this menace.""

He claimed that President Donald Trump's new strategy is a sign of a long-term commitment to what is already America's longest war.

Nicholson said new advisers from the United States and NATO coalition allies would increase the training missions, including at specialised military schools and expanding the Afghan air force and special forces.

He also praised Trump's decision not to impose ""arbitrary"" deadlines on the American mission in Afghanistan. ""This policy announcement ... is proof of our continued commitment,"" he said.

The US general vowed to annihilate the Islamic State and crush what remains of Al-Qaeda after President Trump announced a renewed effort in the war that has dragged on for nearly 16 years.

He told reporters that additional US troops will further train Afghan forces and promised more air support.

America's recent policy on Afghanistan reiterates old views. Trump's policy is as the saying goes, the same old wine in a new bottle - only that the packaging is a bit fragile this time and the bottle can shatter into pieces any time soon.

In a sense, it's the timeworn mantra of ""do more"" of the pre-Waziristan operation. How much more would be enough to satisfy the super-huge ego of the new US president remains undetermined.

While the US frustration regarding the war in Afghanistan is understandable, it will be intriguing to see how Pakistan responds to the new geo-strategic challenge.

Mr. Trump who is new in the office needs a lesson in history. If the Great Britain couldn't win Afghanistan after three destructive wars spanning over a century, how could the USdo so in merely three or four presidential terms?

Meanwhile, the hard and bitter reality is that after 16 years of military engagement, about 3000 US causalities, and well over 800 billion dollars spending, more than one third of the Afghan territory is still under the Taliban control; the country continues to be the largest producer of opium; and the tribal-cum-ethnic differences show no sign of dissipating.

Mr. Trump's plan clearly overlooks Pakistan's sacrifices in the war on terror, its selflessness to host more than three million Afghan refugees for well over three decades, and its concerns with regard to India's role in the whole issue.

It's natural for Pakistan to reassess its policies a and come up with a pragmatic and result-oriented strategy for the future.

An ideal way to solve an intractable issue would be to start at the very beginning. That's to say, how it all started in the first place; how it evolved over time; and, how to reverse the wheel of time to bring forth the desired results in its final conclusion?

The first policy decision that Pakistan is most likely to take may concern the Afghan nationals living on its soil. Frankly speaking, a great majority of them are economic refugees, whom not even Mr. Trump would welcome in his homeland.

As recent events suggest, they aren't only a security threat but also a liability in socio-economic terms. A country faced with a host of domestic issues cannot afford the economic burden of supporting more refugees.

There's a simple formula to cope with the problem. It is necessary to come up with a level ofeconomic investment for those who're interested to stay in Pakistan peacefully and don't pose a threat to their own country. There shouldn't be any more deadline extensions either - like the one the former PM Nawaz Sharif announced last November when the repatriation process was in full swing.

The hard and bitter reality is that after 16 years of military engagement, about 3000 US causalities, and well over 800 billion dollars spending, more than one third of the Afghan territory is still under the Taliban control

The second step is to involve friendly countries like China, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. Chinaalready came to Pakistan's aid soon after Mr. Trump's address. And Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi left for the KSA on Wednesday to drum up support for his country.

With tact and diplomacy, Central Asian states, as well as Iranand Turkey's support could be sought, which will assist in tilting the regional equilibrium in Pakistan's favour.

If things really go downhill, it can also involve Russia more proactively as a last resort.

After all, if the US could defeat the Soviet Union with the help of Pakistan, the reverse could also happen. The spadework in this respect has already been done. All that would be necessary is a little push to build on what has already been achieved.

Pakistan also needs to speed up border fencing and implement strict border regime on the western front. Strategically, it's more important than theEastern border, given the American presence. While the Torkham Pass is by and large secure now, there's a need to take steps for the Chaman crossing point.

Last but not the least, the supply lines to Afghanistan should now strictly be monitored by a state institution that has the full capability and expertise to evaluate the strategic implications for the country in the short or long term. The overall aim should be that no military hardware passes through its territory that could be used against it at some point in time.

The fact is the Afghan mess is not of Pakistan's making. If anything, it's the result of the Cold War rivalry between the super powers of the 1960s, the USSR and the US. If there's one country that has suffered most due to the instability in Afghanistan, it's Pakistan.

This is something which the superpower is not digesting. That's why they are shifting blame of their own failures. But this is not the only thing. There are many more reasons. What did the Centcom see in Waziristan when DG ISPR Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor took him to personally watch how Pakistan Army cleared even the areas which were previously occupied by Haqqani Network? Why did he praise Pakistan for successes on ground and sacrifices in the war against terror? Why didn't they say anything which Trump says now? Did he tell lie and reported negative back in Washington?

Wasn't Senator John McCan taken to North Waziristan and visited the areas Pakistan Army got cleared from the terrorists? At the end of his visit, the Senator told media that he was satisfied with the successes gained by Pakistan. He praised Pakistan's role and sacrifices of its soldiers in the war against terror? Then what went wrong when he reached back in Washington? Did he tell a lie with our press? Or he told a lie to Trump administration? Where have gone the superpower's hi-tech detection and surveillance gadgets, satellite systems closely watching and monitoring the earth, areas of trouble, terrorists and their safe havens? Where is then the intelligence sharing and information mechanism? Pakistan has operated, cleared areas and killed terrorists on the pinpointing of Pentagon and US Commanders in Afghanistan.

Then why Trump and Mattis and McMaster say there exist safe havens and America will go after them? Isn't it duplicity and double game? In fact the designs seem different. This is not Mr Trump backing out of the election promise of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. This is a long term policy based on grand agenda that is continuing since President Carter and continuing during Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations. This is not just face saving, but madness on part of the US that has not learnt lessons from history. Should Pakistan come up with an equal Kim Jong style to respond to Trump's? Or sanity should prevail upon the US govt to listen to their own observers who suggest not opening another front of Afghan war directly involving Pakistan. While India is its collaborator, consequences of such a blunder are likely to be disastrous.

MUCH debated and much awaited South Asian policy review by Trump Administration has ultimately been completed amid fierce debate among proponents of sending more troops to Afghanistan and exponents of complete withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. The speculations about future US policy options in the region have continued since past one and a half months. US Secretary of Defense, Mattis, highlighting that South Asian strategy will have a regional context, though bilateral relations will be the important component of the overall strategy.

Contrary to his previous pronouncements about ending the America's longest war, President Trump announced sending more troops to Afghanistan. Though he did not provide the detailed numbers, White House officials disclosed that he authorized his defence Secretary to deploy up to 3,900 more troops to Afghanistan. In his first formal address to the nation as commander-in-chief, President Trump admitted that initially he intended 'to pull out' but after deliberations, he had concluded that 'the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable and leaving a vacuum.' He challenged the cherished values of American liberalism - notions of constructing democracies in faraway lands and sounded more realist while saying that 'we are not nation building again. We are killing terrorists.' Earlier, it was reported that Afghan Taliban in an open letter to President Trump had warned of sending more troops to Afghanistan as self-destructive for the US and called for complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. After the announcement of policy, Afghan Taliban dismissed Trump policy as vague and ambiguous.

Unable to tackle the situation in Afghanistan, the continuous statements from US officials from State Department shows the misperceptions in US policy making circles that insurgency in Afghanistan is controlled and sustained by Taliban especially Haqqani factions allegedly from their sanctuaries in Pakistan. President Trump warned of Pakistan about 'vital aid cut' and said that US will not remain silent about terrorist safe heavens in Pakistan. The US ignores the fact that much discussed 'Pakistan's aid issue' in US Congress has been part of Coalition Support Fund (CSF) that Pakistan has been using in facilitating coalition forces in their war on terror activities in Afghanistan. Moreover, Pakistan has been fighting Taliban insurgencies in FATA region and to consolidate the gains of the military operations, Pakistan has launched a comprehensive operation, Radd-ul-Fasaad.

Sustaining the current administrative set up of Afghanistan has been a priority for new US government and in this regard, Trump Administration is willing to provide money to Afghan government. Given the discord and frictions in Unity government in Afghanistan and due to corruption and mismanagement of resources it is unlikely that money provided by US could be used on socio-economic uplift of people rather this task has been assigned to India. President Trump in his address urged India to spend more on economic development of Afghanistan.

India has been provided a larger role in Afghanistan by the US. The issue of concern for Pakistan has been the convergence of Indo-US interests on the issue of terrorism. The joint communiquÃ© signed during Prime Minister Modi's visit to US in April this year reiterated their earlier allegations accusing Pakistan of supporting terrorism against India and Afghanistan. In this regard, the recent move shows indifference of US towards legitimate struggle of Kashmiris for their right to self-determination. US recently designated Kashmiri organization Hizbul Mujahideen as terrorist outfit, freezing its assets and banning US financial transactions with the group. This announcement came after two months, when State department declared the Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin as a global terrorist. This is a deliberate attempt to link the legitimate freedom struggle of Kashmiris to the terrorism. The brutality and violence unleashed by Indian security forces and the state terrorism of India since past one year has not prompted a response from the United States not even a word of condemnation - for grave human rights violations.

Richard N. Haass, President of the Council of Foreign Relations, in his recent writing has made some valuable suggestions regarding future foreign policy challenges for Trump Administration. He proposed various policy options for US foreign policy ranging from Europe to China and from North Korea to Syria but has not touched upon South Asia or Afghanistan that carries the burden of America's longest war. It is reported that US has spent almost $700 billion in the first thirteen years of the war in Afghanistan. Still, Afghan forces lack the capacity to resist Taliban forces, as is evident from heavy casualties incurred by Afghan National Forces during Taliban's 'Spring Offensive.' Weather the allocation of more resources - human as well as material by the US will make any difference? The fifteen years history of US war in Afghanistan doubts it. What change will it bring for the people of Afghanistan? and how the war ravaged country will survive the prolonged war in future?

As regards the 'regional context' of the US policy, Pakistan needs to formulate a proactive policy at least towards Afghanistan. Pakistan should discuss issues of divergence with Afghan government and reach to an understanding vis-Ã -vis issue of border management and terrorism. As regards Pakistan's relations with India, no improvement can be anticipated given the convergence of Indo-US security interests and the dominance of extreme right in internal politics of two states that is contributing in developing a new partnership between the so called largest and the oldest democracies of the world.

They not only condemned unanimously anti-Pakistan rhetoric in President Trump's pronouncement but some of them also suggested that Islamabad should revisit terms of engagement with Washington.

It has rightly been pointed out that the US objective seems to be squeezing Pakistan both from the East and the West for which praises are being showered on India, New Delhi is being given undue role in Afghanistan and there are leaks in American media that India might invade Pakistan. In this backdrop, Chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani deserves credit for making candid observations and talking plainly to the United States warning it of the serious consequences of ditching an ally in the war against terror. He advised government to cancel proposed visit of Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif to the United States in protest, though not a wise option as engagement is necessary to sort out difference, and also went a step further in forming a Committee that would frame policy guidelines on the US strategy. We hope that the Committee formed by the Upper House would come out with practicable and effective proposals to counter threat to the core interests of Pakistan in the new regional and global game. There are also fears that the real objective of the new game is to deprive Pakistan of its nuclear capability, which has been the dream of every American administration. There is every reason for Pakistan to review the rules of engagement with the United States and this should be done strictly in accordance with the guiding principles to be drawn by the Senate of Pakistan. Pakistan has always accepted all American demands without getting anything substantial. Washington says it spent billions of dollars on Pakistan but people of Pakistan are at a loss to understand where these dollars have gone.

Sophia Siddiqui/Zahid Chaudhray

Islamabad

The National security Committee reaffirmed Pakistan's resolve to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity and top civil military leadership agreed to project Pakistan's stance on US Afghan policy issued by president Trump on Tuesday.

The National Security Committee here on Thursday discussed the Trump Administration's South Asia Strategy, according to press release issued by PM office.

The Committee underscored that as a responsible nuclear weapon state, Pakistan has in place a robust and credible command and control system which has been universally recognized and appreciated.

Meeting agreed that Pakistan will continue to extend all possible cooperation to the international community for achieving the common objectives of peace and stability in Afghanistan and in the region.

The forum rightly rejected the specific allegations and insinuations made against Pakistan. It was observed that making scapegoate to Pakistan will not help in stabilizing Afghanistan. In fact, being its immediate neighbour, Pakistan has an abiding interest in peace and stability in Afghanistan.

The committee observed that Pakistan had to manage the blowback of a protracted conflict in Afghanistan that resulted in deluge of refugees, flow of drugs and arms and more recently in the shape of terrorist safe havens in eastern Afghanistan from where anti-Pakistan terrorist groups continue to operate and launch attacks inside Pakistan. The fact remains that the complex issues and internal dynamics inside Afghanistan pose a grave challenge not only to Pakistan but to the broader region and the international community.

While noting the US commitment to continue to shoulder the burden of Afghanistan and reverse the expanding ungoverned spaces in the country, the committee observed that Pakistan has consistently supported all international efforts for a stable and peaceful Afghanistan and has also committed more than a billion US dollars for infrastructure and social development in that country.

Over the years, Pakistan has worked with both the United States and Afghanistan to promote peace through a politically negotiated outcome which, in Pakistan's view, remains the best option to bring stability to this war torn country. A prolonged military campaign in Afghanistan has resulted in destruction and killing of hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians.

Pakistan has also endorsed and supported all Afghan owned and Afghan led initiatives for peace.

It is Pakistan's expectation that any strategy adopted to stabilize Afghanistan will succeed to end this protracted conflict and usher in an era of peace in the country paving way for the dignified return of millions of Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan for which we are willing to extend all possible cooperation.

More specifically, we would like to see effective and immediate US military efforts to eliminate sanctuaries harbouring terrorists and miscreants on the Afghan soil including those responsible for fomenting terror in Pakistan. The Afghan war cannot be fought in Pakistan.

On its own part, Pakistan has taken indiscriminate actions against all terrorist networks and sacrificed tens of thousands of troops and civilians in this fight. The demonstrated security improvement inside Pakistan would not have been possible without eliminating all terrorist hideouts. Moreover, successful cooperation with the US in the past against the common enemy, terrorism, reflects Pakistan's unflinching commitment to eliminate this menace.

The committee stressed that instead of any financial or material assistance, there should be understanding and recognition of our efforts, contributions and sacrifice of thousands of Pakistanis and over 120 billion US dollars of economic losses. We consider the lives of the citizens of other countries as sacrosanct as those of our own and, therefore, Pakistan is committed to not allowing its soil to be used for violence against any other country. We expect the same from our neighbours. The claims of Billions of Dollars in aid to Pakistan are also misleading to the extent that the reimbursements to Pakistan since 2001 only account for part of the cost of ground facilities and air corridors used by the United States for its operations in Afghanistan, rather than any financial aid or assistance.

Pakistan's effective counter-terrorism operations have clearly proved that tide of terrorism can be reversed and we are willing to share our experience with both the US and Afghanistan. This would require working together and focusing on core issues of eliminating safe havens inside Afghanistan, border management, return of refugees and reinvigorating the peace process for a political settlement in Afghanistan.

The Committee stressed that India cannot be a net security provider in the South Asia region when it has conflictual relationships with all its neighbours and is pursuing a policy of destabilizing Pakistan from the east and the west. The Committee expressed deep concern at Indian policies inimical to peace in the region including interference in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries and using terrorism as an instrument of state policy.

The Committee condemned state inflicted repression on the people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and reiterated Pakistan's continued diplomatic, political and moral support for their struggle for self determination",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Territorial integrity'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'National security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereignty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Command and control'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Illegal drug trade'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear weapon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Infrastructure'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States dollar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_refugees', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan refugees'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IsraeliâPalestinian_peace_process', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'IsraeliâPalestinian peace process'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Self-determination'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Jammu and Kashmir'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Jammu and Kashmir'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}]",http://pakobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1489714-pmshahidkhaqanabbasichairsnscmeetinginp-1503560079-747-640x480.jpg,eng-3382459,0.2392156862745098,241327560,1,pakobserver.net,news,Pakistan Observer,Terrorism United States Pakistan Afghanistan Territorial integrity United States National Security Council International community National security Sovereignty Islamabad Command and control Illegal drug trade Refugee South Asia Nuclear weapon Infrastructure United States dollar Afghan refugees Counter-terrorism United States Armed Forces IsraeliâPalestinian peace process Self-determination Jammu and Kashmir India,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,26,3,2017-08-25

While speaking on the Geo News show, Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath, the foreign minister said that they went to Saudi Arabia a day earlier to speak to the Saudi leadership and explain the matter to them.

""We will contact China, Russia [and other countries of the region] in the coming days in order to get a regional consensus and a solution.""

The foreign minister said he would also go to the US to put the matter on the table for talks with the leadership there.

While reiterating Asif's comments, a South Asia expert, Moeed Yusuf, said it was important for the Pakistani leadership to present that matter for talks, as without doing so the two countries might miscalculate each other's red line.

Asif further said Pakistan wants peace in the region not only for itself but also for the people in the region, including Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

""Pakistan would never want unrest in Afghanistan as it would also clash with the country's own interest,"" the foreign minister added.

However, Asif said, in an attempt to find a peaceful solution with the US, Pakistan would not keep unrealistic expectations.

""Nevertheless, since talking straight is the need of the hour, Pakistan would do so,"" the country's foreign minister maintained.

According to Yusuf, people in both the US and Pakistan do not want relations between the two countries to 'rupture'.

""But now that such extreme positions have surfaced, the matter might go to an unfavourable extent.""

On August 22, Trump backtracked from his promise to end America's longest war while pillorying Pakistan for offering safe haven to ""agents of chaos"".

""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,"" he said, warning that vital aid could be cut. ""That will have to change and that will change immediately.""

However, earlier on Thursday, Asif said the National Security Committee completely rejected Trump's allegations against Pakistan.

""The Taliban cannot win on the battlefield; it's time for them to join the peace process,"" General John Nicholson told reporters in Kabul. ""We will not fail in Afghanistan; our national security depends on that as well.""

Critics, including Trump himself, have argued in the past that Afghanistan is no closer to peace despite billions of dollars spent on aid and nearly 16 years of US and allied military operations.

Urges militants to join peace efforts

In February, Gen Nicholson told the US Congress he needed ""a few thousand"" more troops in Afghanistan, mostly to help advise Afghan security forces that are battling Taliban and fighters from other militant groups.

Trump has now approved an extended American presence in Afghanistan, although neither he nor his military leaders have provided any specifics about troop numbers or timelines.

The current US force for the predominantly advise-and-assist mission in Afghanistan stands at around 8,400, well down from around 100,000 during the ""surge"" decided on by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.

Several thousand more troops are often in the country on ""temporary"" or other uncounted missions.

Nicholson said new advisers from the United States and Nato coalition allies would increase the training missions, including at specialised military schools, and expand the Afghan air force and special forces.

He also praised Trump's decision not to impose ""arbitrary"" deadlines on the American mission in Afghanistan. ""This policy announcement... is proof of our continued commitment,"" he said.

The Taliban government was overthrown by US-backed Afghan forces in late 2001 but US forces have been bogged down there ever since. About 2,400 US troops have been killed in Afghanistan.

The US military and intelligence officials are concerned that a new Taliban victory would allow Al Qaeda and the militant Islamic State group to establish bases in Afghanistan.

That could allow them to plot attacks against the United States and its allies, they fear, just as Osama bin Laden had done with the Sept 11, 2001, strikes that triggered the war in Afghanistan.","[{'uri': 'reuters@dawn.com', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Security Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'National security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Congress'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Air force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Special forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Military intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Osama bin Laden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}]",http://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/08/599fa0784599c.jpg,eng-3382459,0.3019607843137255,241330740,1,dawn.com,news,Dawn,Taliban Afghanistan Donald Trump Afghan National Security Forces National security United States Armed Forces United States Congress Kabul Afghan Armed Forces NATO Air force Special forces Barack Obama Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Military intelligence Osama bin Laden Al-Qaeda,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,19,4,2017-08-25

The rare reaction came in a policy statement issued by the office of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi after a meeting of the civilian and military leadership.

President Donald Trump has accused Pakistan of harbouring ""agents of chaos"" and providing safe havens to militant groups waging an insurgency against a U.S.-backed government in Kabul. Islamabad, he said, must quickly change tack.

Pakistan, however, saw things differently.

""We would like to see effective and immediate U.S. military efforts to eliminate sanctuaries harbouring terrorists and miscreants on Afghan soil, including those responsible for fomenting terror in Pakistan,"" the Prime Minister's office said in a statement, one of the strongest ever responses to Washington. The Afghan war cannot be fought in Pakistan, it said.

The statement referred not only to the Afghan Taliban, but also the loosely affiliated Pakistani Taliban that Islamabad contends uses sanctuaries inside Afghanistan to plan attacks on Pakistani soil.

White House officials have threatened cuts in aid and military support, as well as other measures to force nuclear-armed Pakistan's hand and bring about an end to the 16-year-war.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Washington should not use Pakistan as a ""scapegoat"" for its failures in America's longest running war. Pakistan denies harbouring militants.

The military, which has ruled the country for over half its 70-year history, calls the shots on key parts of Pakistan's foreign policy, including ties with the United States, Afghanistan and arch-foe India.

The prime minister's office said Washington's claims it had paid billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan were misleading.

Payments to Pakistan since 2001 accounted for only part of the cost of ground facilities and air corridors used by the U.S. for operations in Afghanistan, it said.

Pakistani officials bristle at what they say is a lack of respect by Washington for the country's sacrifices in the war against militancy and its successes against groups like al Qaeda, Islamic State or the Pakistani Taliban.

Pakistan estimates there have been 70,000 casualties in militant attacks, including 17,000 killed, since it joined the U.S. ""war on terrorism"" after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

""We feel the American administration led by Mr Trump has been totally one sided, unfair to Pakistan and does not appreciate and recognise Pakistan has been a pivotal player,"" Senator Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the senate defence committee, told Reuters on Thursday.

Some analysts have suggested putting greater pressure on Pakistan risks driving Islamabad deeper into the arms of China, its northern neighbour which is investing nearly $60 billion in infrastructure projects as part of its Belt and Road initiative.

China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call the United States must value Pakistan's role in Afghanistan and respect its security concerns, according to Chinese state media.

The relationship between the two countries has endured periods of extreme strain in recent years, especially after al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. special forces in Pakistan in a 2011 raid. -Reuters","[{'uri': 'asim_malik@aaj.tv', 'name': 'Asim Malik', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear weapon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'White House'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Senate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Jiechi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Yang Jiechi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Special forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Osama bin Laden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Reuters'}}]",http://aaj.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pm1.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.1372549019607843,241331280,1,aaj.tv,news,AAJ.TV,"United States Armed Forces Islamabad Pakistan Afghanistan Taliban Washington, D.C.

He is also the author of several books, monographs and articles on Pakistan and South Asian affairs

The long-awaited new United States policy on Afghanistan, announced by President Donald Trump on August 21, 2017, represents a narrowly focused ambitious agenda for peace and stability in Afghanistan. India and Pakistan have been asked to play two different but supportive roles for American policy -- India contributing liberally to Afghanistan's economic reconstruction and rehabilitation and Pakistan pursuing a counterterrorism policy articulated by Washington. The new Afghanistan policy does not entertain the regional approach to conflict resolution in Afghanistan and the dialogue option with the Taliban has also been shelved by the US, at least for the time being.

Three features of American policy in Afghanistan are noteworthy. First, the notion of a deadline for withdrawal of American troops has been discarded, implying that the US will maintain its military presence in Afghanistan for an indefinite period. Second, the US is expected to increase its troops in Afghanistan by a couple of thousand. Third, the US will no longer pursue economic reconstruction and nation-building but would go after the terrorist groups like the Islamic State or Da'ish, al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban by all possible means.

Such an approach can provide a basis to the US to stay on in Afghanistan but it does not guarantee that it would succeed in eliminating terrorism and internal instability in Afghanistan. This is surprising that after failing to eliminate the Afghan Taliban in the past when the US had over 100,000 troops, the US still wants to give precedence to military means. The long-term elimination of terrorism requires that military measures are backed by socio-economic and political measures and the ordinary people should be given a hope for a better socio-economic future. Afghanistan has suffered much damage by the terrorism and internal war going back to 1979-80. How can the trust of common Afghan be secured if they cannot get out of poverty and under-development?

Though the US expects Nato to continue supporting the new American initiative, the address by President Trump creates the strong impression that the actual implementation of the policy will be the exclusive concern of the US administration. Others like Nato, India and Pakistan are expected to fall in line. However, the efforts of China and Russia to evolve a regional approach for peace and stability in the region have been ignored altogether. Trump's well-known slogan ""America First"" appears to have shaped the framework of the new Afghan policy. The notion of ""America's burden"" to save Afghanistan and adjoining region from terrorism reflects an exaggerated view of the operational capacity of the US for pursuing its global agenda against terrorism in Afghanistan.

While acknowledging the contribution of Pakistan for countering terrorism in the region, President Trump has repeated the American charge against Pakistan that it provided safe haven to Afghan Taliban. This is not for the first time that Pakistan has been accused of colluding with the Afghan Taliban. However, President Trump has said this in categorical terms and raised this issue more than once in his speech. He also talked of the US giving ""billions and billions of dollars"" to Pakistan but it ""housed"" the Afghan Taliban who killed American soldiers in Afghanistan.

The single variable explanation of blaming Pakistan for American failure in Afghanistan is a simplistic explanation of a complex situation. The movement of militant groups is two-way across the Pakistan-Afghan border. If Afghan Taliban activists cross into Pakistan, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan fighters are based in Afghanistan. Their fighters come to Pakistan for engaging in terrorist activities. The US, like Afghanistan, is not prepared to contain the safe havens of the Pakistani Taliban in Afghanistan. Pakistani sectarian-Islamic groups also take refuge in Afghanistan.

Afghan Taliban overlap with over 2 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. In addition to this, there are Pakistani Pakhtuns. It is not always possible to identify who is a genuine Afghan fighter. As the Pakistani Taliban are based in Afghanistan, the one-sided American statements against Pakistan will not help. This problem can be addressed by adopting a comprehensive approach rather than engaging in blame game.

First, Pakistan should seek verifiable information about Afghan Taliban camps in Pakistan from the US. Second, it should insist on the US to join with Pakistan for an effective security of the Pakistan-Afghan border so that the two-way movement of Taliban activists is stopped. US troops in Afghanistan should seal the border on the Afghan side and Pakistan is already taking care of the Pakistani side of the border. Both should coordinate their security arrangements. If the border is effectively secured, no Taliban can move in either direction.

Third, the regional approach to peace and stability should be encouraged. China and Russia need to work together with Afghanistan and its neighbors to seek a workable solution of the Afghan imbroglio. The US can join this effort.

Fourth, the US should persuade India to resume dialogue with Pakistan. This will decrease tension in the region and moderate Pakistan's concerns about the US-backed active Indian role in Afghanistan. Fifth, the US should dispassionately review how far three major deficiencies of poor governance, corruption in government and professional problems in Afghan military have adversely affected the Afghan government's response to internal conflict.

Sixth, the Foreign Office should dispassionately study why Pakistan's claim that there are no safe havens in Pakistan is not viewed as credible at the international level. Why has Pakistan not been able to convince other countries about its positive contribution towards countering terrorism in and around Pakistan and why its sacrifices in this respect are not fully recognised? There is a need to update Pakistan's diplomatic strategies and ways and means to address the terrorism-related issues at the international level.

Seventh, why did Pakistan's Foreign Office take about 16 hours to give the initial reaction to President Trump's charge sheet against Pakistan. China's comments on President Trump's statement came long before the Foreign Office response.

It is an erroneous assumption that Pakistan's public denunciation or a hardline approach will force Pakistan to fall in line with Washington's priorities for countering terrorism in and around Afghanistan. A consultative and shared approach stands a better chance because there is no quick-fix for Afghanistan.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Socioeconomics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington (state)'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington (state)'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_refugees', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan refugees'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtuns', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pashtuns'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Political corruption'}}]",https://c.tribune.com.pk/2017/08/1490171-DrHasanAskariRizviNew-1503592618-461-640x480.JPG,eng-3382459,0.03529411764705892,241332360,1,tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,Donald Trump Taliban Terrorism United States Pakistan India Afghanistan NATO Socioeconomics South Asia Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Washington (state) Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan Counter-terrorism Al-Qaeda Federal government of the United States Russia China Afghan refugees Pashtuns Foreign and Commonwealth Office Afghan Armed Forces Political corruption,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,46,4,2017-08-25

The hours and days since President Trump sketched his future strategy for Afghanistan and the region generally have done nothing to repair relations and Pakistan is responding assertively to some of the proposals contained therein. A visit by US envoy Hale to GHQ in Rawalpindi on Wednesday August 23 produced two things -- firstly that Pakistan does not need the financial assistance of Washington; and secondly that Pakistan will not be caving in to pressure from the Trump administration and will forge its own path in terms of its relationship with Afghanistan, latest American threats notwithstanding.

America under Trump has made a clear statement as to where it is aligned, and India is seen as a regional partner with a future. Pakistan, unless it complies with -- or even shares the American analysis of -- the Pax Americana has little by way of a future beyond being excess baggage. Unsurprisingly the push-back from the Pakistan side and the playing of one of the few cards we hold namely the role potentially played with the Afghan Taliban and their participation in future peace talks -- takes us ever closer to China and Russia. With the US already at odds with Russia and having a growing concern about the direction of China and the 'One Belt, One Road' project the die appears to be cast for years to come.

As a worst case scenario Pakistan may find its major non-Nato ally status revoked and sanctions imposed. Pakistan may cut the American supply route to Afghanistan or revoke overfly permissions. The status quo is not an option for either party and the geo-political compass is being re-swung. For Pakistan the danger is that its own interests will be subsumed by external actors -- China and Russia -- which are far more powerful and whose only interest in Pakistan is what can be extracted from it to further their own ends. The visit of the foreign minister to Washington should go ahead as planned and he should carry with him a detailed brief as to just how little Pakistan needs Uncle Sam -- and how little sense it makes to bring India into the Afghanistan endgame to the exclusion of Pakistan.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headquarters', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Headquarters'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rawalpindi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Rawalpindi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Status quo'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Geopolitics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Economic sanctions'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Uncle Sam'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}]",https://c.tribune.com.pk/2017/08/1490150-trump-1503635346-211-640x480.jpg,eng-3382459,0.06666666666666665,241332720,1,tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,"Pakistan Donald Trump United States Afghanistan Presidency of Donald Trump Headquarters Washington, D.C.

Earlier this month a group of former diplomats, military officials and security experts from the two countries held their third off-the-record meeting in Washington to discuss thorny issues including Pakistan's support for Afghan peace, increasing US ties with Pakistan's arch-rival India, New Delhi's role in Afghanistan and Islamabad's drift toward Beijing after initiation of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Talking to The News after attending the talks, former Pakistan ambassador to the United States Jalil Abbas Jilani said the two sides are having frank discussion on issues and will prepare recommendations for the government for future of ties. He said the informal interaction aims at bringing private individuals and groups from the two countries to promote better understanding of issues and suggest solutions.

Pakistan ambassador to the US, Aizaz Chaudhry welcomed the interaction. ""Track II is not a substitute for official contacts but officials can benefit from the ideas generated,"" he said.

Representatives from Pakistani side also included former head of Military Intelligence Lt Gen (R) Ishfaq Nadeem Ahmad and former ambassador to Afghanistan Muhammad Sadiq while US side included former US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher, former ambassador Robin Raphel and security experts Dr Tricia Bacon and David Smith.

In his policy speech on Afghanistan on Monday, President Donald Trump lashed out at Pakistan urging it to stop giving sanctuary to ""agents of chaos, violence and terror.""

""We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,"" he said. Pakistan angrily reacted to Trump's speech expressing disappointment over lack of acknowledgement by the president of Pakistan's sacrifices in war against terror. Islamabad is also not happy with US support for its arch-rival India's role in Afghanistan.

Michael Kugelman, Deputy Director of Asia Programme at The Wilson Centre, says the Track II dialogue is meant to convene former government and military officials in a closed, off-the-record environment to discuss possible pathways for cooperation.

""In that sense, the most significant aspect of this interaction was the fact that it took place at all,"" he says. He said apart from terrorism and Afghanistan both sides also discussed some new potential areas of cooperation, including in the field of economics. ""In essence, the dialogue clarified the potential and limits of the relationship. That's a useful thing at a moment when the future of the US-Pakistan relationship is so unsettled,"" he said.

Richard Boucher praised Pakistan for its efforts in war against terror and supported Islamabad's proposal for the border management with Afghanistan. ""Pakistan has expanded its control of its territory, especially into the tribal areas, but still needs to control its border to prevent fighters and supplies from moving across in both directions. We should support that effort,"" he says.

Boucher believes Pakistan and Afghanistan will have to be able to control their borders to achieve lasting peace in each country. The talks are being hosted by two think tanks, Washington DC-based Wilson Centre and Islamabad-based Regional Peace Institute.

Talking to The News, ambassador Aizaz Chaudhry said Pakistan desires peace and stability in Afghanistan as peace in Kabul is good for the entire region. But Pakistani diplomat stressed that after 16 years of conflict, it is clear that lasting peace in Afghanistan can only be achieved through a comprehensive political process. ""Pakistan stands ready to work with Afghanistan and the United States to that end,"" he said.

This objective is not served when one country indulges in a vicious blame game against the other, the ambassador said. ""Incidentally, it is Pakistan -- not Afghanistan -- that has instituted strict border management measures to control cross-border movement. It is time we recognise that,"" he said.

He said terrorism incidents are on decline in Pakistan at a time when these incidents are on the rise in the rest of the world. ""Pakistan would not have achieved such success without conducting counterterrorism operations that were comprehensive and indiscriminate in scope,"" he added.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomacy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Raphel', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Robin Raphel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Boucher', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Richard Boucher'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Military intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_News_International', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The News International'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Muhammad'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Beijing'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Beijing'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'New Delhi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'New Delhi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Federally Administered Tribal Areas'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Federally Administered Tribal Areas'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Think tank'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Diplomat'}}]",https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2017-08-25/155178_093446_updates.jpg,eng-3382459,0.5294117647058822,241333200,1,geo.tv,news,GEO TV,"Donald Trump United States Pakistan Afghanistan Diplomacy Islamabad India Robin Raphel Richard Boucher Military intelligence War on Terror The News International Taliban Muhammad United States Secretary of State Terrorism Washington, D.C.

The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman has advised US President Donald Trump to find a political solution in Afghanistan by engaging the country's neighbours and negotiating with the Taliban rather than sending more troops to the war-torn country.

""Have a dialogue with Taliban and simultaneously withdraw US troops... the stated policy of killing the enemy is what they have been doing till now,"" Imran told the CNN on Thursday.

The conflict that began in October 2001 as a hunt for the 9/11 attackers has turned into a vexed effort to keep Afghanistan's divided and corruption-hindered democracy alive amid a brutal Taliban insurgency.

The PTI chief asked the Trump administration how additional troops could fulfill their objectives when ""the mightiest NATO forces"" could not do so by ""killing the enemy"" in Afghanistan.

In dealing with Trump, Pakistan plays its trump card

Announcing the deployment of thousands of more troops in Afghanistan On August 22, Trump lambasted Pakistan for harbouring ""agents of chaos, violence, and terror,"" saying the US could ""no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organisations"".

Imran deplored the statement, saying every Pakistani felt hurt and humiliated as Pakistan collaborated after 9/11 in US War on Terror and lost many precious lives.

Politicians react to Trump's remarks against Pakistan over Afghan policy

""By joining the US War on Terror, we lost some 70,000 people. Eighty per cent of the tribal people were rendered homeless and suddenly we have to hear this,"" Imran said.

Asked if Trump stopped civil and military aid to Pakistan, the PTI chief said it would be good for the country. ""I'd recommend we could be better off without the aid as this aid has been very costly to us,"" he said.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Democracy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'CNN'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'International Security Assistance Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Tribe'}}]",https://c.tribune.com.pk/2017/08/1490628-IMRAN-1503644638-191-640x480.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.5529411764705883,241345380,1,tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Donald Trump Pakistan Afghanistan Taliban Taliban insurgency Democracy CNN War on Terror International Security Assistance Force Terrorism Tribe,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,23,8,2017-08-25

He claimed that Pakistan has been the biggest collateral damage in the war in Afghanistan due its support for US War on Terror with an estimated 70,000 dead, and a hundred billion dollars lost in the economy, and at one time with 80% of the population in tribal areas composed of homeless IDPs.

Responding to former US Ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad's comments, Imran Khan has denied that the Government is informed about the location of terrorists, further going on to say that if Khalilzad seems to know that the roots of the terrorists are in Quetta and Peshawar, why have they not passed on the information to the Pakistani Government.

Khan questioned the plausibility of Trumps policy by saying that one of the mightiest military machines in the form of a hundred and fifty thousand strong NATO forces could not stop a small group of three thousand strong Haqqani group which Pakistan is being accused of harbouring.

Imran expressed that the Afghan Policy was ill though out, and had no proper political solution. He claimed that it was unjust to Pakistan to be blamed, since it was itself the biggest suffered of this war.

When asked about the withdrawal of US Aid, Khan recommended to the government that Pakistan could do without the aid, and that Pakistan is much better staying out of Afghanistan, since the aid is too costly in terms of loss of life.

National Action Plan was commended by Imran Khan, claiming that the legacy of the 80's has to end, and the political parties have come together to ensure that only the government has a monopoly over the arms.

In a message to Trump, Khan said that Trump's Afghanistan policy is flawed, and is more of the same.

In an interview to CNN's London-based anchor and correspondent Hala Gorani, Khan said that Pakistan, a country who collaborated with USA after 9/11 in war on terror, ended up in losing about more than 70,000 people and over a hundred billion dollars to the economy.

""After giving so much sacrifices and hearing that Pakistan has done nothing to stop terrorism is painful and humiliating for all the Pakistanis.

He said the tribal areas, adjoining Afghanistan, are hosting millions of internally displaced persons (IDPs).

Responding to a question regarding Former US Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad who said roots of terrorists are in Quetta, Khan said that if Khalilzad knows the hideouts of terrorists then why he didn't tell this to Pakistani government.

He asked is it plausible that there were hundred and fifty thousand NATO, and American troops in Afghanistan and they could not tackle small number of militants.

US cannot blame Pakistan for Afghanistan losses, he continued.

PTI chief said Pakistan has seen biggest collateral damage in this Afghan adventure, adding all the political parties in Pakistan came together and implemented National Action Plan (NAP) which is to disarm the terrorists.

In a message to Donald Trump, he said US policy regarding Afghanistan is flop and advised him to change it by engaging the neighbours (China, Russia and Iran).

He reiterated US should also leave Afghanistan because as long as they are in the country they will continue to create problems. Arrange a dialogue with Taliban, he demanded.

General Bajwa emphasised the need for effective border management along Pak-Afghan border and said Pakistan has taken effective measures on its side, including fencing and establishment of new border forts and posts.

The delegation of Afghan media personnel thanked the COAS for his time and candid discussion. They acknowledged that such interactions were useful to understand each other and they are carrying back home a facts-based positivity through this tour, the ISPR statement added.

This was stated by Foreign Office Spokesperson Nafees Zakaria at weekly news briefing in Islamabad on Friday.

The Spokesperson quoted many commanders and officials of the United States who paid visit to the areas where anti-terrorism operations were being held and had commended the consolidated efforts of Pakistan's security forces to counter terrorism.

He said Pakistan has a clear position on that, and it has taken indiscriminate action against terrorists.

The Spokesperson said the yesterday's National Security Committee's meeting vivifies Pakistan's stance on the US policy.

He reiterated Pakistan's stance that no other country has as much stake in a peaceful and stable Afghanistan as Pakistan has.

He said Pakistan remains committed to peace and stability in Afghanistan through an Afghan led and Afghan owned process.

Responding to a question, the Spokesperson said that Pakistan has clearly mentioned that India cannot be a net security provider in the South Asian region when it has conflictual relationships with all its neighbors and is pursuing a policy of destabilizing Pakistan.

""There are no safe havens for terrorists in Pakistan,"" he said. ""Pakistani soil is not being used for terrorist activities in Afghanistan,"" he added. General Bajwa said that efficient and proper border management between Pakistan and Afghanistan was the need of the hour. He said that Afghanistan was Pakistan's neighbour and brotherly Islamic country.

COAS emphasized the need for effective border management along Pak-Afghan border for which Pakistan has taken effective measures on its side of the border including fencing and establishment of new border forts / posts.

The Afghan media delegation thanked the Army Chief for his time and very candid discussion. They acknowledged that such interactions are very useful to understand each other and they are carrying back home a facts based positively through this tour.

The delegation is on week long visit to Pakistan in coordination with ISPR. The statement of the army chief comes in wake of United States President Donald Trump's harsh statement against Pakistan.

In his speech, Trump accused Pakistan of harbouring terrorists and criminals in safe havens that existed in the country. Trump's accusations evoked strong responses from the Foreign Office, Pakistan Army as well as civilian politicians of the country.

In an interview to a foreign TV channel Khan said that Pakistan, a country who collaborated with USA after 9/11 in war on terror, ended up in losing about more than 70,000 people and over a hundred billion dollars to the economy.

""After giving so much sacrifices and hearing that Pakistan has done nothing to stop terrorism is painful and humiliating for all the Pakistanis. He said the tribal areas, adjoining Afghanistan, are hosting millions of internally displaced persons (IDPs).

Responding to a question regarding Former US Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad who said roots of terrorists are in Quetta, Khan said that if Khalilzad knows the hideouts of terrorists then why he didn't tell this to Pakistani government.

He asked is it plausible that there were hundred and fifty thousand NATO, and American troops in Afghanistan and they could not tackle small number of militants. US cannot blame Pakistan for Afghanistan losses, he continued.

PTI chief said Pakistan has been biggest collateral damage in this Afghan adventure, adding all the political parties in Pakistan came together and implemented National Action Plan (NAP) which is to disarm the terrorists.

In a message to Donald Trump, he said US policy regarding Afghanistan is flop and advised him to change it by engaging the neighbours (China, Russia and Iran). He reiterated US should also leave Afghanistan because as long as they are in the country they will continue to create problems. Arrange a dialogue with Taliban, he demanded.

This was stated by Foreign Office Spokesperson Nafees Zakaria at weekly news briefing in Islamabad on Friday.

The Spokesperson quoted many commanders and officials of the United States who paid visit to the areas where anti-terrorism operations were being held and had commended the consolidated efforts of Pakistan's security forces to counter terrorism.

Responding to US President Donald Trump's criticism on Pakistan for ""housing the very terrorist Americans are fighting in the war-torn country,"" the Foreign Office spokesperson said that Pakistan has made sincere efforts for peace in the war-torn Afghanistan.

Zakaria said Pakistan's position on the neighbouring country is clear: ""It has sincerely striven for peaceful Afghanistan."" The international community, including America, had become aware of Pakistan's response to the American president's accusations, he added.

""No country in the world has rendered sacrifices more than Pakistan in the fight against terrorism,"" he said and reiterated Pakistan will continue to make efforts for bringing peace to the region.

Slamming Trump's request to India to play a greater role in stabilizing and developing Afghanistan, Zakaria said the country involved in state-sponsored terrorism cannot bring peace and stability in the region.

In India, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and other extremist outfits influencing the verdicts of courts, he said while expressing concern over the release of the culprits involved in Smjhota Express attack.

The Spokesperson said the Thursday's National Security Committee's meeting vivifies Pakistan's stance on the US policy. Responding to a question, the Spokesperson said that Pakistan has clearly mentioned that India cannot be a net security provider in the South Asian region when it has conflictual relationships with all its neighbors and is pursuing a policy of destabilizing Pakistan.

The Spokesperson said Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif intends to visit a number of countries but no dates have yet been finalized.

On Thursday, the meeting of National Security Committee was held in Islamabad with Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in chair to discuss the Trump Administration's South Asia Strategy. The committee observed that to scapegoat Pakistan will not help in stabilizing Afghanistan. In fact, being its immediate neighbor, Pakistan has an abiding interest in peace and stability in Afghanistan.

""Pakistan had to manage the blowback of a protracted conflict in Afghanistan that resulted in deluge of refugees, flow of drugs and arms and more recently in the shape of terrorist safe havens in eastern Afghanistan from where anti-Pakistan terrorist groups continue to operate and launch attacks inside Pakistan,"" the committee observed.

The fact remains that the complex issues and internal dynamics inside Afghanistan pose a grave challenge not only to Pakistan but to the broader region and the international community. While noting the US commitment to continue to shoulder the burden of Afghanistan and reverse the expanding ungoverned spaces in the country, the National Security Committee observed that Pakistan has consistently supported all international efforts for a stable and peaceful Afghanistan and has also committed more than a billion US dollars for infrastructure and social development in that country.

Over the years, Pakistan has worked with both the United States and Afghanistan to promote peace through a politically negotiated outcome which, in Pakistan's view, remains the best option to bring stability to this war torn country. A prolonged military campaign in Afghanistan has resulted in destruction and killing of hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians.

""It is Pakistan's expectation that any strategy adopted to stabilize Afghanistan will succeed to end this protracted conflict and usher in an era of peace in the country paving way for the dignified return of millions of Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan for which we are willing to extend all possible cooperation,"" the Foreign Office stated.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtriya_Swayamsevak_Sangh', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Extremism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Illegal drug trade'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_refugees', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan refugees'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Infrastructure'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United States dollar'}}]",http://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nafees-Zakaria.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.1058823529411764,241367340,1,thefrontierpost.com,news,The Frontier Post,Counter-terrorism Terrorism Islamabad Pakistan Afghanistan War on Terror Donald Trump Foreign and Commonwealth Office India Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh Extremism International community South Asia Presidency of Donald Trump Khawaja Muhammad Asif Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Illegal drug trade Refugee Foreign minister Afghan refugees Infrastructure United States dollar,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,29,14,2017-08-25

The number of US air strikes in Afghanistan has already dramatically spiked since Trump took office in January; from 1,074 in all of last year to 2,244 as of August 20 this year.

After a months-long review of his Afghanistan policy, Trump committed the United States last week to an open-ended conflict in the country and promised a stepped-up campaign against the Taliban insurgents.

Few details have emerged, but the pilots in Bagram are preparing for the possibility they'll be taking the fight to the Taliban in a way they haven't since the US-led ""combat mission"" in Afghanistan was called off at the end of 2014.

Among their targets since then have been Islamic State militants, who are also active in the country.

""Between the two groups, the Taliban are definitely smarter,"" F-16 pilot Major Daniel Lindsey told Reuters. ""The Taliban are much harder to kill.""

While Islamic State has launched a series of deadly attacks around the country, it has nowhere near the influence, reach and community ties that the Taliban have.

It's those factors that pilots say make the Taliban a more challenging target, and one that has outlasted years of heavy bombardment.

""The Taliban are often embedded in the community, but nobody likes the Islamic State, so they are often separate,"" Lindsey said.

New parameters

In many ways, Trump's policy is less a new plan than the continuation of a slow slide back into combat for American troops, although officials are quick to say their mission will remain focused on training and advising Afghan forces.

On Thursday, the commander of US troops in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, confirmed that his forces would increase air support for Afghan troops.

""We know the enemy fears air power,"" he told reporters in Kabul.

White House officials have said that rolling back territorial gains by the Taliban will be one of the key objectives of the new strategy.

For a time after former president Barack Obama declared America's combat mission over in Afghanistan at the end of 2014, US forces were restricted from attacking the Taliban in most circumstances except self-defence.

As the group expanded its hold in Afghanistan, however, Obama began to loosen some of those rules and Trump has gone further in sending US troops back into battle with their old adversaries.

Asked about the recent effects of US air strikes, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the group's fighters had become used to dodging American bombs.

""In 2010, 2011 and 2012 the US air strikes were successful and we lost many Mujahideen,"" he told Reuters. ""But now we have enough experience to avoid casualties during their strikes by hiding in mountain holes and other places.""

Still, forcing the Taliban to hide and preventing them from massing fighters has in some cases been credited with helping Afghan security forces hold on to some cities and blunt Taliban offensives.

Expanding strikes

Trump also announced that he would ""lift restrictions and expand authorities in the field,"" but it remains unclear exactly what that would entail.

A US military spokesman in Kabul, Captain William Salvin, said US forces are still limited to conducting air strikes in three broad circumstances: self-defence, counter-terrorism strikes against specific groups, and helping Afghan troops achieve ""strategic effects"".

He declined to say whether those parameters might change.

The US military does not publicise its rules of engagement, but Lindsey said compared to when he was a fighter pilot at the height of the troop surge in Iraq in 2007, the so-called ""ROE"" in Afghanistan were less restrictive.

""Some guys can complain about it, but most I know don't seem to have any problem finding Islamic State or Taliban to kill,"" he said. ""If you use the rules smartly, you'll get the bad guys.""

The surge in air strikes has led the US Air Force units at Bagram to increase their maintenance and intelligence efforts, said F-16 pilot Maj. Abraham Lehman.

Officials say ramping up the number of strikes further would require the deployment of more support staff as well as additional specialised troops on the ground to coordinate the strikes.

While he said he had no information on new plans to deploy additional aircraft, Lehman said it ""made sense"" to increase air support as the Pentagon sends thousands more troops to the country.

""What we do is always a joint effort between us and the ground troops,"" Lehman said.","[{'uri': 'reuters@nation.com.pk', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Fighter pilot'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_warfare', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Aerial warfare'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Airstrike'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagram', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bagram'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Bagram'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Army'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Reuters'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan National Security Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabiullah_Mujahid', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Zabiullah Mujahid'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_engagement', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rules of engagement'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_air_support', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Close air support'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Mujahideen'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'White House'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Military intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Air Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'The Pentagon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Iraq'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iraq'}}}]",http://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2017-08-25/us-fighter-pilots-in-afghanistan-prepare-for-more-air-strikes-1503685727-5450.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.05098039215686279,241382340,1,nation.com.pk,news,The Nation,Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Fighter pilot Aerial warfare Taliban Airstrike Afghanistan Donald Trump United States Armed Forces Afghan Armed Forces Taliban insurgency Bagram Afghan National Army General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon Reuters Barack Obama Kabul Afghan National Security Forces Zabiullah Mujahid Rules of engagement Close air support Mujahideen Counter-terrorism White House Military intelligence United States Air Force The Pentagon Iraq,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,39,18,2017-08-25

The government would soon hold consultations before announcing the schedule of the conference, source said, adding that all important countries would be invited to the moot where Islamabad would reaffirm its commitment to terror fight and recount the colossal losses it has suffered thus far.

In the meantime, Islamabad will mount a diplomatic offensive to muster support of friendly countries in the face of Trump's allegations that Pakistan was hosting terrorist 'safe havens' on its soil.

In dealing with Trump, Pakistan plays its trump card

Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif and his other cabinet members will be touring important world capitals. Asif is expected to travel to China, Russia and even Iran before flying to Washington to voice Pakistan's concerns to the Trump administration.

Islamabad will raise its reservations about the new US policy for Afghanistan at the United Nations and other international forums.

The country's top civil leadership and military brass have unanimously made it clear to the US administration that scapegoating Pakistan for the unabated violence in Afghanistan would not help in stabilising the war-torn country.

Trump in his policy speech this week committed to an 'open ended' military engagement in Afghanistan to win the war against the Taliban. Pakistani officials, however, believe peace is only possible through dialogue and reconciliation.

Pakistan has been pushing for reactivating the Quadrilateral Coordination Group that comprises Pakistan, China, Afghanistan and the United States, which has been dormant after Kabul's reluctance to involve Islamabad in the reconciliation process.

""Despite President Trump's blistering criticism of Pakistan, there is no visible diplomatic tension between the two countries and the ties remain unaffected,"" a source told Daily Express.

Sources said Pakistani officials have told the Americans that the administrations of Ashraf Ghani and Donald Trump will have to dismantle the sanctuaries of Pakistani Taliban terrorists on the Afghan soil.

Russia warns Trump against piling up pressure on Pakistan

Islamabad says that Pakistani Taliban use the Afghan soil as a springboard for launching deadly attacks inside Pakistan. Almost all major terrorist attacks have been traced to Afghanistan.

Sources said both Kabul and Washington have assured Pakistan that action would be taken against these terrorists. Sources also said that the new Pakistan policy would call for an end to an unending demand of 'do more' from Washington.

And this would be conveyed to the Trump administration by the foreign minister during his forthcoming visit. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson invited Khawaja Asif earlier this month to visit Washington.

The US allegations of sheltering terrorists are not new. And the Pakistani officialdom believes Trump has repeated these allegations to appease India with which its diplomatic romance is growing, according to sources.

Pakistani strategists say both India and the United States are not happy with the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that has been dubbed 'game changer' for the entire region.

President Trump's allegations are part of the American strategy to pile pressure on Pakistan to find a scapegoat for its military failure in Afghanistan, sources said.

China and Russia have criticised Trump's attempt to build up pressure on Pakistan. And diplomatic sources believe Washington would try to ease tensions triggered by Trump's allegations because it could not afford to estrange Islamabad.","[{'uri': 'daily_express@tribune.com.pk', 'name': 'Daily Express', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Express', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Daily Express'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Presidency of Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cabinet (government)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}]",https://c.tribune.com.pk/2017/08/1491369-image-1503697741-544-640x480.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.1215686274509804,241394460,1,tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,"Donald Trump Islamabad Pakistan Afghanistan Khawaja Muhammad Asif War on Terror Daily Express Terrorism Karachi Presidency of Donald Trump Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan Taliban Cabinet (government) United Nations Foreign minister Federal government of the United States Washington, D.C.

US President Donald Trump delivered his much awaited address outlining the 'new' US strategy on Afghanistan. In a halting and stuttering manner, he displayed a total reversal of his long-held objection to the very idea of having a US military presence in the country. Trump's rationale was that ""decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the oval office. In other words, when you are president of the United States. He claims that he has studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. His contention was that after many meetings over many months, he held his final meeting on August 18 at Camp David with his cabinet and generals to complete the US strategy. It is surprising that on the eve of Trump's huddle at Camp David, he sacked his chief strategist Steve Bannon.

As Trump unveiled his 'strategy', it became evident that by announcing another troop surge of US forces in Afghanistan without a defined timeline for their departure, or the methodology of their deployment or how he expects to deliver on his promise of winning the war; his mangled and obscured policy was an assertion that his strategy was to have no publicly-stated strategy at all.

The government is focusing on saving the ousted Prime Minister and his family from corruption cases being filed against them, thus little or no attention has been paid to Trump's uncalled for admonitions

Trump's typical stance of taking 180Â° turns on nearly all his election campaign promises continues. It has become apparent that in a quixotic manner, the US President is tilting against windmills when he declares ""We are not nation-building again, we are killing terrorists.""

Trump pilloried Pakistan, stating that in the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. The two militaries have worked together against common enemies. Acknowledging that the Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism, he stated that the US recognises those contributions and those sacrifices, but warned that Pakistan has also sheltered the same organisations that try every single day to kill Americans. He claimed that the US has been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars, and at the same time Pakistan is housing the terrorists that the US is fighting. He claimed that no partnership can survive a country's harboring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. He asserted that it is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order, and to peace. Without stating the coercive steps that will be taken to pressurise Pakistan, he simply fired broadsides against Pakistan.

Pakistan has been rattled by the shots fired by Trump across its bow. The government is focusing on saving the ousted Prime Minister and his family from the corruption cases being filed against them, thus little or no attention has been paid to Trump's uncalled for admonitions. Once again filling the vacuum, the Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had to spell out to the US Ambassador to Islamabad, David Hale: ""Pakistan does not want material or financial assistance from the US, but needs to be trusted and treated with respect,"" when the latter called on him at Rawalpindi.

In fact Trump, while appreciating India's important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, asserting that India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, demanded that the US wants India to help more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. Trump gave the kiss of death to Modi and his cronies, when he pronounced India to be a strategic partner of the US in Afghanistan. The Taliban will now perceive India to be its arch enemy in tandem with the US and will feel justified in targeting Indians in Afghanistan. India prides on being called a sovereign state but Trump has identified US relationship with India as transactional. That is most deriding that India has been asked to ""do more"" along with Pakistan. India hated being affixed with Af-Pak but now it will have to face the ignominy of becoming the suffix to ""Af-Pak-India"".

The US president should realise that Pakistan too has a number of arrows in its quiver, which can be fired when required. Pakistan had once blocked the crucial supply line for the US-led NATO forces in 2011 in the wake of killing of its 24 soldiers by US forces near the Pak-Afghan border at Salala check post. Pakistan can choke the Ground Lines of Communication and block the logistic supply to its troops in Afghanistan. Trump would be better served not to scapegoat Pakistan but give it due respect.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Oval Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Camp David'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistanis', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistanis'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Steve Bannon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-building', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nation-building'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cabinet (government)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Political corruption'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Javed_Bajwa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Qamar Javed Bajwa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hale_(diplomat)', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'David Hale (diplomat)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Civilization'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Coercion'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rawalpindi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Rawalpindi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Scapegoat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'International Security Assistance Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereign state'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Logistics'}}]",http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/05463180e0491a3ebf15a51b1da7ca67.jpg ,eng-3382459,0.0117647058823529,241398660,1,dailytimes.com.pk,news,Daily Times,Oval Office Donald Trump Terrorism United States Pakistan Afghanistan Camp David Pakistanis Steve Bannon Nation-building Cabinet (government) Political corruption United States Armed Forces India Qamar Javed Bajwa David Hale (diplomat) Civilization Taliban Coercion Islamabad Rawalpindi Scapegoat International Security Assistance Force Sovereign state Logistics,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,25,11,23,2017-08-25

These words by the US President during his address to the nation on August 21, 2017, from Fort Myer military base in Arlington, are indicative of America's plans regarding South Asia.

Trump's speech could possibly send US-Pakistan relations into further unease and apprehension. President Trump's war policy against Pakistan is bold and high handed. Pursuing such a strategy both in the long and short term will not bode well for Washington-Islamabad ties. Despite Pakistan enjoying pleasant relations with the US during the pre-9/11 era - particularly during the 1960s and 70s - the post-9/11 era saw the US enter into a challenging eradue to differences with Pakistan over policies and geopolitical strategies. Afghanistan, thereafter, became the cause of major disagreements.

Importantly, President Trump put forward his policy regarding Indiacalling it to play a greater role in Afghanistan. Inviting India into the US-Afghanistan-Pakistan equation can only spell a regional disaster. Even if India keeps a one-on-one relation with Afghanistan, it will affect Pak-Afghan ties in one way or the other. Pakistan cannot face another regional disturbance, especially with Afghanistan, as the spillover effect of refugees from Afghanistan into Pakistan and terrorist factions operating from Afghanistan have greatly affected Pakistan's internal peace and security. If India's presence in Afghanistan increases, they might use Kabul to interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs and further deteriorate Islamabad's ties with both Kabul and New Delhi.

President Trump's speech clearly indicates at Americas concern regarding Pakistan's nuclear program. Their apprehension is palpable as previous, US governments under George W. Bush and Barack Obama hinted at the need to secure Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. Furthermore, during his speech, Donald Trump stated , ""Pakistan often gives safe havens to agents of chaos, violence, and terror. The threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict. And that could happen.""

US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, just a day after President Trump delivered his speech, laid out a clear directive on behalf of the US administration's opinion regarding Pakistan's alleged support for the Haqqani extremists and for the Afghan Taliban. Tillerson was of the view that a stable Pakistan is what interests the US. Moreover, Tillerson stated how the US could pressurize Pakistan in achieving its objectives. Among the many ways, two major ones included reconsidering Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO US ally and withholding military aid.

Will Islamabad put itself in Washington's good books by 'doing more' or will President Trump's administration remain adamant at focusing on Pakistan's inability to counter terrorism and have its eyes set on guarding Islamabad's nuclear arsenal?

In the recent past, the US has expressed its desire to work with Pakistan. Washington is moving forward to support Kabul in the battle against Taliban; however, Pakistan's purported alliance with such militant wings has put Islamabad under the US radar. It may put US-Pakistan relations into fragile ground. The Pakistan government, therefore, must find a diplomatic path and a long-term solution to this predicament.

During his speech, President Trump said, ""We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities. Conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables, will guide our strategy from now on. America's enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out."" However, in February 2017, the commander of the American-led international military force in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, while addressing the Senate Armed Services Committee told the need to deploy a few thousand troops in Afghanistan to train Afghan soldiers. Deploying US troops in Afghanistan will create tension in the region and especially between Afghanistan-Pakistan and US-Pakistan ties now that the new foreign policy under President Donald Trump will be more stringent and tougher than ever before. President Trump has stated his policies; Afghanistan will remain a battleground while the impact of United States' ties with Afghanistan and India will affect Pakistan. Will Islamabad put itself in Washington's good books by 'doing more' or will President Trump's administration remain adamant at focusing on Pakistan's inability to counter terrorism and have its eyes set on guarding Islamabad's nuclear arsenal? Time will tell how US-Pakistan ties will change because their ties are already shifting.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear weapon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_County,_Virginia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Arlington County, Virginia'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Arlington County, Virginia'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Geopolitics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Refugee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear program of Iran'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'George W.

Speaking to a nine-member delegation of Afghan media, the army chief said that terrorists are the common enemy of all against which a trust-based coordinated response is required rather than blame game, according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR)

General Bajwa said that Pakistan Army had conducted operations against militants and terrorists without any discrimination.

""There are no safe havens for terrorists in Pakistan nor is Pakistani soil being used for terrorist activities inside Afghanistan,"" he told the visiting delegation.

General Bajwa said that efficient and proper border management between Pakistan and Afghanistan was the need of the hour. He emphasized the need for an effective management system along Pak-Afghan border for which Pakistan has taken effective measures on its side including fencing and establishment of new border forts and posts.

US President Trump has wrongly held Pakistan responsible for retarding US victory in Afghanistan which is a result of wrong priorities and flawed decisions by their own government, it said.

A VOP statement, issued here, said that statements of Trump and some other top US officials are the total negation of the ground realities as Pakistan has done more against terrorism than any other country and remains a target of terrorism that is being controlled from Afghanistan and India.

The veterans said that Mr Trump has tried to hide weaknesses of his administration by making Pakistan a scapegoat as has made no mention about Mulla Fazlullah, who is controlling the TTP's terrorism in Pakistan from Afghanistan.

The US president has also ignored Indian agent Kalbhushan, who has confessed involvement in terrorist activities in Pakistan. On the other hand, America has labelled the people of Indian-held-Kashmir as terrorists just because they are struggling for their rights granted by the UN Security Council.

The USA has never been happy with Pakistan's nuclear programme, whereas it is going full throttle to support India's nuclear programme. Kerry Lugar Bill and India's inclusion in Nuclear Suppliers Group is a wide open example. Trump should have supported Pakistan's efforts to build a fence along the border to check unauthorised crossing and should have offered latest electronic equipment to improve vigilance.

Pakistan's reaction to Trump's unreasonable statement left much to be desired, the government must assert that it cannot compromise on its sovereignty. As regards dollars, Pakistan has given back much more by helping the USA to win the Cold War. People have now started regretting that decision.

The VOP members have no doubt in their minds that the US is not in Afghanistan for the sake of democracy but to target Pakistan's growing relations with China and CPEC. This was clearly told by senior foreign policy adviser to the US State Department, Dr Walter Russell Mead, when he met members of the VOP in 2010.","[{'uri': 'sasaeed_ahmed@thenews.com.pk', 'name': 'SASaeed Ahmed', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Southern United States'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism in Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Scapegoat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Suppliers_Group', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear Suppliers Group'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'John Kerry'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereignty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Russell_Mead', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Walter Russell Mead'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Cold War'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Department of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Democracy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}]",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2017-08-26/l_226080_042555_print.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.4509803921568627,241402740,1,thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,Donald Trump Terrorism United States Pakistan Afghanistan Asia Southern United States India Terrorism in Pakistan Scapegoat South Asia Nuclear Suppliers Group United Nations Security Council John Kerry Sovereignty Walter Russell Mead Cold War United States Department of State Democracy Foreign policy China,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center-right,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,26,19,0,2017-08-26

According to Bloomberg, ""Trump's new strategy to turn around the 16-year conflict in Afghanistan will probably falter for a reason few of his voters would realize: China. Trump publicly tried to pressure Pakistan ..... But this aspect of the Afghan strategy is likely to founder because of China's increasingly close economic ties with Pakistan, which reduces American leverage.""

With more than $50 billion in planned infrastructure projects and strong diplomatic support for its positions, American threats to withdraw billions in military aid are becoming less worrying for the powerful army, which dominates foreign policy.

""China is the shield now,"" said Harsh Pant, an international relations professor at King's College London. ""The more aid America will cut, Pakistan will be expecting China to fill the vacuum.""

Pakistan has long denied it harbours terrorists. China's support for its ally means Pakistan doesn't need to alter course.

The Forbes magazine criticized Pakistan by citing the April 17 issue of Current History: ""Nonetheless, America continued to scale up its support for Pakistan for many more years. More than fifteen years have passed since the United States launched operations in Afghanistan, ostensibly with the support of Pakistan,"" notes Fair. ""During this period, the Americans scaled up and then scaled down troop deployments and investments in Afghanistan's economy, infrastructure, civil society, and armed forces, but never managed to deal with the simple fact that, throughout this war, they have depended on one country that was steadfastly opposed to US and NATO objectives: Pakistan.""

That's good news for India that now has America on its side in its efforts to maintain influence in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to contain China in its northern border.

Meanwhile, America's major policy shift in the region couldn't come at a worse time for Pakistan's equity markets, which have already been suffering hefty losses from corruption scandals that brought down the Sharif government.

According to Washington Post, President Trump said: ""Today, 20 US-designated foreign terrorist organizations are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- the highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world.""

A presidential address to the nation is usually carefully vetted for factual accuracy. That's not always the case for President Trump's speeches, but extra care appeared to have been taken for his speech on the strategy on Afghanistan. Still, this number -- 20 US-designated foreign terrorist organizations in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- jumped out at us. It seemed rather high. Where did this number come from?

The Facts: The secretary of state designates foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs), and Trump's phrasing suggested that he was referring to the list of FTOs maintained by the State Department. But when we asked the White House where this number came from, an official pointed to congressional testimony by Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of US Central Command. But here's the problem: The State Department only lists 13 FTOs as active in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with one (Hizbul Mujahideen) being added just last week.

Indeed, the White House sent us a list of 20 purported terrorist organizations that were designated, and only 12 were on the official State Department list.

As far we can tell, the only source for this statistic is Gen. John W. Nicholson, the US commander in Afghanistan. In interviews, news briefings and congressional testimony, he has repeatedly said that ""of the 98 US designated terrorist groups globally, 20 are in the AF/PAK region."" His statements have then turned up in news reports, such as in the New York Times.

So where did Nicholson get his figure? His spokesman, Navy Capt. William K. Salvin, said that he added entities designated by the Treasury Department and State Department as providing financial support to terror groups under Executive Order (EO) 13224, issued by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks.

But adding together FTOs and EO designations really mixes apples and oranges, as some of the EO designations are for providing support to terrorist groups instead of being a terrorist group itself. That's the reason the State Department has the legal authority to designate foreign terrorist organizations, and why the FTO list is considered the gold standard.

The total number of FTOs designated by the State Department is 62, not 98. We asked for further clarification from the White House but did not get a reply. The White House really needs to do a better job of quality control for important speeches. Rather than rely on a statistic ginned up by a field commander, someone should have called the State Department and double-checked whether it was valid to use this figure.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump's new strategy face a potential challenge because of the rising fortunes of Imran Khan, a popular politician, a fierce critic of the US policy, who maintains that Pakistan's anti-terror alliance caused destruction in Pakistan and gave rise to violence. .

Former US ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, wrote in the New York Times, advising Trump to show an unflagging commitment to the cause and be prepared to respond to moves by adversaries to disrupt his plan. He said the president must be ready for Pakistan to resist and test his resolve. This might come in the form of attacks on American assets in Afghanistan or of interference with supply routes across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Pakistan's security apparatus will try to prove that the United States cannot succeed without cooperating on Islamabad's terms.

A major change from the Obama era is Trump's decision to give American commanders in the field the flexibility they've long sought in assisting the Afghan forces fighting the Taliban and other insurgents. The president also adopted a realistic position regarding peace talks, moving away from President Barack Obama's pursuit of reconciliation regardless of the deteriorating military situation.

In another write-up, The News York Times says Pakistani officials have cited Indian influence as a primary cause of instability and insecurity in Afghanistan. Officials in Islamabad accuse India of supporting a hostile political regime in Kabul and funding militants, who use Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks inside Pakistan.

Pakistani officials said they expected private contractors to take a more dominant role than troops already in Afghanistan. Senior Pakistani security officials stress that an all-inclusive engagement is the only option for peace inside Afghanistan. More troops inside the country, along with blaming Pakistan for harboring terrorists, will not work, they said in background interviews.

Sehar Kamran, an opposition senator who leads an Islamabad-based think tank, said Mr. Trump's plan appeared to be ""more of the same, under much more colorful language and contradictory bluster.""

Ms. Kamran said that pushing India to play a stronger role inside Afghanistan would isolate Washington's friends in Islamabad ""without realizing, understanding or perhaps deliberately underestimating the impact of increasing Indian presence on Pakistan's western border.""

""An unnecessary flexing of military muscles and the deployment of additional troops at this time will only undo much that has been achieved over many years diplomatically, and serve to further antagonize regional countries like Pakistan, China and Russia,"" she said.

""Pakistan is prepared to absorb the impact of a more assertive US policy toward the country,"" said Arif Rafiq, a nonresident fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. ""It's the most economically stable that it's been in a decade, thanks in part to massive Chinese investment, and it has managed to secure much of its border regions despite the withdrawal of most US combat forces.""

He said that Pakistan also knows that it has several options to counter punitive actions by Washington, including closing supply routes to Afghanistan.

James Stavridis, former US admiral and supreme commander of Nato allied forces, wrote in Foreign Policy Magazine: The options are bad in Afghanistan. We could cut our losses (2,400 Americans dead, $1 trillion spent) and depart -- but that would eventually lead to another Vietnam moment, with helicopters lifting off the roof of the US Embassy. Another approach would be to return to a robust NATO-led operation with 150,000 troops doing the actual fighting, which was the size of the force when I ran the Afghan war as supreme allied commander in 2009-2013. But there is no appetite for that level of commitment on either side of the Atlantic, and, frankly, the entire world wrestles with profound Afghan fatigue.""

He said: The new strategy is hardly new, and sometimes the best Plan B is to work harder and smarter at Plan A. Kudos to the president's generals for landing him on a glide path that makes strategic and tactical sense, albeit an option that is merely the least worst next move in the long-running great game of Afghanistan.

According to CNN, Trump has always insisted he's all about winning. But on Monday night, as he laid out his new strategy for Afghanistan, America got to see how its new President confronted what many experts believe is a no-win situation: a war that has dragged on with no end in sight for 16 years. Trump declares US will 'win' in Afghanistan, but gives few details. Trump laced his prime-time speech with volleys of bold language that might be expected from a new commander-in-chief taking over a failing war. His plans hardly seem sufficiently sweeping to unlock the victory that eluded Presidents George W. Bush and Obama in a nation that is treacherous for foreign invaders.

They are also unlikely to significantly change calculations among Taliban leaders and in Pakistan's military.

Chicago Tribune said: The speech was a model of bold phrases and grand promises unsupported by any specifics that would indicate the president has any idea how to make his vision into reality. It doesn't tell us much when Trump makes declarations such as, ""We will push onward to victory. He thinks loosening the restrictions on how our forces fight will make a big difference. But those restrictions are designed to minimize civilian casualties -- partly because killing innocents unnecessarily is morally wrong and partly because it antagonizes Afghans, thus increasing the number of people willing to fight against us.

Trump also claims he will force Pakistan to stop providing a safe haven for the Taliban, extract more economic aid from India and persuade our NATO allies to up their involvement in the war. This is not a plan; it's a letter to Santa Claus.

Pakistan has vital interests at stake that take precedence over ours -- not to mention leverage that has made it largely impervious to the demands of American presidents. The United States, reports Reuters, ""has no choice but to use Pakistani roads to resupply its troops in landlocked Afghanistan. US officials worry that if Pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilize Afghanistan and endanger US soldiers.""

India is not about to let Washington dictate its policy toward a neighbour -- and more Indian involvement would worsen our relations with Pakistan. Trump has done nothing to make our allies in Europe want to knock themselves out on our behalf.

Trump indulged in such fierce, uncompromising rhetoric for an obvious reason: to distract Americans from how puny his plan is and how meager his goals. He promises victory, but all he can realistically hope to do is stave off defeat -- at the cost of more American lives and $25 billion a year.

According to Los Angeles Times, citing analysts isolating Pakistan could unsettle the US relationship with Islamabad and push it closer to Russia, China and Iran, further complicating efforts to stabilize the region.

""The idea of US leverage in Pakistan is deeply exaggerated,"" Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the US-based Wilson Center's Asia Program, said in an email to The Associated Press a day after Trump's speech. ""No matter the punishment, policy, or inducement, there's little reason to believe that Pakistan will change its ways.""

According to an analysis in The Guardian, ""instead of maintaining a policy of careful diplomacy, the US president's attack on the country has gifted China greater influence in an unstable region. ... This is a serious strategic mistake.""

The Economist said: ""It will still remain difficult for America to reach a point where it can claim success in Afghanistan. Mr Trump's insistence that he is not in the business of nation-building is all very well. But without progress by the dysfunctional Afghan government towards delivering security and basic services, the Taliban will retain support in the Pushtun south and east of the country. Nor is there much prospect of enlisting the help of Afghanistan's neighbours.""

A report in The Diplomat said: China seems to be the only nation that dare to defend Pakistan against the United States. What's interesting is that Pakistan's attitude shifted to high-profile after Pakistan gained China's ""strong support"" after Trump's speech. Later on August 22, Pakistan's foreign ministry published another emotional and lengthy statement to fire back at the US.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Department of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'White House'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Infrastructure'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Bloomberg L.P.'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'The New York Times'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Karachi'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Executive order (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Votel', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Joseph Votel'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmay_Khalilzad', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Zalmay Khalilzad'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College_London"", 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""King's College London""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hizbul_Mujahideen', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hizbul Mujahideen'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Durand Line'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Imran Khan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Central Command'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Civil society'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Department of the Treasury'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Forbes'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Gold standard'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Political corruption'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'The Washington Post'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International relations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Navy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'George W.

The leaders on the occasion not only condemned the recent statement of US president but termed it stabbing in back of Pakistan despite major sacrifices in war against terrorism.

Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen Pakistan (MWM) Karachi chapter staged protest demonstration after the Friday prayers outside the Imambargh Khardar Karachi. The participants of the demo were carrying placards and banners inscribed with slogans against US president Donald John Trump. They chanted slogans against US president and also burn American flags to express their anger.

Addressing the protesters, MWM leaders Allama Ahmed Iqbal, Ali Hussain Naqvi, Moulana Azhar Naqvi said that Trump in his recent statement has confirmed that his policies were against actually against Pakistan despite of major sacrifices in war against terrorism.

They termed USA most danger state which is working against the Muslims across the world while the time has arrived Pakistan should get rid of a fake friend which has remained intact with country since long to get its personal gain.

They said earlier US engaged Pakistan in its war to destabilise the country while now both US and India were planning to provide smooth path to world terrorist organization Daesh inside Pakistan. They said that everyone is aware with the wicked polices of USA as it initially under the banner of peace killed innocent people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and other Muslims states. US not only destroyed these countries but provided complete support to Taliban and Daesh. USA financially supports these terrorists' organizations and using them against the Muslims across the world to defame Islam globally, they added.

MWM leaders said practicing wicked polices against Pakistan would result as a big mistake for USA as it would open the path of destruction for USA itself. The nation is untied and stood shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan Armed forces they said and urged Pak-army to deal with situation bravely and confidently.

Similarly, Difa-e-Pakistan Council also staged a demonstration outside the Karachi Press Club to condemn the recent statement of the US President. Larger number of people carrying Pakistan flags, banners and placards inscribed with slogans against USA President participate in the demonstration. They condemned the US president statement and chanted slogans in favor of Pakistan Armed forces.

Mili Muslim League Pakistan leader Muzamil Iqbal Hashmi, Jammat-e-Islami Muslim Pervaiz, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (S) Qazi Ahmed Noorani, Jamait Ulema Pakistan Abdul Haleem, Jamaat-Ud-Dawa Abdul Azeem, PST Matloob Awan, MUM Abdul Khaliq and others attended the protest demo.

Addressing the participants the speakers said that Pakistan gave endless sacrifices against the terrorism while USA moving on its old policies has once again disregarded all the efforts and work done by Pakistan. Rulers should take this matter seriously and bring down the relationship with USA at bottom along with a rapid response to the president Donald John Trump.

They said that quick response of China in this regard is admirable and we are proud of the Pak-China friendship. Whereas the world should recognize the real face of USA and it is which is responsible for the terrorism across the world, they added.

The speakers on the occasion pointed out that USA never responded as friend of Pakistan and at the time of East-Pakistan war it delayed to send its aircraft carrier. US never wanted progress of Pakistan and always worked to destabilize country.

Praising the sacrifices of Pakistan Armed forces they said that Chief of Army Staff has responded good in this regard and given a clear message to the opponents which reflects as the real voice of Pakistani Nation. Meanwhile, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Karachi chief Engr Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman on Friday strictly criticised the United States President Donald Trump for his controversial statement against Pakistan.

In a statement, he said that the US herself is the greatest terrorist in this world. He said that US's CIA and other operatives have been harboring terrorists and using them in Balochistan, FATA, Karachi and other areas.

He was of the view that the US policy makers needs to know that the US policies have been creating unrest in the world and are directly responsible for terrorism across the globe.

Engr Naeem said that Pakistan has been rendering huge sacrifices in this so-called war against terrorism but those responsible for this terrorism are criticizing the country. He also demanded of the government and state institutions to review their existing policies and devise a comprehensive foreign policy, ensuring the interests of Pakistan.

Criticising the government, he said that the Pakistan's foreign policy have badly been failed. He said that the Pakistani nation is united against any potential threat. He urged the government to reply the Trump led US government in the same tone and intensity it used against the country.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person',

PRESIDENT Donald Trump's much touted Afghan strategy -- which is a U-turn on his original views -- is essentially a facelift of a tried, tested and failed formula. It is a surge, of sorts, backed by a rap on the knuckles for Pakistan (which remains an abiding and favourite scapegoat for US failures in Afghanistan). It is a sop to India, more symbolic than substantive. And it gives carte blanche to the military to pursue what is now an unwinnable war without end against a faceless and stateless enemy.

Pakistanis would critique the Afghan strategy of President Trump on three counts. First, 16 years and $1 trillion later, what can 4000 more American troops do which over 100,000 American troops could not achieve? Second, injecting India into Afghanistan -- whom Pakistan accuses of using Afghan territory to foment violence in Pakistan's border regions -- is a sure recipe for a Pakistan-India proxy war on Afghanistan soil.

Third, with no military solution in sight for Afghanistan, regional diplomacy, involving Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia, is more in need than anything listed above. Although President Trump has said that he recognizes the ""contributions and sacrifices"" of the Pakistani people who have ""suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism,"" he has also accused Pakistan of ""continuing to harbour criminals and terrorists.""

Such talk is counter-productive, given the Pakistani people's sacrifices (over 60,000 soldiers and civilians dead) and the fact that Pakistan today is probably the only Muslim country to have waged a successful anti-terror fight. As a pivotal regional player, Pakistan today has greater room for manoeuvre in foreign policy. Pakistan has a close rapport with China and Russia as well as the Central Asian republics, serving as the hub of a growing regional economic connectivity. And US clout and leverage is much diminished today.

With Modi's India divided and polarised -- and bogged down in problems with neighbours like China, Nepal and Myanmar -- Pakistan has strategic space in which it can operate. Despite all the above, Pakistan can see a small glimmer of hope. President Trump has clearly spelled out his definition of victory in Afghanistan, which he reduces to ""preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan."" So when President Trump talks of an ""honourable and enduring outcome,"" it is similar to President Nixon's ""peace with honour"" mantra just before exiting Vietnam.

Moreover, Trump, for the first time, has put the onus on the Afghan government, stating ""our commitment is not unlimited and our support is not a blank check,"" and the ""government of Afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden"" adding, he is looking for ""real reforms, real progress, and real results,"" plus warning Kabul that America's ""patience is not unlimited.""

There is also a new emphasis on the economic dimension as part of the overall diplomatic and military strategy towards Afghanistan. This was made clear when Trump talked about India. He said that it ""makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan especially in the area of economic assistance and development.""

Having taken this long to formulate what is essentially new wine in an old bottle, the politician in President Trump probably saw an opportunity to score some points with his domestic audience while announcing a foreign policy -- something he has struggled to do in the past. Unlike Russia, where he has refused to be critical of Putin, on Afghanistan, he has conveniently conformed to the traditional position of the American security establishment.Trump's Afghanistan plan

Apart from sharing the American Establishment worldview on Afghanistan, he has also outsourced the war to his generals and commanders in the field where he has made it clear that there will be no ""micro-management from Washington DC"" and that he has already ""lifted restrictions placed by the previous administration on action to be taken in the battlefield"". By handing over responsibility to the military, should the outcome be negative, Trump feels he will escape the blame or the consequences of defeat.

With little over 40% of Afghanistan already under the influence or control of the Taliban, according to the most recent quarterly report to the United States Congress from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), Trump's war rhetoric is a throwback to the last days of the Vietnam War, when President Nixon resorted to the Christmas Bombing of Hanoi in December 1972 with the intention to bring the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong to the conference table. Very soon, the realization will dawn on President Trump that the road to peace in Kabul lies through Islamabad, and Islamabad will be ready for the call that will come from Washington seeking a helping hand to extricate the United States from the Afghan quagmire.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}},

"" A trust-based coordinated response is required against terrorists who are the common enemies of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and the regional media can play a vital role in mitigating the negativity created by such hostile forces,"" said Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Friday while meeting a delegation of media persons from Afghanistan.

A nine-member Afghan media delegation called on Army chief in his office at General Headquarter Rawalpindi on Friday. The army chief said Afghanistan and Pakistan were brotherly neighbours and a coordinated response against terrorists was needed instead of blame-game to counter their common enemy.

It is worthy of mentioning here that Things have gone from bad to worse between Pakistan and Afghanistan after President of United States Donald Trump announced his policy on Afghanistan. Trump has asserted that safe hideouts of terrorists exist on Pakistan side of Pakistan-Afghanistan border, a cherge which Pakistan has denied time and again. Unfortunately, Afghanistan has also backed Trump's claim that Pakistan was protecting terrorists by providing safe sancuries at his side of border. During his meeting with Afghanistan based journalists, army chief highlighted the sacrifices Pakistan rendered in war against terrorism and said, the terrorists were a common enemy of both Pakistan and Afghanistan and both need to join hand to get rid of them.

A press note issued from ISPR stated that the COAS reiterated that Pakistan has undertaken operations against terrorists of all hue and colour and there are no safe heavens inside Pakistan which are being used against Afghanistan.

The press note quoted General Qamar Javed Bajwa as that both Pakistan and Afghanistan need to take joint steps for effective border management along Pak-Afghan border. He said that Pakistan has already taken effective measures on its side, including fencing and establishment of new border forts and posts.

"" The delegation of Afghan media personnel thanked the COAS for his time and candid discussion. They acknowledged that such interactions were useful to understand each other and they are carrying back home a facts-based positively through this tour,"" the ISPR statement added.

Asif said that terrorists need not bases in Pakistan as they have stronghold in Afghanistan and can freely operate there.

""They (terrorists) do not need bases inside Pakistan if they control such a huge area in Afghanistan,"" he said.

Such statement might come from Trump to blame someone to cover up its failure in Afghanistan, he further added that they had already conveyed their viewpoint to power corridors in Washington.

While replying to a question, Asif said that they wanted to give a interim response to Trump's allegations and new Afghan policy, which would have input from the government, military and intelligence community, which is why it took a couple of days., adding that Pakistan had issued a comprehensive statement on the remarks of United States (US) President Donald Trump.

THE wheel comes full circle. After 9/11, it was Bush who was fuming with rage and revenge. His administration gave only one choice to Pakistan with loaded pistol on its head either you are with us or against. If you chose latter, will be bombed to Stone Age. Time was with US. Pakistan had to cave in and consequently suffered immeasurably in blood and goods. Now it is Trump who spoke callously with no less in content and command. At Jeddah Summit, Trumps listed Arabs countries, Afghanistan and India which have suffered grievously horror and terror. Name of Pakistan was conspicuously absent and intriguing. In case of Arabs, it is Iran which from Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen funds, arms and trains terrorists, militias and other extremist groups. He called upon vociferously to stand up to isolate Iran until it becomes partner in peace. In case of Afghanistan and India, it was just matter of time when he names the accused.

The omission of Pakistan from list of victim of terrorism was deliberate. Trump knew what he has to do next. It was his first formal address to nation as Commander- in- Chief when he lambasted Pakistan for providing safe havens to agents of chaos. He minced no word to charge Pakistan directly for harboring terrorists that US is fighting. Pakistan has to change and change immediately. Contrarily, it has to pay price. Pakistan has much to gain in partnering with US's effort in Afghanistan - a carrot and much to lose from harboring terrorists and criminals - a stick. Besides, he said adieu to his previous criticism of 16 years old Afghan while taking refuge behind desk in Oval office as things looked different from there.

US would stay in Afghanistan because consequence of a rapid exit are predictable and unacceptable, leaving a vacuum that terrorists would instantly fill however, security assistance to Afghanistan won't be a blank cheque. We are not building nation again. Trump called upon India particularly to help them more in Afghanistan especially in area of economic assistance and development nevertheless, he also left a window for eventual political settlement including Taliban but not before effective military effort is successful by their own specifications. US vice President, Mike Pence took no time to second what Trump said. President has put Pakistan on notice. Rules of engagement are being changed to enable US commanders on ground to make real time decisions to target safe havens in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

This all is much awaited Trump's policy to South Asia. One is baffled by its content, method and blithe. It is no recipe for peace. It is cordite for violence, instability and disaster. Situation in Afghanistan does not admit military solution. Few thousand US troops cannot achieve what over 140000 NATO troops could not achieve in 16 years. It will only prolong agony, harden the attitude and pose more serious hazards to peace however, it will provide alibi for US to stay in Afghanistan. It is not only US which has stakes in Afghanistan.

There are China, Russia and other regional countries too. They will not fold their hands and allow US to sit happily and call the shots. Afghanistan is a war torn country. It needs reconstruction, rehabilitation and development. The refusal of US to build nation will alienate Afghan people further and reinforce their impression of being under foreign occupation. It is needless to remind that Afghanistan has reputation of graveyard for foreign occupation forces, no matter how long it takes. Taliban's successes are clear pointers. One could only ignore this at own pearl. The dream of Trump to talk to Taliban at gun point may remain elusive.

The raising and maintaining a professional Army of around 350,000 strength need time and resources in abundance. Trump is money aversive and has asked Afghan Government to pay its share of defense bill. Afghan government has no money. This would keep Afghan Army under strength, ill-trained and poorly equipped thus, unable to restore writ of the Government. Resultantly chaos, anarchy and instability continue to stalk landmass of Afghanistan. Announced rash policy portrays US a posturing bully. One cannot win war by gestures only. It entails heavy price in blood and treasure. Trump is averse to both. Half measures gain nothing but pain.

Main charge against Pakistan is harbouring terrorists who kill US troops. Afghan Taliban are killing Americans. They are not terrorists but freedom fighters. To the contrary, Pakistan is fighting terrorists who are housed, financed and directed by Indian RAW and Afghan NDS on Afghan soil under tacit approval of US. Allotment of high profile role to India in Afghanistan is an abject insult to deep injuries, inflicted upon Pakistan in way of international cause of peace. Only insanity could fail to acknowledge great sacrifices of Pakistan.

US has done it. India does not deserve any role because it shares no border with Afghanistan. It has never worked worthwhile for cause of Afghanistan. It is only there to fuel fires of all kinds against Pakistan. Neither Pakistan could sit mute on this score nor could fight Taliban for sake of keeping US in good humour. In wake of new US policy, possibility of more drone strikes inside Pakistan would aggravate the situation further. Probably it is time to act differently, as time is not entirely with US. New winds are blowing in the region. All above would cause more instability in region. It suits to US to contain China and Russia. CPEC is real contention.

They don't react immediately and take days and weeks to respond to the happenings around. But Trump's Afghan Policy announcement was so serious a matter, the Chinese Foreign Minister considered it a matter as urgent as it came out with a prompt response. As President Trump's policy focus was mainly Pakistan - observers consider it a veiled declaration of war on Pakistan - China came to the rescue of Islamabad and exposed the lies told by Trump during his speech, which hailed India instead, without shedding blood of not more than a few individuals.

On the other hand Pakistan has sacrificed lives of over 75,000 people; hundreds of thousands are crippled and wounded, psychological effects are innumerable. China has rightly said no country has offered so much contribution other than Pakistan towards saving the rest of the world from the menace of terrorism. How can Pakistan sponsor terrorism, or offer terrorists' safe havens when it is itself worst victim of terrorism? Thank you China!

After a lengthy session of the National Security Committee under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Thursday, the top decision-making body in the realm of national security and defence, showed mirror to the United States by recounting successes of Pakistani forces in the war against terror and American failures in Afghanistan that have turned that country into a safe haven for terrorists and the resultant instability in Afghanistan posing great threat not just to Pakistan but the entire region.

The policy response of Pakistan contains elements that, if accepted and implemented by the other side, could help resolve the tricky Afghan conflict, providing face-saving to the United States to leave the country with some grace. Washington has been told in plain words that a politically negotiated outcome remains the best option to bring stability to this war torn country. A prolonged military campaign in Afghanistan has resulted in destruction and killing of hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians. Americans have made it a fashion to shift entire burden of their failures on Pakistan accusing the country of not taking action against some terrorist outfits especially dreaded Haqqani network prompting the NSC to point out that Pakistan would like to see effective and immediate US military efforts to eliminate sanctuaries harbouring terrorists and miscreants on the Afghan soil including those responsible for fomenting terror in Pakistan. They have been told that Afghan war cannot be fought in Pakistan and hopefully this message would go in the right perspective. The United States is misleading the world to believe that Pakistan is not cooperating despite receiving billions of dollars but the Committee exposed the claim by telling the US that the reimbursements to Pakistan since 2001 only account for part of the cost of ground facilities and air corridors used by the United States for its operations in Afghanistan, rather than any financial aid or assistance. As against this, a poor country like Pakistan has been made to suffer economic losses to the tune of $120 billion besides invaluable loss of human lives. Who will mitigate this loss? The NSC also raised the issue of India's greater role in Afghanistan, highlighting that India cannot be a net security provider in South Asia when it has strained relationship with all its neighbours and is openly pursuing a policy of destabilisation against Pakistan both from the east and the west. We would point out that all these things are known to the United States but their main objective is to squeeze Pakistan from all directions and therefore, it would be naÃ¯ve to expect that Washington would change its policy especially when it also plans to use India against rising China. Expression of concern and apprehensions about safety and security of Pakistani nukes by the US officials these days has nothing to do with the ground reality as there has been no such issue during the last over two decades. The United States has been openly appreciating the robust nature of the command and control system but the bogey of nukes falling into the hands of terrorists is raised off and on to put pressure on Pakistan and is also reflective of the longstanding desire of denuclearising the country. While appreciating the clear stance and a firm response to the US strategy by the NSC, we would point out that mere statements would not bring about any meaningful change in the ground situation. The Committee has declared intention to take the friendly countries into confidence and that could pay back as already both China and the Russian Federation have rejected this policy and declared US pressure on Pakistan as unjustified. However, we should also draw redlines in case Pakistan's sovereignty is violated in any manner or its national interests harmed at the altar of Indian friendship.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington (state)'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington (state)'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Scapegoat'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'National security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Command and control'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Sovereignty'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Russia'}}}]",,eng-3382459,-0.2392156862745098,241414920,1,pakobserver.net,news,Pakistan Observer,Washington (state) Terrorism Pakistan Afghanistan Scapegoat Shahid Khaqan Abbasi War on Terror Pakistan Armed Forces United States National Security Council National security United States Armed Forces United States India Command and control South Asia China Sovereignty Russia,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,26,42,3,2017-08-26

Salahuddin Haider

Under normal circumstances, Donald Trump's remarks should have been ignored, for he is still to familiarize himself with the complexities of statecraft, issues statements or order in the morning, to be withdrawn within or less than 24 hours. But his utterances against Pakistan does not and must not fall in that category. In his August 23 policy speech on Afghanistan and South Asia , he poured insults and humiliation against a sovereign country, forgetting that kingdom days have long been over. Such dictations or Royal commands, as these were called in olden days, have become history, detached and delinked with the working ways of yesteryears.

The threat from the US President to stop aid to Pakistan, hardly held ground, for Islamabad had enough of these already. Needless to go into detail about sanctions applied by United States, but just for record examples are being quoted here as tutorial for Trump. Despite being members of SEATO and Cento, Pakistan was treated as outcasts, examples of which can be traced back to signing of the Pak-China border agreement in 1962, the 1965 war against India, The Pressler Amendment, which Benazir as prime minister called ""veto in India's hands"", and the May 1998 sanctions when this country went nuclear as counter to similar tests from hostile Neighbour India.

The question that White House or the State Department in Washington must try to probe is whether these sanctions really mean anything in today's world. They might come out with different answers, for policy synchronization or consensus among multi-faceted US administration, has invariably been found lacking, each one of these seeing a particular issue with its own coloured glasses. But such dichotomy exists in perhaps almost every country, big or small. Pakistan is no exception either. ISI, Prime Minister's House, foreign office, interior minister, present different viewpoints in meetings on sensitive subjects. A harsh stand against Pakistan was nticipated since long before Trump made up his mind, but resort to threatening language was not only shocking but demanded instant rejoinder from the foreign office in Islamabad, which, as usual, was again found wanting.

Countrymen expecting a counter from prime minister of the foreign minister, appeared disappointed. They found relief in the person of army chief General Qamar Bajwa, who in a meeting with US ambassador David Hale, made it very clear that Pakistan required nothing, no aid, but simple goodwill and happier ties with America. The statement from army became instant, screaming headlines for television networks, engaged hectically for a counter from their government, which perhaps was in slumber, and newspapers next morning used as their main or in technical terms lead story, appreciating the army chief's bold initiative.

The second person deserving credit for befitting reply to Donald Trump was senate chairman Raza Rabbani, who as true democrat, and parliamentarian par excellence, looked angry at the threats held out to Pakistan. The language used by Trump, crossed all limits of decency, norms, and protocols reserved for such occasions.

However Shahid Khaqan Abbasi must be credited for his hurried visit to Saudi Arabia in company with foreign and finance ministers and must have mobilized some support from prince Mohammad bin Salman, now foreign minister of the Holy Land.

Without losing any more time, Abbasi summoned urgent meeting of National Security Council (NSC), a powerful body having important ministers, and three service chiefs as members, chief ministers, etc. which, though belated, nevertheless came as a substantial relief to the countrymen.

Its outcome was heartening. Foreign minister Khawaja Asif was asked to put off his visit to America, and instead seek guidance from China and Russia, the two powerful emerging players in international arena, whose spokesperson and president Putin had rebutted Trump for taking shelter behind blame game, instead of accepting his own government failure to help restore peace in Afghanistan. Both China and Russia have stood solidly behind Pakistan, for which the nation is grateful to them. Their support to Islamabad in moment of crisis, will long be remembered and written in golden words by historians.

Trump, who faces criticism almost daily for wearing too many masks at the same time, is bringing bad bad name to his country and great American people. CNN even on Friday August 26, did a crash programme to ask questions as to which statement of Donald Trump, should be accepted, and whether he really understood the meaning of governance.

Media generally has been hostile to the new US president, and some of his own trusted lieutenants have deserted him sooner than later after being appointed to responsible positions. Trumps' statement on Afghanistan was disowned not only by Pakistan, Russia and China, but also by President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul.

How could such a policy, as spelled out by Trump, could be called saner in value, tone or content? This is a major poser, answers to which American people and their senate and congress have to find. The senate has already outvoted Trump's attempt to outdo Barak Obama's heath care plan. That defeat should have been eye opened for him, but why does he persevere with his dubious policies, on domestic issues, and in international relationship, is something that has baffled analysts.

Pakistan after thorough, five-hour consultations of National Security Council, conveyed to him in unambiguous terms that it was Pakistan which had wasted 120 billion dollars in war on terror. American financial assistance was a peanut for land and air routes allowed to NATO and US allied forces during war against Taliban.

Instead of blaming Pakistan, Trump should order American troops still in Afghanistan to take control of 40 percent land of that country, still in possession of Taliban and ISIS forces who are not only fomenting trouble within Afghanistan, but are also a constant threat to Pakistan's security. Pakistan army has raised barriers on borders with Afghanistan to prevent Taliban and others from crossing over to Pakistan. The result has been heartening. Terorist attacks have subsided to a very great extent. Will Donald Trump now have a review of stance he has displayed so far, for there is method in madness also. He must display that now",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri':

The foreign minister, speaking on Geo News' program 'Naya Pakistan', said they informed Afghanistan that their territory was being used for attacks in Pakistan, the Afghan government said that up to 40 per cent of their territory was not under their control.

Asif asked why the terrorists would need bases in Pakistan when they can freely operate in Afghanistan.

""They (terrorists) do not need bases inside Pakistan if they have such a huge area to operate from in Afghanistan,"" he said.

Referring to US President Donald Trump's speech, the foreign minister said that he was not surprised by the speech outlining the new regional policy.

He said that they had an idea that such statement might come from Trump for the US had to blame someone, however, added that they had already conveyed their viewpoint to power corridors in Washington.

President Trump on Tuesday cleared the way for the deployment of thousands more US troops to Afghanistan, backtracking from his promise to rapidly end AmericaÂ´s longest war while pillorying ally Pakistan for offering safe haven to ""agents of chaos.""

""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,"" he said, warning that vital aid could be cut. ""That will have to change and that will change immediately.""

Asif said they wanted to give a coordinated response to Trump's statement, which would have input from the government, military and intelligence community, which is why it took a couple of days.

Asked about possibility of any US incursion into Pakistan, the minister said, ""I cannot comment if they are thinking so. But I ask what have they achieved in the past with such drone attacks and incursions.""

He said that they would make all efforts for a political solution. ""We are victims of terrorism, we have been on the forefront of this war.""

Asif went on to question as to who enabled the Taliban to operate freely inside Afghanistan and raise funds necessary to wage the insurgency.

""Vast tracts of land in Afghanistan were lost to the Taliban, while drug production grew there by more than 3000 percent following the US invasion.""

Commenting on his visit to the US, the foreign minister said: ""The dates for the visit are tentative, but we will present our point of view in front of them.""

Referring to Iran, he said the Iranian government is keen to see a peaceful Afghanistan.

Speaking about former Taliban supremo Mullah Akhtar Mansour's killing, Asif said Mansour entered into Pakistan from Iran and the purpose of his killing inside Pakistani territory was to convey a message that he was killed on Pakistani soil.

He also criticised the US for its unclear stance on Taliban. ""The US is demanding two things; one to kill the Taliban and at the same time to convince them for talks.

""We had influence over the Taliban in the past, but now they have found new shelters; there exist some other countries in our region as well.""

The foreign minister said the US has to face humiliation in the past, suggesting it to mend its ways.

""For us, Pakistan's peace is paramount,"" he said, noting that Pakistan even had its three-star generals martyred in this war against terrorism. ""We do not need US assistance; what we are looking for is trust.""

Asif further said that Pakistan's agreements with US should also be made public. ""Where the [US] drones fly from and where do they return everything should come to light.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_News', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Geo News'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Drone strikes in Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhtar_Mansour', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Akhtar Mansour'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Military intelligence'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Unmanned aerial vehicle'}}]",https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2017-08-25/155248_081726_updates.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.207843137254902,241415100,1,geo.tv,news,GEO TV,"Khawaja Muhammad Asif Donald Trump Foreign minister Terrorism Pakistan Afghanistan Islamabad Geo News Politics of Afghanistan Taliban Washington, D.C.

""Instead of engaging in a blame game, both Pakistan and Afghanistan should take action against terrorists based on mutual trust and cooperation,"" he said.

Apart from sending more troops into Afghanistan, the US seems determined to humiliate and pressurise action. Now, after the civilian and military leadership of the country conferred under the auspices of the National Security Council on Wednesday, Pakistan has given its response to the US. Most of the points made in the unusually long NSC letter are logical. In the first place, it has asked why Pakistan alone is being made the scapegoat for problems in the region and why Washington perceives that India on its own can offer security cover for the region. Pakistan's key demand to Trump's policy line, which criticised the country for harbouring terrorist havens and demanded they be demolished, is that terrorist camps based in eastern Afghanistan be dismantled just as quickly.

The issue of nuclear weapons security raised by the US, and the possibility that Pakistan's nukes may fall into terrorist hands, has also been firmly rejected as an absurdity as has the claim that Pakistan had taken millions of dollars from the US to fight terrorism but not utilised these funds for that purpose. The refusal to talk about Kashmir and the kind of atrocities taking place there was also taken up at the NSC meeting which has come up with a South Asian strategy of its own; a strategy that suggests closer cooperation between all countries in the region as equal partners rather than labelling one, without any evidence, as a sponsor of terrorism and suggesting that the war in Afghanistan could go on indefinitely. Senior analysts based around the world have already backed the line of a politically negotiated settlement in the country, an idea that Pakistan has continued to support.

While explaining our own position on Afghanistan and speaking out against Trump's incendiary policy was necessary, it is unclear what Pakistan can do beyond mere protest. The US is still the senior partner in this relationship as it holds the purse strings. As much as we deny needing US aid, successive governments have become reliant on handouts from Washington. The US, it seems, is determined to scapegoat Pakistan for its failure to win the war in Afghanistan. We can expect it to use aid as a weapon against us and perhaps even step up drone attacks. There is a long history of the US threatening Pakistan should it not take action against militant groups based on its soil, but by virtue of its unpredictability there is a genuine fear that this time the Trump administration may go further than Barack Obama and George W Bush ever did. Pakistan still needs to pursue its own policy of trying to bring the Afghan government to the negotiating table. It would not be surprising if the US finds that a few thousand additional troops in Afghanistan make little difference in its war against the Taliban. At that time, the US may then need Pakistan's help to set up peace talks. Till then, though, we need to try and deal with the US in a diplomatic manner while making it clear that it is unacceptable for it to pin all its problems in the region on Pakistan.","[{'uri': 'ocour_correspondents@thenews.com.pk', 'name': 'OCour Correspondents', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington (state)'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington (state)'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kashmir'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'South Asia'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nuclear weapon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Drone strikes in Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'George W.

The verdict is already out even before the new plan has been put to the test. American commentators, retired generals and even media outlets there are skeptical if the new US strategy for Afghanistan unveiled by President Donald Trump will succeed. But they all agree on one thing that it is Pakistan that is largely responsible for denying the US-led foreign forces a victory against the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Islamabad continues to be blamed for a 'double cross' ever since it joined the US-led campaign against the Taliban after 9/11 attacks in 2001. This despite the fact that Bush declared Pakistan a frontline state against terrorism while Obama went a step further by giving Pakistan a status of major non-Nato ally.

Such laurels aside, the two countries have failed to come on the same page despite 16 years of their long cooperation.

The reason is known to everyone. Washington strongly believes that Islamabad still provides support to the Afghan Taliban and its affiliated group the Haqqani network. Even a series of relentless counter-terrorism campaigns in the country, including North Waziristan Agency, once considered as headquarters of the Haqqanis, could not convince the US of Pakistan's sincerity.

But let's for a moment assume that the US allegations are true. Can Pakistan's support to Afghan Taliban deny the US and its allies a victory in Afghanistan? The reason Pakistan gets the blame for the mess in Afghanistan is due to its historical ties with the insurgent group. Our retired generals take the credit for defeating the former Soviet Union through Mujahideen in Afghanistan. However, we often missed a point that Pakistan could do nothing had the US and literally the entire world not backed those efforts. So effectively it was the former Soviet Union versus the rest of the world. The CIA had not only funnelled money but arms and other resources to help propel Mujahideen against the powerful Soviets. The result was inevitable: Soviet forces had to retreat. Ironically, today, the same countries, which once backed 'holy warriors' against the Soviets, are now battling them. It is now effectively a fight between the Taliban and rest of the world. If the Taliban are indeed Pakistan's proxy then you could say it is Pakistan versus rest of the world. Now just imagine that for 16 long years Pakistan has withstood the military might of US-led Western forces that at one time was around 150,000 in Afghanistan. Not only that Pakistan has outsmarted and outclassed the sophisticated and most modern militaries in the world which employed the best available resources to defeat the Taliban.

There is no denying the fact that some Afghan Taliban commanders and their families had been living in Pakistan and this was publicly acknowledged by former adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz. It is also true that like other countries including the United States, China, Russia and Iran, Pakistan maintains contacts with the Taliban and other groups. But to say that Pakistan's backing of Taliban is the main reason that victory remains elusive in Afghanistan is a compliment we don't deserve at all. We wish Pakistan had the capability and skill for such meticulous planning and execution. Had that been the case Pakistan would not have been in a dire situation where it is today.

Reality is that it is because of lack of wisdom, political acumen and leadership that we have so far not been able to find our right place in the comity of nations. So how come a country that is struggling to overcome a host of its own security, political and economic challenges can successfully keep the entire world at bay in Afghanistan through its proxies.

Pakistan's contacts with the Taliban may have bearing but it can never be a decisive factor in determining the final outcome of Afghanistan. Make no mistake. The real problem lies in Afghanistan where today the Taliban control or have influence over almost over 40 per cent of the country.

So why is Pakistan being singled out. The answer is simple -- the US needs a scapegoat. The more the US suffers in Afghanistan the more Pakistan is flogged.

Having said that we can't change how the US or its allies view Pakistan. But surely we can put our own house in order as lessons need to be learnt from our follies. We need to ask ourselves why the US does not issue ultimatums to countries such as Russia, Iran and even China which all now maintain contacts with the Taliban in one way or the other. The reason is simple: all these countries don't rely and thrive on foreign aid and hence are not answerable and accountable as we are today to the Americans.

On the face of it, there is nothing new in the so-called new Afghan policy of the US the salient features of which were announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday.

But a closer look at these features makes it clear that the US has finally decided to stay put in Afghanistan and fight to the last Taliban. And this time it is not asking Pakistan to 'do more' like in the past. This time the US is asking Pakistan to 'stop' forthwith 'aiding and abetting' the Haqqanis.

And interestingly, the US wants India to foot the bill of Washington's renewed Afghan war effort. Trump is not asking India to send its troops to the war-ravaged country. For this he is looking at Nato. If India agrees to foot Trump's war bill, it will lose Iran for good which would be a boon for Pakistan.

The most sensible response to Trump's latest on Afghanistan in Pakistan's context has come from Beijing. Asked about Trump's speech, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said: ""We are happy to see Pakistan and the United States carry out anti-terror cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, and work together for security and stability in the region and world.

""We hope the relevant US policies can help promote the security, stability and development of Afghanistan and the region,"" Hua said.

""We believe that the international community should fully recognise Pakistan's anti-terrorism (achievements),"" she told a daily news briefing. She certainly did not lambast Trump's speech as some analysts in Pakistan would have us believe that she did.

Our National Security Committee (NSC) which met under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Thursday strongly rejected US President Donald Trump's accusation that Pakistan has been undermining the US's so-called 'war against terror' despite receiving billions of dollars in aid. This was solely for the consumption of our domestic audience.

We know that the US would like to make a Cambodia of Pakistan at some future date when even after a surge in troops things would go from bad to worse. That is what we should be guarding against rather than wasting our breath on issuing useless and false bombastic against the US.

Our current Afghan policy has been built on the premise that one day soon the US boots would walk away from Afghanistan, leaving us to cope with the consequent mess like the CIA did after the first Afghan war. That is perhaps why we felt we needed to remain on the right side of the Taliban as we knew with the Isaf troops out of Afghanistan it would not take long for the Taliban to return to Kabul. Therefore, the safe havens for Haqqanis and the Quetta Shura, at the risk of being accused of playing a double game.

Now that the US has said that it is not going anywhere in a hurry we do need to revisit our 16-year-old Afghan policy. More so, because there are other equally compelling reasons for the US other than the Taliban to extend its stay in Afghanistan indefinitely.

With Afghanistan situated as it is in the heart of one of the world's most volatile regions, the US would find it almost impossible to walk away from. And for India to fight America's proxy war against China with any degree of effectiveness, the US would surely like to have its boots located in easy reach of the proxy war theatre.

With the US staying put in Afghanistan ostensibly until the full obliteration of the Taliban, we should stop bothering about being encircled by a hostile trio -- India, Iran and Afghanistan -- and start redesigning a new Afghan policy based on the premise that we do not need the Afghan Taliban any more. And at the same time we need a brand new policy to win the hearts and minds of the people of Afghanistan so that they would also feel that it was time for them to decide that they do not need the Pakistani Taliban any more.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Express_Tribune', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'The Express Tribune'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"", 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States National Security Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International community'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Counter-terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Beijing'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Beijing'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Iran'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta_Shura', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta Shura'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Shahid Khaqan Abbasi'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Proxy war'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'War on Terror'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Central Intelligence Agency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Cambodia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Cambodia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Kabul'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}]",https://c.tribune.com.pk/2017/08/1490992-MZiauddinnew-1503676921-680-640x480.JPG,eng-3382459,0.08235294117647052,241420200,1,tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,Donald Trump Pakistan India Afghanistan The Express Tribune Taliban Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China United States National Security Council NATO International community Counter-terrorism Beijing Iran Quetta Shura Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Proxy war War on Terror Central Intelligence Agency Cambodia Kabul Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan China,Pakistan,PK,,,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,26,10,5,2017-08-26

If that did not deliver victory, how will boosting it from 8,500 to 12,500 do it now?

In 2010, Barack Obama's vice president, Joe Biden, vowed that the United States would be ""totally out"" of Afghanistan ""come hell or high water, by 2014."" In 2014 Obama said that he would leave about 8,000 US troops there after all, and made an agreement with the new Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, that extended their stay ""until the end of 2024 and beyond.""

Donald Trump wasn't having any of that. Back in 2013 he tweeted ""Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA."" But it looks like the generals have now got to him with what passes for military wisdom.

On Monday Trump announced that he would be sending more US troops to Afghanistan - probably around 4,000 - and that they would stay as long as necessary. He has a clever new strategy, too: ""We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists."" (I bet George W. Bush and Obama wish they had thought of that.)

There is a strong temptation at this point to haul out the hoary old line: ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."" Trump is, indeed, proposing to do the same old things again, ostensibly in the hope of achieving different results.

Peak US troop strength in Afghanistan was 100,000 in 2010-2011. If that did not deliver victory then, how likely is it that boosting US troop numbers from 8,500 to 12,500 will do it now?

Neither the Soviet Union nor the British empire at the height of its power were able to overcome Afghan resistance to a foreign military presence, and we now have 16 years of evidence that the US cannot do it either.

Both the British and the Russians were able to maintain a military presence in the country as long as they were willing to take the casualties that involved, but in neither case did the regimes they install long survive their departure. Whatever their merits, those regimes were fatally tainted by their foreign sponsorship.

The US now finds itself in precisely the same situation. Ghani's government is certainly not the worst that Afghanistan has had to endure, but it lacks legitimacy in the eyes of Afghan nationalists because it depends on foreign troops and foreign money.

Since those foreign troops dwindled from 140,000 in 2011 (including non-American troops from a dozen other Western countries) to only 13,400 now, the Afghan government has lost control of about 40 percent of the country. And the process is accelerating: one-third of that territory was lost in just the past year.

Helmand province, which Western troops took from the Taliban between 2006 and 2010 at the cost of almost 600 deaths, is almost entirely back under Taliban control, and Uruzgan and Kandahar provinces are next. Even the capital, Kabul, for so long a bubble of safety, is now regularly targeted by suicide bombers: at least 150 killed in a massive blast in May, 20 more at a funeral in June, 35 more in a bus bombing in July.

So what would happen if the foreign troops all left and the Taliban became the government again, as they were from 1996 to 2001? Would the country become a breeding ground for terrorism? Would more plots like the 9/11 attacks be hatched there? Probably not.

The Taliban are essentially a nationalist group. Their extremely conservative take on Islam was not seen as a problem by Washington when they were fighting the Russians, and most rural Afghan males do not see it as a problem now. (Nobody asks the women.)

Most urban, educated Afghans are terrified of the Taliban's return, of course, but they are a small fraction of the population. And many foreigners see the Taliban as the least bad alternative to the US-backed regime. As Zamir Kabulov, the Russian special envoy to Afghanistan, said in early 2016: ""Taliban interests objectively coincide with ours.""

What he meant was that the Taliban aren't interested in foreign affairs at all. They do not dream of a world Islamic empire; they just want to run Afghanistan. Indeed, they are the main military rivals to the jihadis of Islamic State and al-Qaida who are currently trying to establish a foothold in the country - and by and large they are winning those little private wars.

But what about 9/11? There is good reason to suspect that Osama bin Laden and his mostly Arab companions of al-Qaida, then guests of the Taliban, did not warn their hosts before they carried out that atrocity, since it would clearly lead to a US invasion and the overthrow of the Taliban regime.

Obviously, few of these considerations will have occurred to Trump, but does that mean he really thinks he can win in Afghanistan? Not necessarily.

Maybe, like Obama, Trump has simply decided that he doesn't want the inevitable collapse of the Western-backed regime in Afghanistan to happen on his watch. He's just committing enough American troops to the country to kick it down the road a bit.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Barack Obama'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Joe Biden'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_afghani', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan afghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Russians'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nationalism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Soviet Union'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'British Empire'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Mujahideen'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'George W.

This fragmentation apart, the Kabul government's recent overtures for reconciliation and political mainstreaming of Taliban has also been hurt and fears have risen about escalations of hostilities on both sides leading to a fresh influx of Afghan refugees into Pakistan.

The new American policy has not only caused furor in Islamabad due to the threatening tone, but it has also created fissures in the sections of Afghan political groups whose efforts of reconciliation and mainstreaming Taliban into national polity have been hit hard.

The former Prime Minister Eng Gulbadin Hikmatyar's options have also shrunk as his commitment with the Kabul regime to bring Taliban sections to a dialogue table has also been reduced for which, he had done a lot of spade work.

It would be worth recalling that Hekmatyar has been staunchly demanding withdrawal of all the foreign troops from Afghanistan to give chance to peace through dialogue with the estranged Taliban. He had an assurance given by the Kabul regime at the time, he entered into a historic accord with it last year that no future reinforcements would be required and that a gradual withdrawal of foreign troops would take place soon.

Whereas Hamid Karzai a father figure in the Afghan society due to his two-term presidency has taken a rigid line by declaring not to tolerate any future air strikes on innocent citizens which cause huge collateral damage, he has also been emerged a nationalist pashtun leader in the country. For, in his opinion, it was time to reconcile with all the fighting forces in order to strengthen country's defence against the emerging danger of 'ISIS' which is causing havoc with the human lives especially creating sectarian divide in the country.

The Taliban which comprise on multi-sectarian forces are clearly perturbed over the alarming emergence of Daesh activities across the country.

They are, however, getting strong by the day as a large number of regular Afghan national army troops are joining them along with their arms due to lack of salaries and other privileges. The main source of Taliban has become tax on the transportation of opium, the largest cash crop produce of the country, smuggled out of the country.

The defence analysts and experts on Afghanistan also fear that the increase in Indian role in that country could further escalate skirmishes between Taliban and the foreign troops, including Indian installations.

The Taliban who were working on establishment of their political wing to enter into dialogue with the regime in Kabul may also halt its activities for three to four months and return to the strengthening of militant activities. They have already warned imminent escalation of war.

Another phenomenon that has crept into the Afghanistan's landscape is grabbing the ownership of one trillion-dollar worth of minerals as American companies as well as Indians are vying for the booty in lieu of their services and investment in that country.

The US policy change is also aimed at trying to get foothold in the Taliban captured and influenced areas which are full of these minerals, but the skeptics feel it may further escalate war in all the Taliban held parts of the country and result in pushing the citizens to the Pak Afghan border to sneak across and cause big

In an interview with Afghan media outlet TOLOnews on Saturday evening, Gen Nicholson said the issue of outside sanctuaries has to be addressed but that it was ""being addressed in private between the US government and the Pakistani government - but it does need to be addressed.""

""Support for terrorists and insurgents has to be reduced, has to be stopped,"" he stressed.

""I am primarily focused on activities inside Afghanistan,"" but other officials are looking into the issue of sanctuaries in Pakistan, he said.

According to him, the issue of sanctuaries was a serious one and one that needed to be addressed.

""The Quetta Shura, Peshawar Shura, these shuras are identified by cities inside Pakistan, we know Afghan Taliban leaders are in these areas,"" he said.

Specifically asked whether the Taliban leadership in Quetta and Peshawar and other major Pakistan cities ""shouldn't sleep in peace from now on"", he said: ""I won't put words in the (US) president's mouth but he definitely conveyed this message.""

He said that following US President Donald Trump's announcement earlier this week on his new war strategy, he, Nicholson, as a commander, has a new policy -- ""one based on conditions and not time.""

He said: ""It gives us additional capabilities. We have a direction now provided by the US policy that is being supported by NATO.""

On the issue of general security in Afghanistan, Nicholson said the ""civilian casualties is a real tragedy"".

On whether a diplomatic solution could be found, the general said this was a possibility but that a significant military effort inside the country would be carried out and that together the US would work with the Afghan government to increase its military capabilities.

""The Taliban cause the vast majority of civilian casualties and even though they have stated that it is their objective to reduce civilian casualties they have in fact increased civilian casualties. This is one of the points that we need to put on the table with the Taliban. They are not acting in the best interests of the Afghan people.""

""We know the Taliban receives the majority of its financing from narcotics traffic,"" he said, adding that the organisation has become a group that brings misery and hardship to the people.

Asked if he sees the Taliban as a terrorist organisation, Nicholson said: ""They do terrorist activities and they enable terrorists.""

As an example, he pointed to the Taliban links in the past to al-Qaeda.

On whether he had a mandate to go out and kill the Taliban, Nicholson said: ""It is our mandate to put military pressure on the Taliban.

However, he said that the US wants a peaceful solution in Afghanistan but that the ""Taliban need to know they cannot win militarily."" He said he hopes they enter the peace process.

""In the meantime, we will put increasing pressure on them inside the country and on the external sanctuaries.""

In terms of developing the military, he said the special forces will be doubled and with the growth of the Afghan air force, the Taliban will lose. He said these special forces' commandos have never lost a battle against the Taliban and with an expanded force they will retake the majority of territory either outside government's control or territory that is being contested.

He said as these forces expand their control, coupled with pressure on external sanctuaries, the Taliban will get to a point where it realizes it cannot win militarily and will have to enter into a reconciliation process.

In terms of security leadership and the high turnover of defence and interior ministers, Nicholson said the issue of leadership is an important one but gave credit to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani who changed leaders this summer. Nicholson said however that corruption was still a problem - particularly that relating to fuel contracts and personnel.

By spring of next year every soldier and every police officer will be biometrically registered, he said.

On the fuel contract issue, he said these contracts have been pulled back in under the US forces' control in order to cut down on corruption.

He said the attorney general's office was also making progress in terms of cracking down on corruption but that the US forces will keep an eye on this.

He said young leaders were meanwhile emerging -- leaders who were energetic and were being taken seriously.

Asked whether he was confident about winning the war, Nicholson said: ""I am very focused on my mission here and on delivering for the Afghan people and delivering for my nation and the alliance. I am very encouraged by the new policy by the United States ... yes I do feel confident.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOLOnews', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'TOLOnews'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta_Shura', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta Shura'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Air_Force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Air Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Narcotic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Commando'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Special forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Political corruption'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}]",https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2017-08-27/155481_110522_updates.jpg,eng-3382459,-0.07450980392156858,241511100,1,geo.tv,news,GEO TV,Taliban Terrorism Peshawar Quetta Pakistan Afghanistan TOLOnews NATO United States Armed Forces Quetta Shura Government of Pakistan Politics of Afghanistan Donald Trump Insurgency Federal government of the United States Demographics of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani Pakistan Air Force Narcotic Commando President of Afghanistan Special forces Political corruption Al-Qaeda,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,Center,ChatGPT,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,27,25,6,2017-08-27

Nicholson, the top United States commander in Afghanistan, claimed on Saturday that the US was aware of Afghan Taliban leadership's presence in Peshawar and Quetta, adding that the military would continue to put pressure on Taliban sanctuaries inside and outside Afghanistan.

In an exclusive interview with Tolo News, the top commander discussed US President Donald Trump's recent speech in which he revealed his long-awaited policy on the Afghan war.

Trump, in his first address as the commander-in-chief, called for greater troop deployment and Indian involvement in Afghanistan while lambasting Pakistan for offering safe havens to ""agents of chaos"".

According to Gen Nicolson, the matter of the alleged sanctuaries for terrorists was being addressed ""in private"" by the governments of US and Pakistan.

""The Quetta shura, Peshawar shura -- these shuras are identified by cities inside Pakistan; we know Afghan Taliban leaders are in these areas,"" said Gen Nicholson in the interview. ""Support for terrorists and insurgents has to be reduced -- [it] has to be stopped.""

The top commander said that Washington's new policy in the region was not time-based; rather, it relied on the fulfillment of certain conditions.

""It is our mandate to put military pressure on the Taliban,"" Gen Nicholson said, adding that Washington was seeking a peaceful solution in Afghanistan. ""Taliban need to know they cannot win militarily.""

Hoping that the Taliban would enter the peace process with Washington, the top commander said that the military would continue to put pressure on their sanctuaries inside and outside Afghanistan.

The top commander said that while it was possible to find a diplomatic formula in Afghanistan, the US would continue its military efforts in the country and help Afghan forces improve their capabilities.

By increasing their territorial control and continuing to put pressure on the 'safe havens', Gen Nicholson was hopeful that the Taliban would be forced to enter a peace process.

Following Trump's speech last Monday, relations between Islamabad and Washington have become tense.

A day after Trump accused Pakistan of duplicity, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had warned Pakistan that it could lose its status as a privileged military ally if it continues giving 'safe haven' to Afghan militant groups.

Tillerson had claimed that Washington has ""leverage"" over Pakistan, ""a non-Nato ally"" that has been receiving US aid.

US Ambassador David Hale held separate meetings with Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif and Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to brief them on the new policy.

""We are not looking for any material or financial assistance from the US, but trust, understanding and [an] acknowledgement of our contributions,"" the COAS had told Hale.

A day after the policy was unveiled, the Foreign Office had rejected the allegations made against Pakistan.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Commander-in-chief'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Washington, D.C.'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'India'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'India'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rex Tillerson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghan Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Secretary of State'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Islamabad'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qamar_Javed_Bajwa', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Qamar Javed Bajwa'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Khawaja Muhammad Asif'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}]",http://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/08/59a26d6cf2c55.jpg,eng-3382459,0.06666666666666665,241516560,1,dawn.com,news,Dawn,"Taliban Peshawar Quetta Pakistan Afghanistan Terrorism Commander-in-chief Donald Trump Insurgency Washington, D.C.

He said as these forces expand their control, coupled with pressure on external sanctuaries, the Taliban will get to a point where it realizes it cannot win militarily and will have to enter into a reconciliation process.

In terms of security leadership and the high turnover of defense and interior ministers, Nicholson said the issue of leadership is an important one but gave credit to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani who changed leaders this summer. Nicholson said however that corruption was still a problem - particularly that relating to fuel contracts and personnel.

By spring of next year every soldier and every police officer will be biometrically registered, he said. On the fuel contract issue he said these contracts have been pulled back in under the US forces' control in order to cut down on corruption. He said the attorney general's office was also making progress in terms of cracking down on corruption but that the US forces will keep an eye on this. He said young leaders were meanwhile emerging - leaders who were energetic and were being taken seriously.

Asked whether he was confident about winning the war, Nicholson said: ""I am very focused on my mission here and on delivering for the Afghan people and delivering for my nation and the alliance. I am very encouraged by the new policy by the United States ... yes I do feel confident.""

This interview comes just two days after Nicholson addressed a press conference in Kabul and said the Taliban has become a ""criminal organization that is more interested in profits from drugs, kidnapping and murder for hire."" He called on the group to lay down their arms and end the war. ""Taliban have a simple choice: Stop fighting against your countrymen. Stop killing innocent civilians. Stop bringing hardship and misery,"" he said.

He also said: ""We will not fail in Afghanistan. Our national security depends on that as well."" Nicholson made it clear that the US and NATO stand by the Afghan security forces against terrorists and enemies of Afghanistan and said that the Taliban cannot win on the battlefield. ""It's time for them to join the peace process.""

The US commander in Afghanistan again levelled baseless allegations that Afghan Taliban leadership has presence in Pakistan. He alleged that the so-called Quetta shura and Peshawar shura are identified by cities inside Pakistanand we know Afghan Taliban leaders are in these areas.

Pakistan has strongly rejected these allegations and maintained that Islamabadhas taken military action against militants of all hue and colors. Pakistan has successfully completed operation Khyber IV eliminating terrorists in Rajgal and Shawal valleys.

Earlier, the top security council of Pakistan, National Security Committee chaired by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has out rightly rejected the specific allegations and insinuation made by President Trump against Pakistan.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism',

President Donald Trump has ruled out withdrawal from Afghanistan. He initially resisted his advisers and was adamant on taking out US troops. Trump's Chief Political Strategist Steve Bannon was fostering a scheme devised by Erik Prince, the owner of the notorious security contractors firm Blackwater, to replace US troops in Afghanistan with 5,000 highly paid mercenaries. However, on August 18, Trump conceded to his national security team's plan for a surge of US troops to Afghanistan. Under a crisis-ridden system, the more things change, the more they remain the same. Bannon had to resign from his post. Vice-president Mike Pence told Congress that 3,900 extra soldiers would be sent to bolster the 8,400 there already.

Trump also warned Pakistan:""We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organisations... Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists... we have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting.""

Trump removed the garb of diplomatic hypocrisy most US presidents veiled in the past."" He didn't even spare the Afghan regime.""Our support is not a blank cheque... our patience is not unlimited. We will keep our eyes wide open.""

Just hours before TrumpÂ´s remarks, there was a stark reminder of the TalibanÂ´s reach when a missile hit KabulÂ´s heavily fortified diplomatic zone. A specially appointed congressional committee on Afghanistan has reported that the proportion of the country under government control had fallen during the 12 months from 72 percent to 57 percent, and 6,785 Afghan troops were killed with another 11,777 wounded. The Afghan National Security Forces have 370,000 troops and police. Between 2015 and 2016, 19 Americans were killed in action.

After the imperialist aggression in 2001, there has been a harrowing devastation of the already traumatised Afghanistan masses. The US puppet regime cannot expand its writ much beyond Kabul and the Taliban keep attacking but cannot return to power. Al-Qaeda still lurks in the shadows. The Islamic State is gaining ground in some regions. All kinds of power brokers jockey for their share of the lucrative opium trade that continues to reach record levels, in this stalemate. The imperialists have been looking for an exit strategy for at least a decade.

PJ Crowley, a former US Assistant Secretary of State, commented on Trump's speech and said, ""The Afghan war is not going to end any time soon, certainly not in his first term. He needs to tell the American people that US and NATO forces will still be in Afghanistan in 2021. Both Mullah Omar, the Taliban's leader at the time of the 11 September 2001 attacks, and Bin Laden died (the al-Qaeda leader killed by the US) on Pakistani soil. That is not a coincidence. There is no prospect of success in Afghanistan without dealing with Pakistan's duplicity.""

Donald Trump could only muster a hollow warning against Pakistan. In the past, withholding US aid has had little effect on the country's deep state. American administrations have been accusing Pakistan for years of 'running with the hare and hunting with the hounds'. US imperialism's criminal launching of CIA's largest covert operation in connivance with the Saudi and Pakistan's spy agencies to destroy the 1978 Saur revolution in Afghanistan comes back to haunt them. Their Frankenstein monsters created in the name of Islam are striking back with a vengeance.

Pakistan's spooks are not only aware of this intrinsic weakness of the US but are conscious of their relevance in this conflict's resolution, if any. They are not going to heed Trump's shallow warnings with their embrace of Chinese patronage. Nor will they give up their policy of 'strategic depth' particularly when everybody else is preying in the territory that is perceived by them as Pakistan's domain. The largest investor in Afghanistan with stakes in oil, gas, copper and other projects is China. Hence it is a principal participant in the conflict, but has avoided getting directly involved in Afghanistan's internecine war. However, China's swift rebuttal against Trump's remarks on Pakistan shows the former will try its best to fight any threat to its One Belt One Road project in the region with a massive investment of 900 billion dollars. But troubles of the western imperialists are intensifying. The Economist wrote, ""Perhaps most worryingly, Iran and Russia, always on the lookout for opportunities to undermine Western interests, are now working together to fund, arm and shelter the Taliban.""

Indian bourgeois has its hegemonic designs on Afghanistan. Saudi monarchy and other Gulf and Arab states nurture their proxies. One wonders how many great games the tormented people of Afghanistan can endure. All these stakeholders operate with their proxies comprising of the so-called non-state actors that are bestial terrorist mafias ravaging the region.

To achieve peace and prosperity, youth and toilers shall have to rise and take their destinies in their own hands. The victimised classes will indubitably rebel and enter the arena of mass revolt. Only through a revolutionary victory can peace and emancipation be guaranteed.",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald

Critics claim the policy only focuses on the continuation of the war instead of promoting political dialogue to end it.

President Ashraf Ghani welcomed President Trump's statement, which he said ""shows an enduring commitment by Afghanistan's foundational partner in this global conflict."" Chief Executive Dr Abdullah and some other government leaders, including first vice-president General Abdul Rashid Dostam, also hailed the US policy.

However, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai reacted angrily to the strategy and said the US president had insisted on continuation and expansion of war instead of peace, which, he said, was the fundamental and original demand of Afghans.

""We oppose and condemn America's approach and strongly oppose it,"" Karzai said in a statement posted online.

""Afghans call for permanent peace in the country and the region and not the expansion of the war, killings and destruction. The US should try to put an end to the war through dialogue and peaceful measures in Afghanistan and the region that will enable the regional countries to live in peace,"" said the former president, who still enjoys widespread support in Afghanistan.

Karzai, however, praised Trump's threatening posture towards Pakistan.

Hizb-e-Islami Afghanistan (Hekmatyar), which signed a peace deal last year and is now part of the political system, questioned Trump's decision for sending more troops to Afghanistan.

""Nearly 150,000 well-equipped American and NATO troops have been fighting against their armed opponents since October 2001. They have killed hundreds of thousands and displaced and maimed others. However, they have failed to bring peace to the country,"" Hizb's mouthpiece, Daily Shahadat, said in editorial comments.

""It is unclear as on what grounds and hopes Trump has made the decision to increase the number of troops. A total of 150,000 troops have been unable to bring peace so far. So what will just 4,000 additional troops achieve?"" the paper asked.

""The US and others who have troops in Afghanistan should think about pulling out their forces and instead spend the funds on the Afghan National Army and police. Afghans should be allowed to solve the problem,"" it said.

Latif Pedram, the leader of the National Congress Party of Afghanistan and a member of the parliament, also criticised the new US strategy and said that the Trump strategy ""continues the occupation and war in Afghanistan"".

Pedram, whose comments on the recognition of the border with Pakistan months ago caused uproar in Afghanistan, also accused India of creating trouble in the war-shattered country.

""The Indian government is also one of the factors contributing to the continuation of the war in Afghanistan,"" the lawmaker said on his official Twitter, while commenting on Trump's strategy.

""India opposes any policy that improves Afghanistan-Pakistan relations,"" Pedram further said, adding ""Trump and Narendra Modi will make Afghanistan the battlefield of the bloodiest war.""

Some independent analysts also opposed the US plan.

Dr Faiz Muhammad Zalanad, a writer and commentator, asked why President Ghani and Dr Abdullah were celebrating a vague policy.

Describing officials at the Presidential Palace as the ""Facebook militia"", he said the they were happy at Trump's policy because he had ""threatened Pakistan, but it does not mean that Trump will exert pressure on Pakistan for the sake of useless and corrupt National Unity government. For Trump, the US' own interests are the priority.""

""The new strategy will push the war towards intensification. It will be difficult to steer the country out of the situation,"" he said in comments posted online.

Pashtoon nationalist leaders in Afghanistan also seemed upset at the new US policy as they believe expansion of war will mostly affect the Pashtoons. Some of the Pashtoon leaders in TV debates expressed disappointment and pressed the Trump's administration to shift focus on peace process.

PRESIDENT Trump's broadside against Pakistan, related to the Afghanistan situation, and its sinister implications over-all cannot be taken lightly. It would appear that the sole superpower having burnt its fingers badly in its Afghanistan adventure - much the same as happened in Iraq - is out looking for a 'fall-guy'. President Trump's advent has resulted in moving of the goal-posts; given that the new administration is not known for adhering to the norms of diplomatic conduct. As for Pakistan, we find ourselves in a tight corner. A serious look over the shoulder at the (evolving?) mess in Afghanistan and its blow-back may not be out of place.

The trouble with news trickling out of Afghanistan is that it always gives out mixed signals. One thing is clear, though. Major stake-holders have for quite some time past grudgingly acknowledged what a closer study of history should have brought home to them before they enthusiastically embarked on their adventure: that no invading force has ever managed to subjugate the fierce and proud Afghan people. It is not territory that is of significance per se; it is the people that inhabit it who make the difference. Let us take a cursory look at the recent history of the happenings in the troubled milieu of that historic land.

History is witness that the US/NATO forces in Afghanistan have hardly fared any better than the earlier colonial expeditionary forces. The United States could perhaps be excused for having nursed the illusion that its awesome new and untested lethal weaponry would bring the ragged and comparatively lightly armed Afghan resistance to its knees. What it had failed to take into account was the indomitable will and raw courage of the Afghan people. The rest, as they say, is history.

In 2011, the departing commander of the British forces in Afghanistan had averred his belief that the Taliban ""will never be defeated"". Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith was quoted as having told The Times that, in his opinion, a military victory over the Taliban was ""neither feasible nor supportable"". He indicated that the only way forward was to find a political solution. The head of the French military force General Jean-Louis Georgelin - according to AFP reporting from Paris - had backed the senior British military officer's view that the war in Afghanistan was un-winnable. General Georgelin had asserted that all initiatives ""aimed at encouraging reconciliation among Afghans are good and should be encouraged"".

To top it all, US General David Petraeus had at that juncture confirmed that attempts were under way to open talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, General David McKiernan, the top US commander in Afghanistan, did not rule out reconciliation with ousted (now late) Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. At around the same time, a top United Nations official in Kabul had called for a political settlement. The top U.N. envoy, Kai Eide, was reported to have said that the war ""has to be won through political means"". He expressed the opinion that"" if you want to have relevant results you must speak to those who are relevant"". He added that, ""in my view a policy of engagement is the right policy"".

Admittedly, all of the aforesaid represented mere straws in the wind. Prudence demanded that they not be accepted at face value and not be allowed to become the basis of any hasty conclusions. The situation since has shown little signs of improvement. But the time to 'wait and see' is long past. As they say, forewarned is forearmed. Whichever way the events move, Pakistan, this time, simply cannot afford to be left high and dry. For far too long we have fallen into the abominable habit of missing the opportunities that fate lets fall in our collective lap. Missing the bus in the current scenario could well prove fatal. Should the Americans move swiftly and Pakistan does not do its sums right, there is imminent danger that the latter would be left holding the 'war on terror' baby, with all its terrible ramifications.

Americans can and will secure their vital interests in the region in any settlement, but for Pakistan the chickens let loose by the infamous U-turn may come back home to roost. The Taliban, who once led an Afghan regime that was not unfriendly towards Pakistan, may not be that accommodative this time around. The Northern Alliance leopard cannot be expected to change its spots. What is more, several variables have since entered the equation thanks to the vested interests of neighbors. The dÃ©tente between the United States and Iran sent out mixed signals.

The result of the presidential election in Afghanistan resulted in moving the goal posts to Pakistan's disadvantage. We have to be prepared to absorb the resulting shock-wave that thus materialised. The advent of the trump administration in the United States has further loaded the dice to Pakistan's detriment. The portents could hardly be more daunting! Here's hoping that the Foreign Office whiz kids are au fait with the turn of events and are busy in drawing up the viable options. To this may be added the hope and prayer that, when presented with these options, the powers that be will have the gumption and foresight to make the optimum choice. If not, the ship of the state may well be on its way to choppy and uncharted waters.

In an interview with Afghan media outlet TOLOnews, General Nicholson said the issue of outside sanctuaries has to be addressed but that it was ""being addressed in private between the US government and the Pakistani government -- but it does need to be addressed.""

""Support for terrorists and insurgents has to be reduced, has to be stopped,"" he stressed. ""I am primarily focused on activities inside Afghanistan,"" but other officials are looking into the issue of sanctuaries in Pakistan, he said.

According to him, the issue of sanctuaries was a serious one and one that needed to be addressed. ""The Quetta Shura, Peshawar Shura, these shuras are identified by cities inside Pakistan, we know Afghan Taliban leaders are in these areas,"" he said.

Specifically asked whether the Taliban leadership in Quetta and Peshawar and other major Pakistan cities ""shouldn't sleep in peace from now on"", he said: ""I won't put words in the president's mouth but he definitely conveyed this message.""

He said that following US President Donald Trump's announcement earlier this week on his new war strategy, he, Nicholson, as a commander, has a new policy -- ""one based on conditions and not time.""

He said: ""It gives us additional capabilities. We have a direction now provided by the US policy that is being supported by NATO.""

On the issue of general security in Afghanistan, Nicholson said the ""civilian casualties is a real tragedy"". On whether a diplomatic solution could be found, the general said this was a possibility but that a significant military effort inside the country would be carried out and that together the US would work with the Afghan government to increase its military capabilities.

""The Taliban cause the vast majority of civilian casualties and even though they have stated that it is their objective to reduce civilian casualties they have in fact increased civilian casualties. This is one of the points that we need to put on the table with the Taliban. They are not acting in the best interests of the Afghan people.""

""We know the Taliban receive the majority of its financing from narcotics traffic,"" he said, adding that the organisation has become a group that brings misery and hardship to the people. Asked if he sees the Taliban as a terrorist organisation, Nicholson said: ""They do terrorist activities and they enable terrorists."" As an example, he pointed to the Taliban links in the past to al-Qaeda. On whether he had a mandate to go out and kill the Taliban, Nicholson said: ""It is our mandate to put military pressure on the Taliban.

However, he said that the US wants a peaceful solution in Afghanistan but that the ""Taliban need to know they cannot win militarily."" He said he hopes they enter the peace process. ""In the meantime, we will put increasing pressure on them inside the country and on the external sanctuaries.""

In terms of developing the military, he said the Special Forces will be doubled and with the growth of the Afghan air force, the Taliban will lose. He said these Special Forces' commandos have never lost a battle against the Taliban and with an expanded force they will retake the majority of territory either outside government's control or territory that is being contested.

He said as these forces expand their control, coupled with pressure on external sanctuaries, the Taliban will get to a point where it realizes it cannot win militarily and will have to enter into a reconciliation process.

In terms of security leadership and the high turnover of defence and interior ministers, Nicholson said the issue of leadership is an important one but gave credit to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani who changed leaders this summer. Nicholson said however that corruption was still a problem - particularly that relating to fuel contracts and personnel.

By spring of next year every soldier and every police officer will be biometrically registered, he said. On the fuel contract issue, he said these contracts have been pulled back in under the US forces' control in order to cut down on corruption. He said the attorney general's office was also making progress in terms of cracking down on corruption but that the US forces will keep an eye on this.

He said young leaders were meanwhile emerging -- leaders who were energetic and were being taken seriously. Asked whether he was confident about winning the war, Nicholson said: ""I am very focused on my mission here and on delivering for the Afghan people and delivering for my nation and the alliance. I am very encouraged by the new policy by the United States ... yes I do feel confident."" -- Agencies",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Taliban'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Terrorism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Peshawar'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Afghanistan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOLOnews', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'TOLOnews'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'NATO'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Commander'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Armed Forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta_Shura', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Quetta Shura'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of Pakistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Politics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Insurgency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal government of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Demographics of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Ashraf Ghani'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Air_Force', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pakistan Air Force'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Narcotic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Commando'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'President of Afghanistan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Special forces'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Political corruption'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Al-Qaeda'}}]",,eng-3382459,-0.06666666666666665,241589220,1,pakobserver.net,news,Pakistan Observer,Taliban Terrorism Peshawar Quetta Pakistan Afghanistan TOLOnews NATO Commander United States Armed Forces Quetta Shura Government of Pakistan Politics of Afghanistan Donald Trump Insurgency Federal government of the United States Demographics of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani Pakistan Air Force Narcotic Commando President of Afghanistan Special forces Political corruption Al-Qaeda,Pakistan,PK,English,eng,,,C20,C5,Asia,AS,Muslim,136.0,149.0,120.0,118.0,123.0,96.0,102.0,124.0,129.0,119.0,124.0,140.0,166.0,55.0,14.0,50.0,70.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2017,8,28,7,4,2017-08-28
