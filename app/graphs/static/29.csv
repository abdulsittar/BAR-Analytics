We’re going to make America great again’, former US president told political conference in Washington

But polls show many Republican voters want alternative 2024 nominee like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, seen as better able to defeat President Joe Biden

Donald Trump vowed that the Republican Party would never return to what it was before he transformed it in his image, and he promised to “finish what we started” in another term, even if he is indicted and despite polls showing many Republican voters want an alternative.

Trump said in the keynote speech to close the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington that the party will never go back to being a party of “globalists” and “RINOs” (Republicans in Name Only) ruled by “freaks, neocons, globalists, open border zealots and fools”.

The former president is facing multiple investigations, including for his handling of classified documents and his role in the January 2021 insurrection, but he told reporters before the speech “absolutely I wouldn’t even think about leaving” the race if he is indicted.

“We are going to finish what we started,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd in a ballroom that was about two-thirds full. “We’re going to complete the mission, we’re going see this battle through to ultimate victory. We’re going to make America great again.”

Trump made his biggest public appearance since announcing his third White House bid in November, serving as the main attraction at CPAC after many of his potential 2024 rivals including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former Vice-President Mike Pence skipped it.

The only other declared or potential candidates who spoke at the four-day event were former Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, anti-ESG crusader Vivek Ramaswamy, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Michigan businessman Perry Johnson.

Trump has dominated recent CPAC events and its presidential preference straw polls, with many attendees wearing his red “Make America Great Again” hats and vendors hawking a variety of Trump-themed T-shirts, flags and other gear.

Political observers and Trump’s potential rivals were watching to see whether his reception at a diminished CPAC had slipped at all with polls showing a majority of Republican voters looking for an alternative nominee like DeSantis who supports Trump’s policies without his political baggage and is better positioned to defeat President Joe Biden.

But Trump once again dominated the CPAC straw poll. He was the choice of 62 per cent of the 2,028 CPAC attendees who took part, compared with 20 per cent for DeSantis, 5 per cent for Johnson, 3 per cent for Haley and everyone else at 1 per cent or less. That was higher than the 59 per cent support Trump drew in a CPAC straw poll held in Orlando, Florida a year ago.

The former president did not draw direct contrasts with DeSantis and other rivals in his speech, instead emphasising the achievements of his first term and promising to fight for his aggrieved supporters if voters put him back in the White House.

“In 2016, I declared: I am your voice,” Trump said. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution.”

DeSantis, Pence and others considering a White House bid who skipped CPAC attended a Club For Growth donor retreat in Florida where Trump was not invited. The conservative group has signalled it is moving on from Trump.

In a speech at CPAC on Friday, Donald Trump Jnr, the former president’s son, referenced that retreat when he announced that some CPAC attendees could attend a reception with his father before his speech while his rivals were soliciting “billionaire Chinese sympathists”.

“That’s our message, that we need a president that is not owned by other people, right?” he said.

In his CPAC speech, Trump recited the “witch hunt” investigations he faces and his familiar grievances and false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. He said the first reconciliation bill he will sign if elected will be “a massive increase” in the border patrol and number of immigration agents.

Trump also touched on many of the policy proposals he has outlined in campaign videos in recent weeks, including plans to “protect children from left-wing insanity”, to “stop the America last warmongers and globalists” and “a new trade plan to protect American workers” that calls for ending imports of essential goods from China over four years and stopping US companies from investing there.

He also highlighted a plan released on Friday touting “a quantum leap in the American standard of living” that calls for using federal land to build up to 10 new “freedom cities” and to ensure that the US leads in the development of flying vehicles.

Haley got a warm welcome from the CPAC crowd but mostly polite applause throughout her speech, and she was heckled by chants of “we love Trump” after exiting. She made no direct contrasts with Trump, focusing instead on President Joe Biden, “socialist Democrats” and the threat from China.

Pompeo also avoided mentioning Trump besides criticising the US$8 trillion added to US debt during the Trump administration. He took some veiled jabs at the former president, including saying, “We can’t become the left, following celebrity leaders with their own brand of identity politics, those with fragile egos who refuse to acknowledge reality.”",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Political_Action_Conference', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Conservative Political Action

Probably, it'll enhance my numbers, but it's a very bad thing for America. It's very bad for the country.""

Trump made the remakrs while being asked at a gaggle before his conservative political action conference address, media reports said.

Trump is up against a barrage of investigations or legal challenges, including a civil lawsuit over alleged business fraud from the New York Attorney General Letitia James; a sprawling criminal inquiry from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office; an investigation from Fulton County; and special counsel Jack Smith's two-pronged Justice Department investigation into the Georgia poll interferences by him and his supporters in 2020.

Trump drew an enthusiastic crowd at the CPAC where he decried the litany of investigations against him, contending ""they've weaponised justice in our country"", the Washington Examiner reported.

He declined to commit to Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel's call for 2024 candidates to make a pledge to back the eventual nominee. This was evidence he saw no one but himself being in the race for 2024.

""There are probably people that I wouldn't be very happy about endorsing that are running, so we'll see. I think some of them, I won't use names, I don't want to insult anybody, but some of them, I would not be very happy about,"" Trump told reporters.

McDaniel had sought to corner all Republican 2024 contestants to back the eventual nominee in exchange for access to the debating platform.

However, not just Trump, candidates or potential 2024 hopefuls, such as former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, have been noncommittal, reports said.

Trump presented himself as ""retribution"" for his loyal followers. He had won the CPAC straw poll at the confab, which appeared to have lower attendance levels than in the past.

""In 2016, I declared: I am your voice,"" Trump said. ""Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution.""",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Attorney General of New York'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Letitia James'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Conservatism in the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Lawsuit'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Political_Action_Conference', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Conservative Political Action Conference'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'New York County District Attorney'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Republican National Committee'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Washington Examiner'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Department of Justice'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Georgia (U.S. state)'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Georgia (U.S. state)'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Fulton County, Georgia'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Fulton County, Georgia'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_poll', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Straw poll'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asa_Hutchinson', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Asa Hutchinson'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Governor of New York'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Republican Party (United States)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Arkansas'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Arkansas'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}]",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/1a1c6cfd370b69857e45d7bec7389f83_w_800_h_450.jpg,eng-8452217,-0.1294117647058823,415864740,1,in.investing.com,news,Investing.com India,"Donald Trump Attorney General of New York Letitia James Conservatism in the United States Lawsuit Conservative Political Action Conference New York County District Attorney Republican National Committee Washington Examiner United States Department of Justice Georgia (U.S. state) Fulton County, Georgia Straw poll Asa Hutchinson Governor of New York Republican Party (United States) Arkansas",China,CN,,,,,C18,C9,Asia,AS,Irreligion,54.0,average,average,average,best,average,best,best,best,best,best,average,worst,high,low,high,low,high,low,,,,,,,,,-1,,,0,False,2023,3,7,59,5,2023-03-07

DeSantis: Latest Poll Shows Biggest Lead So Far Among GOP Voters, With One Candidate Ahead By 25% By Benzinga","Benzinga - Former President Donald Trump continues to dominate Florida Gov. Ron DeStantis by a hefty margin among Republican primary voters, despite the latter traveling across the country to promote his newly released memoir.

On Tuesday, a Morning Consult survey that was conducted between Feb. 26 and Feb. 28 showed 53% of Republican voters favor Trump as the party's presidential candidate for the 2024 election, compared to 28% who want DeSantis, according to Newsmax.

Last month, Trump lashed out on Truth Social, accusing Fox News of favoring DeSantis by ""barely showing"" a Feb. 26 poll that had Trump beating DeSantis by 15 points in a hypothetical GOP primary. The new poll shows Trump gaining support, now leading by 26 points.

What's More: The latest poll not only shows Trump edging higher in a hypothetical primary election but, for the first time, coming out ahead of President Joe Biden in a general election, leading the Democrat by one point, according to the report.

DeSantis, who hasn't yet officially announced his candidacy but is expected to as early as this spring, came in four points behind Biden in the same poll.

Former Vice President Mike Pence trails with just 7% of the vote, while Nikki Haley, who announced her candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination in February, garnered 4% support. Former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney received 2% support.

As for who could come out on top in the Democratic primaries, Biden leads Marianne Williamson by a landslide with a 73-point advantage. Williamson announced her second bid for the presidency on Saturday, according to NBC.
