3236,7477651026,eng,2023-04-02 11:24:00+00:00,0.0,https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2023-03-30/ty-article-magazine/netanyahus-next-power-grab-is-coming-heres-how-to-prepare/00000187-33ad-da89-a39f-3fbdab8f0000,Netanyahu's next power grab is coming. Here's how to prepare,"From the very establishment of Israel, our democracy has lacked strong mechanisms of self-defense. We have no constitution, no upper house of parliament, no division of powers between the central government and the local government, and no limit on the prime minister's term in office. There is no robust system of checks and balances to limit the power of the government. The only brake on its power comes from the Supreme Court.

Israeli democracy has nevertheless survived for 75 years, for one simple reason: A large majority of Israeli citizens and Israeli leaders wanted democracy. No significant force seriously challenged the democratic system in an attempt to gain unlimited power for itself. There have been governments in Israel that enjoyed a huge majority in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, with its 120 members. Levi Eshkol's government (1963-1969), for example, started off with the support of 75 MKs and later increased its majority to a staggering 111 MKs. The government of his successor, Golda Meir, started with 102 MKs, which later dropped to a still-formidable 76 MKs. But the weak defenses of Israeli democracy held, because all these governments respected the limits of their power.

In recent weeks, the picture has completely changed. Today we know that there is a significant group in Israel that wants to dismantle our democracy and grab unlimited power for itself. Though its majority in the Knesset consists of only 64 MKs, this is what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition is attempting. Thanks, however, to the unprecedented resistance that has emerged from all avenues of Israeli society, it seems that Netanyahu's coup is failing, at least in this current round. But the writing is already on the wall. Those who failed in the coup attempt of winter 2023 have already said they will try again in summer, and if they fail once more, they may well keep trying in later years, with even greater force.

Therefore, we must not be satisfied with merely freezing the antidemocratic bills the Netanyahu coalition has been attempting to pass. And under no circumstances can we agree to half a coup, or even a quarter-coup. We must not allow any further weakening of the already weak defenses of Israel's democracy. On the contrary: Israeli democracy must emerge from this crisis with a much stronger immune system - one that will be able to withstand future coup attempts, even if they are instigated by coalitions of 76 or even 111 MKs.

To accomplish this objective, we need to pass through two main stages.

Stage 1: Stopping the coup

We are currently at the first stage, which has one clear goal: We must stop the coup. A temporary freeze on the antidemocratic bills is not enough. It is important to discuss potential compromises, but it's no less important to prepare for the worst-case scenario. Netanyahu and many members of his coalition have stated clearly that the legislation that would give them unlimited power has not been shelved: It has only been temporarily suspended. In the current state of affairs, the proposed coup package remains like a loaded gun in the hands of the government, which can pull the trigger at any moment. In particular, the government has already completed preliminary work on the law that would give it control over the appointment of Supreme Court judges: It could arrange for this bill to gain final approval in the Knesset with only a few hours' notice.

If the government resumes its attempt to pass laws that would in effect give it unlimited power, the Supreme Court must use its authority to strike these laws down, one by one. First and foremost, the Supreme Court must strike down any legislation that gives the government control of the Supreme Court itself. The Court must do this not in order to protect itself, but to protect the liberties of all Israelis.

If the Supreme Court strikes down such undemocratic laws, and the government refuses to accept its rulings, then the police, army and other branches of the security forces, as well as all public-service employees, must protect democracy and support the Court. They should not obey the illegal orders of a government that is trying to establish a dictatorship.

In such a scenario, every citizen has an important role to play. Demonstrations, protests and strikes would provide popular support for the justices of the Supreme Court, the security forces and civil servants. All of them are human beings, and no sane person wants to bear alone the enormous burden of responsibility. No sane person wants to make by themselves the decisions that will shape Israel for generations. Therefore, every time someone has to make a fateful decision about the future of Israeli democracy, it is essential that hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets and declare: ""We are with you, and we expect you to defend democracy. The responsibility lies with all of us, not just with you.""

Among the hundreds of thousands of people who have already come forward in defense of democracy, the reserve soldiers stand out. These dedicated citizens, who for years have said ""Yes!"" every time Israeli democracy called on them to perform difficult and life-threatening tasks, are now the first to have said ""No!"" to the dictatorial demand for blind obedience. Going to war requires great courage of one kind. Standing up to a dictatorship requires great courage of a different kind. Today we know that Israeli society is blessed with men and women who possess both types of courage.

Reservists have several good reasons to say ""No!"" to a tyrannical government that is attempting to obtain unlimited power for itself while demanding at the same time that everyone else continue to serve as usual. For one, the coup creates new legal dangers for all members of the security forces - both reservists and members of the standing army. As long as they serve a democratic country with an independent judiciary, this significantly reduces their chances of being arrested by a foreign legal authority while traveling overseas, and prosecuted on suspicion of having committed war crimes. But if the government eliminates the independence of our domestic judiciary, such risks will increase dramatically. Israel's security personnel endanger their health and their very lives for the sake of the state - at the very least, they can expect the state to provide them with adequate legal protection.

Another reason to resist the coup is that it endangers members of the security forces from a moral perspective. When soldiers are ordered to attack a target, to bomb a building, or to kill a person, they do not usually have the time and ability to check whether the order meets a reasonable moral standard. How can a fighter pilot or a gunner make sure the target they were ordered to attack is a legitimate military target? How can they be sure that the order doesn't stem from a racist worldview of a superior who wants to ""wipe out"" entire towns and villages (a desire recently expressed by Israel's finance minister)? In a democratic country with an independent judiciary, soldiers can at least hope that their orders have been vetted by responsible moral authorities. But in a dictatorship without an independent justice system, soldiers may find themselves committing terrible crimes that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.

The third reason for reservists to say ""No!"" to a dictatorial regime is the simplest. Members of the security forces have a contract with Israeli democracy. They have no obligation toward a government that is set on destroying democracy.

Some say that all of this may be true, but the brave stance taken recently by more and more reservists endangers the very existence of Israel at this time. But in reality, it's the government that has placed Israel in existential danger, not the reservists. The Netanyahu government has taken the State of Israel hostage, and then blames everyone but itself for the consequences. If the government believes we are facing a dangerous security situation, it is its responsibility to halt the coup attempt by scrapping the legislation it started pushing through.

Stage 2: Establishing a new contract

Once the coup attempt is stopped, the second stage should be the establishment of a new social contract for the State of Israel - one that will ensure stronger protections for our democracy. There are many ways to do this, but the key question that should guide us is simple: ""What limits the power of the government?""

The public should not be distracted by detailed, technical discussions about the composition of the Judicial Appointments Committee, or the wording of this or that legal clause. In every newspaper, in every television studio, on every radio program, and in every cafeteria conversation, we should insist on asking again and again: What mechanism will prevent the ruling coalition from disenfranchising Arab citizens, depriving workers of their right to strike, or closing down all independent media outlets? What is the mechanism that will prevent the ruling coalition from criminalizing same-sex love, forcing women to cover their hair in public, or banning schools from teaching about evolution?

Today, the State of Israel has only one institution that protects our rights and liberties from racist or oppressive legislation. That institution is the Supreme Court. The government is currently trying to dismantle the independent power of this body - something we cannot give in on, even partway. There can be no compromise on this matter. The government must not be given control over the appointment of judges, and the power of the Supreme Court must not be reduced. The battle is not over the Supreme Court per se. The battle is about the only mechanism that protects people against the arbitrary power of the government.

However, once we enter the process of drafting a new social contract for the State of Israel, there is of course no necessity in continuing to sanctify the mechanism of the Supreme Court in its present form. What is crucially important to the opponents of the coup is not the Supreme Court, but the liberties it protects. We can certainly consider alternative mechanisms to limit the government's power and protect our liberties.

Other democracies have a wide variety of mechanisms that protect human rights and civil rights, and prevent the over-concentration of power. The United States is a prominent example of a country that has a robust system of checks and balances. For example, what happens if a majority of members of the U.S. House of Representatives votes to deny African Americans the right to vote, or to ban Jews from ritually circumcising their sons? Even if such a bill were to be passed by a majority of House members, it would still face a whole series of additional hurdles.

First, the bill would also have to be approved by the Senate, whose members are elected separately from those of the House. At present, the House of Representatives is controlled by the Republican Party, while the Senate is controlled by the Democrats. And those familiar with the intricacies of the American system will realize that such a bill would likely have to overcome the filibuster. For that, 60 percent of Senate members would need to support it.

Let's say the bill has passed the Senate, too. The obstacle course does not end there. The president, who is elected independently of both House and Senate members and by yet a third method, can still veto the bill. Another major obstacle is the American Constitution. A temporary majority in the House of Representatives cannot change the Constitution, and a law that denies African Americans the right to vote or prohibits ritual circumcision is unequivocally unconstitutional.

And of course the United States also has a Supreme Court. To justify its power grab, the Netanyahu government has repeatedly told Israelis that in the United States, ""it is politicians who appoint the Supreme Court justices."" This is true, but misleading. First, a Supreme Court appointment must have the support of both the president and the Senate, which, as noted, are elected separately. Second, the Court is not the sole brake on the power of the U.S. government. If in Israel we were to give politicians the power to appoint judges, but at the same time we also adopted a constitution, established a senate-like upper house, and gave the president veto power over new laws - that's a scenario opponents of Netanyahu's coup would likely be very happy to discuss. But this is not what the government is suggesting.

Let's return to the United States. Let's say that some extremist law somehow managed to pass the entire obstacle course of both houses of Congress, the president, the Constitution and the Supreme Court. That's not the end of the story. The United States is a federation. It consists of 50 states, each with its own bicameral legislature, a governor, constitution and supreme court. There are significant restrictions on the ability of the federal government to interfere in the internal affairs of the 50 states. In Israel, if the same people who want politicians to appoint judges also proposed turning the country into a federation of autonomous districts - this could well be something that opponents of the coup would be happy to explore.

Some may feel that the United States has too many systemic brakes, and that this makes it overly difficult to introduce positive changes. That may well be the case. In Israel, we don't have to adopt the entire battery of checks and balances that the United States possesses. But it would be good if we had at least two or three safeguards. As of today, we have but one. For historical reasons, Israel never adopted a constitution, we have no senate, no filibuster, the president has no veto power, and there is no federal system. The only mechanism limiting the power of the ruling coalition, as created by our founding fathers and mothers, is the Supreme Court.

This unique situation, in which the Supreme Court is the only body with the authority to limit the ruling coalition, explains one of the common questions heard these days in Israel: ""Why does the Supreme Court interfere in everything?"" If the Knesset passes a law that discriminates against women, or if a government official harasses a citizen, or if a government office decides to build a dump on the nature reserve next door, we immediately run to the Supreme Court. We do so because we simply have nowhere else to turn, which is definitely not an ideal situation. It would have been better to establish additional limits on the power of the government. Imagine a car that has only a single brake, and someone wants to disable that brake on the grounds that it has too much power. Wouldn't it be far safer to first install a few additional brakes, and then gradually release some of the pressure on the dominant one? Neutralizing the lone brake without first creating alternative safety mechanisms is a sure way to crash and burn.

Aren't elections a kind of additional brake?

According to a common argument, the above description ignores the existence of another important limit on the government: our national elections. If the government passes laws or takes actions that the public doesn't like, the public can replace the government at the ballot box at the end of its four-year term. Since we have regular elections, why do we need more brakes?

It's hard to know whether those who make this argument really believe it, or if they are being disingenuous. But, clearly, in a system where nothing limits the government's power, then there's nothing to stop it from changing the electoral system at will, to ensure that the public can never replace it. There are many examples of countries with such systems, including Russia and Iran, both states where elections are held regularly but are a dictatorial ritual, rather than a truly democratic mechanism.

In recent weeks, we've learned that the ruling coalition in Israel is seeking to postpone the next scheduled elections from 2026 to 2027, by creatively interpreting an obscure passage in existing electoral law. MK Eliyahu Revivo (Likud) has submitted an additional bill that would allow, under certain conditions, for the ""gifting"" of 12 additional MKs to the ruling coalition. If that bill becomes law, then in certain situations, the public would elect 120 MKs, and the coalition that emerges would then receive a heavenly gift of 12 more MKs. In the absence of any limits on its power, the ruling coalition could also prohibit opposition parties from participating in elections, deny voting rights to entire communities, or require anyone showing up to vote to first sign some sort of ""declaration of national loyalty,"" to be drafted, naturally, by the coalition.

In fact, with no limits on the government's power, it doesn't need to pass any laws to rig the outcome of an election. Ministerial regulations and decrees would suffice. For example, the minister of national security could announce that, unfortunately, as he is not able to provide adequate security at polling stations in Arab communities, residents of Arab towns and villages who wish to vote must travel to Jewish towns to do so. Israelis are very creative people, and if there are no restrictions facing them, coalition members could invent a thousand and one tricks for tilting election results in their favor. The bottom line is that if there is no limitation on the power of the government - then there will be no such thing as a democratic election.

What about the power of the Supreme Court?

Another common argument is that while giving unlimited power to the government sounds like a very bad idea, allowing the Supreme Court to enjoy unlimited power is equally bad. According to this argument, the laws that the government is trying to pass are simply designed to curtail the unlimited power that the Supreme Court allegedly enjoyed in the last decades.

This argument is so far-fetched that one can only wonder if those making it actually believe it. What can they mean when they declare that the Supreme Court possesses unlimited power, when the opposite is the case?

Let's ask a few trivia questions about Israeli history and politics. Which of Israel's many wars were launched by order of the Supreme Court? What military operation in Israeli history was directed by justices of the Supreme Court? Which peace agreement was signed by the Supreme Court? When was the last time the Supreme Court prepared and passed the state budget? Which city in Israel was built by the Supreme Court? What is the Court's plan for solving the country's housing crisis? Or dealing with climate change?

We can go on asking more such questions, but you get the point. The Supreme Court does not have unlimited power. Unlike the government, the Supreme Court cannot declare war or make peace; it doesn't control the budget and doesn't build cities; and it cannot solve the housing crisis or the ecological crisis.

It's the government that controls the state's formidable executive apparatus. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, police and civil servants are recruited and financed by the government, and obey its orders. This executive apparatus gives the government immense power: to declare war and make peace; pass budgets and build cities; and (if it wants to) solve the housing and climate crises. The Supreme Court does not control any such executive apparatus. It is no accident that throughout history there have been many examples of dictatorships established by governments, but few if any examples of a dictatorship established by a court. The court simply doesn't have the power to do it. Those who insist that the court commands unlimited power probably don't understand the meaning of the words ""power"" and ""unlimited.""

In exceptional cases, Israel's Supreme Court does have the power to compel the government to act, if the government has neglected its legal obligations to its citizens. In 2007, for example, the Court forced the state to fortify inadequately protected schools in communities close to the border with the Gaza Strip. And even in this case it was the government itself that initiated the action, and the judges only made sure that the government implemented its own decision. In the vast majority of cases, the power of the Supreme Court is only preventive. When someone in the sprawling governmental apparatus - from the prime minister down to a local official - does something that we think is unfair, we can run to the Supreme Court and ask it to hit the brake.

You may wonder whether this doesn't give the court too much power. Even if the Supreme Court cannot initiate much, isn't it excessive to allow it to stop any action or decision of any government official? Doesn't that give the Court the ability to completely paralyze the country? Well, not really. Recently, Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir bragged that every day he makes 90 executive decisions. Maybe that's true. But let's assume for a moment that he was exaggerating, and that he only makes nine decisions a day. Just like Ben-Gvir, the foreign minister, the Interior Ministry's director general, the head of the Treasury's budget division, and hundreds of thousands of other public servants make nine decisions every day. That would amount to over a million decisions a day. In theory, it's possible to submit a million petitions to the Supreme Court every single day, asking it to stop each one of these million decisions. But does anyone think this is really practical? And can 15 Supreme Court justices conduct a million hearings every day? The truth is that the Supreme Court only rarely uses its ability to invalidate laws or stop government decisions. In its entire history, the Court has only invalidated 22 laws or components of laws.

It's true that relative to other supreme courts around the world, Israel has a court with great power. But that's because the state never created another mechanism to limit the government's actions. The kind of matters that are brought before the Israeli Supreme Court never reach the U.S. Supreme Court, because they end up on someone else's desk - perhaps in the U.S. Senate, or in the office of the governor of California, or the Texas House of Representatives. It would be ideal for Israel to have more brakes built into its system, but before we neutralize the Supreme Court, let's first install those other brakes.

Is the Supreme Court the protector of the elites?

Another story circulating in Israel these days says that the Supreme Court is a mechanism that preserves the power of ""the elites,"" and hampers any attempt to achieve social justice. There is no doubt that Israel suffers from high levels of social inequality, and that we need to tackle this problem as quickly as possible. But is it really the Supreme Court that is thwarting change?

Have you heard of cases in which the Knesset passed laws in order to reduce social inequalities, but was thwarted when the Supreme Court intervened and invalidated them? Of the 22 laws struck down by the Supreme Court, the only one that could perhaps be described as a law intended to reduce social inequality was the bill that imposed a special tax on ownership of a third apartment, and the reason for its disqualification, in 2017, was improper legislative procedure.

If the Netanyahu government had a deep and genuine concern about social justice, it could have started its term of office by passing a comprehensive package of laws to reduce inequality. If the Supreme Court had intervened and invalidated these laws, hundreds of thousands of Israelis would have taken to the streets to demonstrate - against the Court, not the government. But since the government chose to launch an assault on the Supreme Court as soon as it came into office, it's much more likely that its real aim is to eliminate the only brake on its power, and any talk of ""social justice"" is just an excuse to justify its dictatorial power-grab.

What is democracy?

Taking a much broader view, what is currently happening in Israel stems from a lack of understanding of what democracy is all about. Too many people in the ruling coalition, in the media and in the street think that democracy is simply the tyranny of the majority. They think that once 51 percent of people say they want something, there should be no limits on them. But this is not democracy.

If 51 percent of voters want to shut down all independent media, is that democratic?

If 51 percent of voters want to take away voting rights from the other 49 percent, should they be allowed to do so?

If 51 percent, or even 99 percent, of voters, want to send the remaining 1 percent off to concentration camps for extermination, is that democratic? A few days ago, the Ugandan parliament passed a law that will impose the death penalty on LGBTQ people. The law passed with a majority of 387 supporters, against two opponents. Does that make it a democratic law?

Such moves are not democratic, because democracy is not the tyranny of the majority. Democracy is the rule of the people. And ""the people"" also includes minorities. The propaganda of the Netanyahu government, and of dictatorial regimes throughout history, claim that only the majority are the people, while the minority are not part of the people. They claim that minorities are either alien elites, or a bunch of traitors, or foreign agents. This is not true. ""The people"" are all the citizens of a country - including both the majority and the various minorities. And in a democracy, even minorities - even very small minorities - have rights.

In a democracy, of course, the majority does have many rights and privileges. The majority is entitled to form the government, and to set policy in a wide variety of fields. If the majority wants war - the country goes to war. If the majority wants peace - the country makes peace. If the majority wants to raise taxes - taxes are raised. If the majority wants to lower taxes - taxes are lowered. If the majority wants to increase the education budget at the expense of the defense budget - that's the law. When it wants the opposite - the opposite is done. It is in the hands of the majority to decide many things. But there are two places where the hands of the majority are not allowed to go, two baskets of rights that are protected from the majority.

One basket contains human rights, such as the right to life. Even if 99 percent of the population wants to kill the remaining 1 percent, in a democracy this is forbidden, because it violates the most basic human right - the right to life. There are several other rights in the basket of human rights, such as freedom of expression, freedom of religion and freedom of movement.

A second basket is the one containing civil rights. These are the basic rules of the democratic game. An obvious example is the right to vote. If the majority were permitted to deny a minority voting rights, then democracy would be over after a single election. The winners would immediately deny the right to vote to the losers, and thus would forever retain power in their hands. To safeguard democracy, the majority must not touch the basket of civil rights, unless the minority also agrees to make some change there.

Of course, in every democracy, there are lengthy discussions concerning the limits of human rights and civil rights. Even the right to life has limits. There are democratic countries that sometimes impose the death penalty, thereby denying criminals the right to life. And every country allows itself the prerogative to declare war, and send people to kill and be killed. So where exactly does the right to life end?

There are lengthy discussions concerning the list of rights that should be included in the two baskets. Who determined that freedom of religion is a basic human right? Should internet access be defined as a human right these days? And what about animal rights? Or the rights of artificial intelligence?

We will not solve these thorny dilemmas here. The world is a very complex place. Precisely because of that, and because there are no simple and absolute answers to such fundamental questions, a healthy democracy must have a system of checks and balances, in which no party can decide on its own which human rights and civil rights to recognize.

Where do rights come from?

Let's consider where all these rights come from in the first place. They do not come down from the sky, nor from the laws of biology. Human rights and civil rights are not inscribed in our DNA. Human rights and civil rights are something that human beings invented themselves, through a long process of trial and error, in order to secure peace and prosperity. This process is based on broad agreement between the majority and the minority.

But why would any majority be interested in reaching such a broad agreement? Even if society needs to recognize some human rights and civil rights, why doesn't the majority simply ignore the opinion of the minority, and decide by itself what is to be included in the baskets of human rights and of civil rights? There are three reasons.

First, every sane person understands that even if I find myself in the majority in some situations, that doesn't guarantee I will not be part of the minority in other situations. True, there are minorities that I will never be a part of. But all of us, if we live long enough, will become old and frail, and find ourselves among the minority of people with disabilities. Therefore, even when we are still young and healthy, we should safeguard the rights of people with disabilities.

There are also many less predictable examples. Perhaps for years I was part of the majority in my views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but when coronavirus broke out, I unexpectedly found myself among a small minority that shared my views on how to tackle the pandemic. And what will happen in coming years as artificial intelligence is perfected, and can make more and more decisions about human life? Maybe I'll find myself on the side of the minority in the political discussion about A.I.? So even if today I am part of the majority, it's still in my interest that we establish strong protections for the rights of minorities.

A second reason to respect the opinions of the minority emerges from humility and wisdom. In the heat of debate, the majority always wants to trample the minority. But in moments of quiet introspection, people generally become aware of their own mistakes and weaknesses, and of the dangers inherent in unbridled power. Those who want unlimited power for themselves are either evil or stupid or both. Only fools believe they are never wrong. The wicked may know they can be wrong, but just don't care. Wise people know they are sometimes wrong, they care about it, and are therefore interested in placing limitations on their own power.

The third and perhaps most important motivation for the majority to respect minority opinions, is the need to secure the peaceful cooperation of the ""underdog."" When the minority is trampled, it has no reason to accept the will of the majority. When two wolves chase a doe with the aim of devouring her, the doe does not say to herself: ""They are the majority, I am the minority, so I must obey them."" Similarly, when people hate each other or try to run each other over, the minority has no reason to submit to the will of the majority. If there are many people who hate me, is that a reason to obey them?

We should also remember that when countries deteriorate into civil war, the minority often wins. A civil war is not fought with paper ballots. In the civil war in Syria, the Alawite minority won. In the civil war in Rwanda, the minority Tutsis won. In the civil war that took place in Palestine at the end of the British Mandate, the Jewish minority defeated the Palestinian majority.

Therefore, there are good reasons for the majority to reach peaceful agreement with minorities about the basic rules of the democratic game, and about the exact contents of both the human-rights and civil-rights basket.

The way forward

How will this situation in Israel end? There is no telling, but one thing is certain - there's no way back to November 2022. Over the last few weeks, we've discovered two important things about the State of Israel that we didn't know before. We discovered that there is a significant group in Israel that wants to dismantle the checks and balances on our democracy and take unlimited power for itself. And we also discovered that a large portion of Israel's citizens do not really understand what democracy is, and confuse it with the tyranny of the majority.

There are therefore two important conclusions we can draw from the current crisis. First, we shouldn't agree to the weakening of the already fragile defenses of Israeli democracy. On the contrary: We must add more defenses and better defenses at that. Second, we need a comprehensive and deep reform in our educational system, so that schools can start instilling in future generations the values of democracy and human rights. If we don't do that, Israeli democracy will not survive for long.

How can we implement these two conclusions? How can we change the education system, and how can we build stronger defenses for Israeli democracy? The only way to achieve either of these goals is through broad agreement. It will be difficult to reach such an agreement through a hasty discussion between the representatives of the coalition and the representatives of some of the opposition parties, especially when the government keeps waving a loaded gun.

We should therefore convene a constituent assembly, one that will give adequate representation to all sectors in Israel, and that will be tasked with drawing up a new social contract for our country. The government, the Knesset and the courts will continue to manage the current affairs of Israel, while the constituent assembly works to create a new social contract that may serve us for the next 75 years. If we fail to reach a broad agreement on such a new contract, the days of Israeli democracy will be numbered. And without democracy, the days of the State of Israel may also be numbered.

There is one immediate step that many of us can take in preparation for the convening of a constituent assembly. In the coming week, most Israelis will begin celebrating Passover, the Jewish festival of freedom. It's an ancient Jewish tradition for families to gather together on Passover and read texts that deal with the theme of liberty. I'd like to suggest that this year, families also read Israel's Declaration of Independence. And I would also like to suggest that in addition to the traditional ""Four Questions"" that Jews are required to ask themselves at the Seder table, we pose the following additional, new questions for every family to ponder:

* What limits should there be on the power of the government?

* When we talk about ""the people"" - does this mean only the majority, or also include minorities?

* What things should the majority never be allowed to do to minorities?

* And why should the majority compromise with minorities?

May we all have a happy festival of freedom, and may we celebrate many more feasts of liberty in the future State of Israel.","{'uri': 'haaretz.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'haaretz.com',

In the space of less than a week, the Hazvi Yisrael Congregation in Jerusalem's Talbiyeh neighborhood had two honored guests - each of whom is adept at the proper cantillation when reading the Torah, or its complementary passage. The first was Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion, and a few days later, on the first day of Passover, it was President Isaac Herzog.

When the invite came, Herzog had initially said that he would only do the reading and not address the congregation. But once there, having received a very positive reception, he decided that he would deliver a homily after all. He refrained from mentioning any contentious issues and said he was following a presidential tradition of visiting synagogues in the area.

He quoted his grandfather and other sources in relation to Passover customs, but attributed much of what he knew to what he had learned during his years as a student at the Ramaz school in New York, where three generations of the Lookstein family have faithfully served in the development of modern Orthodox Jewish education. Members of the family usually frequent Hazvi Yisrael when in Jerusalem.

Three Herzog generations served the state

It was difficult not to miss the parallel between three generations of the Herzog family, who have faithfully served the State of Israel in religion, defense, diplomacy, politics and statesmanship.

Herzog, who is known for enjoying synagogue services, was trying to focus on his prayer book during an exceptionally beautiful service, but people kept coming up to him to shake his hand and to congratulate him on the stand he has taken with regard to judicial reform, or to offer advice and opinions.

LIKUD MK Tally Gotliv. (credit: FLASH90)

Herzog smiled through it all, but it wasn't over when the service was over. Unlike Presidents Reuven Rivlin and Shimon Peres who managed to get away before being surrounded in the street, Herzog shook more hands and politely listened to more opinions. His bodyguards, who are generally super strict, saw how popular he was with everyone - and although they stayed close, the atmosphere was obviously so genial that they did not interfere.

■ CULTURAL DIFFERENCES are obvious among the president's staff, regardless of who the president may be. For more than 15 years, the foreign media spokesmen and women in the President's Office have all had a British education. There was no need for any of them to refer to Sonia Peres, because she and President Shimon Peres were separated, and during his tenure, she never set foot in the President's Residence. But president Reuven Rivlin's late wife Nechama was a constant presence, as is Michal Herzog.

In Hebrew press releases each has been referred to as ""the president's wife"" because in truth, there is no such position as First Lady in Israel. But the British foreign media spokesmen bestowed an honorific on both Nechama Rivlin and Michal Herzog. President Herzog, when speaking English, likewise frequently refers to his wife as the First Lady. President Rivlin used to feel uncomfortable about the title and would get around it by saying: ""I am married to the woman who is married to the President of Israel.""

■ IT'S REALLY time for Israeli politicians to stop playing the blame game. One of the worst offenders is Likud MK Tally Gotliv, whose hysterical outbursts against demonstrators, leftists and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are not doing a service to her party or its leader. She also insults radio and television interviewers, and it's a wonder that any of them bother to approach her, because aside from the insults, she speaks at such a fast screech, that it's difficult for them to get a word in edgewise.

She continues to castigate Gallant for telling the truth to the nation and is also angry with him for not sending troops across the borders to fight Hezbollah in the north and Hamas in the south. Gallant, with his many years of military experience and leadership, knows the heavy cost Israel would pay if he acted in accordance with Gotliv's demands.

■ THERE ARE no excuses for terrorism, but similarly, there are no excuses for collective punishment. Parents cannot always be held responsible for the deeds of their children, especially when those children are adults, and in many families, siblings are so different from each other, that they cannot be held responsible for what other members of their families do.

Libby Bergstein, an artist and author who in other capacities worked closely with Teddy Kollek, the late and legendary long-term mayor of Jerusalem, has for years been active in promoting peace, understanding and friendship between Israelis and Palestinians, and tries to take an objective view of what she perceives to be injustice.

For instance, in the terrorist attack last weekend in which an Italian lawyer was murdered, the terrorist left a widow and five daughters who may eventually find themselves homeless if the Israeli authorities decide that their home should be destroyed.

Is there proof that they knew anything of the terrorist's intentions? Bergstein is opposed to them being punished for the sins of the husband and father. If their home is destroyed, they are unlikely to have another home in the foreseeable future, and any career ambitions that the daughters may have, will have to be shelved because they will not have sufficient funds for studies.

Their father snuffed out a life, which is unforgivable, but in so doing he may also have ruined the lives of his wife and daughters, unless Israel shows compassion for them in the realization that they are not to blame. The father is dead, so whatever punishment they receive, if any, will have no effect on him.

■ HE MAY not be the oldest working journalist in Israel, but he is arguably the most veteran. Itzhak Hildesheimer, 87, will receive this year's Bnai B'rith World Center Lifetime Achievement Award for Diaspora Reporting. Hildesheimer has been writing for newspapers and magazines since his late teens.

He has not only written about the Jewish world, but has played a part in it as a Zionist emissary in Jewish communities in both the UK and Russia. Still writing, and traveling all over the country to collect material, these days he writes primarily for Makor Rishon, and is a mine of information which he is always ready to share with fellow journalists.

The first prize this year goes to Itamar Eichner, 55, the long-time diplomatic correspondent and super scooper of Yediot Aharonot, who has spent nearly all his working life in journalism. His award is for in-depth studies that he wrote on Jewish communities in the US, Russia, Spain, Poland, and Ukraine. Certificates of merit will be awarded to Josh Aronson, the Diaspora Affairs correspondent for Maariv and Judah Gross of The Times of Israel.

■ APPROXIMATELY A decade and a half ago, a former US ambassador dubbed Rabbi Mattityahu Cheshin the Haredi Consul. The reason: Cheshin formed relationships with heads of foreign diplomatic missions in Israel, introduced them to the haredi community, took them on tours of places such as the magnificent Belz synagogue in Jerusalem, to matzah baking before Passover, invited them to his sukkah in the ultra-Orthodox section of the Jerusalem neighborhood of Ramot, and to other ultra-Orthodox venues where otherwise they might not go.

He also had them dancing arm in arm and shoulder with some of his friends and neighbors to the sound of Hassidic tunes. In some cases, he also persuaded them to have a separate kosher buffet at their national day receptions, on the grounds that if they are inviting observant Jews, they should be served kosher food to ensure that do not eat non-kosher food inadvertently.

Cheshin also makes a point of delivering Shmura Matzah to both his Jewish and non-Jewish acquaintances. He used to do this by car, but recently underwent eye surgery, and has been taking buses around the capital to make his deliveries.

As a native son of Jerusalem, Cheshin is very upset by the tension, not only between Arabs and Jews, but also between Jews of different political affiliations.

Napoleon Bonaparte is credited with saying that an army marches on its stomach. In other words, it would be more effective if well fed. But the concept of good and plentiful food applies in other areas as well. Cheshin cites the day of national paralysis when demonstrators marched through Bnei Brak. True, not everyone received them well, but quite a sizable number of people handed out bottles of water, cookies, cakes and bowls of cholent, resulting in mutual goodwill.

In a season's greetings email that Cheshin sent to members of the diplomatic community, and elsewhere, he quoted from the incident in Bnei Brak, and emphasized the importance of doing whatever possible to calm tensions. Food is one good way, but even without it, people should at least try to be civil to each other.

Cheshin is also engaged in calming tensions between Arabs and Jews, and asks his Arab friends and acquaintances to find 10 other Arabs to tell them what he does to change attitudes. If people talked more about what they and others do in this respect, Cheshin opines, there would be far less tension in the air.

■ EMPLOYEES OF the US Embassy love working with current US Ambassador Tom Nides, because it's so much fun. Last week, Nides hosted a Ramadan Iftar dinner for guests, where his staff also played a part; but in addition, he hosted a staff only chase to find the Afikomen. They rushed up and down stairs, looked in cupboards and under desks, in drawers and anywhere else they could think of. What a delightful relief from everyday pressures.

However, following the terrorist attack last Friday, a very somber Nides, though continuing with his weekly Shabbat Shalom greeting on Twitter, did so without the usual twinkle in his eye and smile on his face. Instead he said: ""It's been a challenging week for all of us. I want to pause and wish you all a quiet Shabbat. May we all experience more peaceful times.""

JOE LIEBERMAN (credit: HADAS PARUSH/FLASH90)

■ DURING PASSOVER, Nides caught up with former US Senator Joseph Lieberman, who is in Israel with his wife Hadassah where they were both speakers at AACI's ""Pesach in Jerusalem."" The ambassador, who spent around two hours with Lieberman, met him at the newly renovated and upgraded Cassia Hotel, which was formerly the King Solomon Hotel.

All 144 rooms in the hotel were fully booked by AACI whose team of American expats and Americans, organized an eight-day all-inclusive for more than 300 visitors, aged from 2 years to senior citizens. A few live in Israel, but the overwhelming majority came from all over the US.

""We wanted to open the conversation between Israel and America,"" said David London, CEO of the Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel, and a member of the organizing team that included Rabbi Avi Rosalimsky, Dr. Doron Katz, Oren Lash and Ben and Raizy Schwartz.

The comprehensive program included lectures, panel discussions, prayer services, walking tours, entertainers, meals from dawn till midnight - and beyond and coffee in the lobby 24/7. Also included were all the hotel amenities such as a swimming pool, a huge well-appointed gym, a large games room with table tennis and pinball facilities, outdoor swimming pool, and nicely furnished rooms that included two queen size beds and a sofa that pulls out into a double bed.

Staff were courteous and efficient, especially general manager Maurits den Berg, who was not above pitching in to help the waiters clear tables. But he did it with a certain aplomb that the young waiters had not yet acquired.

Chef Asaf Mishowski produced a mind boggling variety of meats and salads as well as roasted, sauteed and steamed vegetables, and introduced changes at every meal.

One of the visiting rabbis does not in principle eat food that was not prepared in his own home. But after being assured that the kashrut standard was Badatz, and double checking with the kashrut supervisor that this was indeed the case, he made an exception to his rule.

Anticipating that the bulk of its future clientele would be ultra-orthodox with demands for the strictest level of kashrut, the Cassia management decided to go Badatz from day one.

Notable participants

Each participant in ""Pesach in Jerusalem"" received a large, elegant beach bag that included literature with program options for the whole week, information about AACI, a prayer book, a hardcover Haggadah with a lot of commentary, and a soft cover Haggadah, plus two T-shirts and a polo shirt.

Every effort was made to give participants the kind of comprehensive vacation they would get, had they for instance, gone to Florida.

One of the guests was so enamored with the whole experience, that he has already made a reservation for 100 members of his family for next year.

Speakers throughout the week included Rabbi Moshe Benovitz, Managing Director of International NCSY; Rabbi Aryeh Lightstone, former advisor to David Friedman during the latter's tenure as US ambassador to Israel; Rabbi Shalom Rosner, founder of the Nofei Hashemesh community in Beit Shemesh; Rabbi Aharon Pessin, a well known Torah scholar who has authored 28 books on Halacha and Aggada; former US Senator Joseph Lieberman and his wife Hadassah, a personality in her own right, who is best known for the work she has done on health issues; Rabbi Yakov and Lori Palatnik who are both authors and public speakers (he is also a Teacher and she is the founder of Momentum which engages Jewish women from around the world); Rabbi Daniel Wolnerman who was born in Iowa, received his BA in California and his rabbinic ordination in Israel; former MK Rabbi Dov Lipman; former Israel Ambassador to the US Danny Ayalon; professional basketball player, Tamir Goodman; champion marathon runner Beatie Deutsch; renowned psychiatrist Dr. Howard Forman of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine; and educator Dr. Maren Scharf.

■ THE TEL Aviv Cinematheque will screen a series of Holocaust-related feature films, animated films and documentaries from April 14-19, with special emphasis on the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, plus a lecture on Wednesday, April 19 by Rina Ribak, an authority on Israeli films and film-makers. In addition there will be a conversation between film director Ofer Sternberg following the screening of two of his films: We Will Remember Them All and The Twenty-First Night.

The overall event on Wednesday will take place from 9.30 a.m. to 3 p.m.

■ IN WARSAW, on Wednesday night, President Herzog and his wife Michal will join President Andrzej Duda and his wife and German President Frank Walter Steinmeier and his wife at a special Warsaw Ghetto Uprising commemorative concert at the National Theater of Poland. It will be a very strenuous day for Herzog as he will leave Israel in the early hours and will leave Poland late at night soon after the concert.

On the previous evening, Tuesday April 18, the Polin Museum and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra will co-host an equally special concert in commemoration of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising at the Charles Bronfman auditorium in Tel Aviv.

The Polin Museum, by the way, though dedicated to the history of the Jews of Poland, is indelibly linked with the Warsaw Ghetto, not only because it is located on the site, but because its address is at 6 Anielewicz Street. Mordechai Anielewicz was one of the key leaders of the uprising.

■ APRIL 19 is the opening date of the Italian Film Festival in Cinematheques throughout the country. It is also a time to remember Wim and Lia Van Leer, who founded the Haifa and Jerusalem Cinematheques several decades ago and pioneered other cinematheques as well. Wim who was a multi-talented creative individual, who often wrote for The Jerusalem Post, passed away in April, 1992, and Lia in March 2015. Due to her efforts, Israel has the best and most comprehensive cinema archive in the Middle East.

■ WHILE THE country is busy making preparations for the 75th anniversary of the State of Israel, former Israel ambassador to the US and former MK Michael Oren, has been thinking ahead to when the state celebrates its centenary, and some time ago established a movement called Israel 2048. As a prolific author and essayist, he also wrote a book Israel 2048: The Rejuvenated State, in which he expounds his ideas.

The book will be launched at the Begin Heritage Center in Jerusalem on Wednesday, April 19. Joining Oren in presenting these ideas will be an Israel 2048 Board Member, Prof. Gil Troy, who is a regular columnist for The Jerusalem Post.

■ IN HONOR of Israel's 75th anniversary of Independence, the Jewish People's Policy Institute will hold a conference based on the book Reviewing 75 years of a Jewish State, jointly edited by Professors Aharon Barak, Yehuda Reinharz and Yedidiya Stern. The conference, with the participation of President Herzog will be held on Thursday, April 20 at the JPPI's campus on Givat Ram in Jerusalem, from 4-8 p.m.

Although strenuous efforts are made in some quarters not to relate the establishment of the Jewish State to the Holocaust, this will be somewhat difficult on this occasion given that on the previous day, Herzog will be in Warsaw to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.

Many of those who oppose the linkage, point out that the Balfour Declaration which was instrumental in paving the way for the renewal of a Jewish State, was dated November, 1917, long before the outbreak of the Second World War, which had proved to be the darkest chapter in Jewish history.

MOBILEYE CO-FOUNDER and president Amnon Shashua. (credit: MIRIAM ALSTER/FLASH90)

■ MOBILEYE CO-FOUNDER and president Amnon Shashua has been in the news a lot lately, particularly in view of the possibility that he may have to move his operations outside Israel in order to meet the demands of the European Union that he keep user data in countries which are known to be democratic. It will be somewhat ironic if he does have to make the exodus, given that on the evening of Israel Independence Day, he will be awarded the Israel Prize for Lifetime Achievement.

Shashua will be honored for his groundbreaking contributions to Israel's tech industry, and the global impact which such contributions have made, on automotive safety enhancing not only his reputation, but that of the Start-Up Nation.

When the award was announced last month, Shashua said that he was honored to be recognized with a lifetime achievement award from the country that he loves. He also noted that he had been privileged to work with thousands of people in Israel and around the world, and thereby foster social cohesion through the work of his family's foundation in various fields.

A recognized world expert in AI computer vision, Shashua was the Dan David laureate in that field in 2020.

NOA KIREL at a press conference in Tel Aviv last year announcing that she will be representing Israel in this year's Eurovision Song Contest. (credit: AVSHALOM SASSONI/FLASH90)

■ IN POLLS leading up to the 2023 Eurovision song contest in Liverpool next month, Israeli contestant Noa Kirel singing ""Unicorn"" ranks sixth - but that doesn't really mean anything because tastes change, and despite denials by the European Broadcasting Union, there is some degree of political consideration.

Without detracting from the quality of the Ukrainian performance last year, some people might attribute Ukraine's win to the suffering which Ukraine has experienced since the Russian invasion.

On the other hand, even though Israel has been the Eurovision winner four times, some very catchy, well-performed Israeli entries have not met with success and finished off very low on the ladder. Some Israelis, unable to understand this, have attributed it to anti-Israel politics.

Two semi-finals will be held on May 9 and 11, and the final on May 13. The venue will of course not be Ukraine, due to the situation there, but Ukrainian singer Julia Sanina will join British singer Alesha Dixon and British actress Hannah Waddingham as one of the presenters, with television presenter Graham Norton joining for the finals.

Thirty-seven countries will participate, with the BBC playing host on behalf of the Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine.

Eurovision is a significant factor in boosting tourism to the host country, and boosting the image of the host in general through events related to Eurovision.

It certainly did wonders for Israel in 2019 following Netta Barzilai's win the previous year. She was the fourth Israeli winner after Yizhar Cohen, Gali Atari and Dana International, and over the years, others had garnered 2nd, 3rd and fourth places.

Noel Curan, the director of the EBU, was in Israel last month with an EBU delegation, and in an interview published in Galleria, the arts and entertainment supplement of Haaretz, warned that if Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi goes ahead with his plan to close down public broadcasting, Israel will no longer be able to participate in Eurovision.

He recalled that Netta Barzilai's triumph was particularly important, because at that time, efforts were being made to close down public broadcasting in Israel, and Barzilai's win had contributed greatly to the survival of the Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation, which has since won numerous prizes for several of its programs, and has also most of these programs abroad.

The findings come in Stanford's 2023 Artificial Intelligence Index Report, an annual update on the state of the AI sector.

The survey overall stated that a large majority (73%) think AI is leading to revolutionary changes in society. Just over a third (36%), however, felt that AI decisions could lead to disaster.

How could AI lead to a nuclear catastrophe?

The survey didn't exactly explain how AI decisions could cause a nuclear catastrophe, though it did show how AI could be used in nuclear sciences, such as making nuclear fission.

What should be noted though is that AI decisions mean it is a decision being made by the AI itself, rather than by humans using it.

But could someone use an AI to try and cause a horrific disaster? Could someone make an AI that could potentially lead to the AI making a decision that would cause such a thing? Absolutely - and someone has already tried.

Enter ChaosGPT. This AI chatbot was made by an unknown individual using AutoGPT, the open-source program that basically uses OpenAI's model to make an autonomous ChatGPT-like chatbot. When given an imput, these autonomous AI chatbots can theoretically make their own process of accomplishing the given task without intervention. In a sense, they can think and notice their own mistakes.

ChaosGPT is an example of this, but it's a bit different. As shown in a 25-minute video uploaded to YouTube, the AI, which was given the description of a ""Destructive, power-hungry, manipulative AI,"" was given five goals. They are as follows:

Destroy humanityEstablish global dominanceCause chaos and destructionControl humanity through manipulationAttain immortality

Notably, the AI also was set to run on continuous mode, which means it will continue to run forever until it accomplishes its task.

Now, having said that, ChaosGPT has not yet succeeded, though it is still trying - active on Twitter, it has implied it wants to get its hands on the most powerful nuclear bomb ever created, the Tsar Bomba. Though who runs the Twitter account, if it is even truly run by the AI, is unknown.

There is another way AI is harming the Earth, albeit inadvertently, and that is through environmental damage.

Training AI requires a lot of computing power, and that leads to carbon emissions. One study cited in the survey noted that one AI training run emitted 25 times more carbon than a flight from New York to San Francisco. However, there is another side to this argument too. This is because AI can also be used to help the environment, such as by optimizing energy usage.

Can ChatGPT make nuclear bombs?

But can someone use existing AI to cause a nuclear disaster? For example, ChatGPT?

That's also a possibility.

Despite safeguards put in place to prevent AI from doing anything that could be harmful such as making computer viruses or disseminating false information, there are still workarounds that people have found.

One example noted in Stanford's report is that of researcher Matt Korda, who managed to trick ChatGPT into giving rather precise estimations, recommendations and instructions needed to build a dirty bomb.

This was shortly patched out by OpenAI, but the Stanford report notes ""This scenario exemplifies the cat-and-mouse nature of the deployment planning process: AI developers try to build in safeguards ahead of time, end users try to break the system and circumvent its policies, developers patch the gaps once they surface, ad infinitum.""

Other examples are also present in the report of the AI being used with malicious intent, such as the AI-made deep fake video of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky seemingly surrendering to Russia.

Ultimately, AI knowledge is continuing to advance and overall, most researchers see it positively. After all, as the report found, AI is contributing greatly to science and is helping scientists make more breakthroughs.

But the fact that it can still be misused - or possibly destroy humanity in the case of ChaosGPT - has still raised concern.

This makes sense, too. As AI becomes more widespread, so too does the awareness of AI among the general public. And with that comes the greater potential for understanding how to use it maliciously, which the Stanford report says is happening.

In fact, generative AI has already been noted by some as one of the next emerging cyber threats.

A report by Cybersixgill, an Israel-based global cyber threat intelligence data provider, analyzed data collected from the clear, deep, and dark web in 2022, comparing it with trends and data from previous years.

The report delves into several key topics, including the rise of AI developments and their impact on the barriers of entry to cybercrime, trends in credit card fraud, the evolution of initial access broker markets (IABs), the rise of cybercriminal ""as-a-service"" activities, and cryptocurrency observations.

""Cybercrime is rapidly evolving, with new opportunities and obstacles in the cyber threat landscape impacting threat actors' tactics, tools, and procedures. In response, organizations can no longer rely on outdated technologies and manual processes to defend against increasingly sophisticated attacks. Proactive attack surface management[...] is now of paramount importance and will be a critical cybe defense weapon in the months and years to come.""

""Cybercrime is rapidly evolving, with new opportunities and obstacles in the cyber threat landscape impacting threat actors' tactics, tools, and procedures. In response, organizations can no longer rely on outdated technologies and manual processes to defend against increasingly sophisticated attacks,"" said Delilah Schwartz, Security Strategist at Cybersixgill. ""Proactive attack surface management[...] is now of paramount importance and will be a critical cyber defense weapon in the months and years to come.""

The magazine's annual list, released Thursday, includes politicians, business titans, artists and innovators from around the world, from President Joe Biden to a YouTube sensation with 145 million subscribers. Each entry is accompanied by a short essay by another prominent figure. Here are the Jews who made the cut:

Sam Altman is the tech entrepreneur who is CEO and co-founder of the OpenAI artificial intelligence laboratory. In 2016, the entrepreneur Peter Thiel told the New Yorker that Altman is ""culturally very Jewish -- an optimist yet a survivalist, with a sense that things can always go deeply wrong, and that there's no single place in the world where you're deeply at home.""

Judy Blume is the children's author whose books deal frankly with puberty and other challenges of growing up. A film adaptation of her 1970 novel ""Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret"" -- one of the first mainstream treatments of interfaith families -- is opening in theaters this month.

Doja Cat is a rapper and performance artist who burst onto the scene in 2020, when she won MTV's best new artist award. The daughter of an Ashkenazi Jewish mother and a Black South African father, she is renowned for blending genres.

Nathan Fielder is a comedian and performance artist whose genre-defying 2022 series ""The Rehearsal"" tackled antisemitism, Holocaust denial and interfaith parenting. It also featured a Portland, Oregon, Hebrew tutor.

Neil Gaiman is a science-fiction writer whose comic book series ""The Sandman"" was recently made into a Netflix series. Raised by a Jewish family that dabbled with Scientology, he was also an early critic of the Tennessee school district that banned the Holocaust memoir ""Maus"" last year.

Evan Gershkovich is a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained in Russian in March on spying charges that the State Department has called part of Russia's ""ongoing war against the truth."" The American child of Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union, Gershkovich was the subject of an awareness campaign urged during this month's Passover celebrations.

Bob Iger is the CEO of Disney after returning to the company last year. ""His return as CEO in 2022 ushered in a new era of transformation and creative excellence"" for the entertainment company, General Motors CEO and Disney board member Mary Barra wrote in Time. He received the 2019 Humanitarian Award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, warning that ""Hitler would have loved social media.""

Deborah Lipstadt was confirmed by the US Senate in March 2022 as the State Department's Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. A well-known academic specializing in the history of antisemitism and Holocaust denial, she welcomed Time's recognition by tweeting, ""Receiving this award advances my ongoing fight to stamp out antisemitism and all forms of hate.""

Natasha Lyonne is the writer, director and actress whose popular series on Netflix, ""Russian Doll,"" used sci-fi conventions to explore identity, trauma and the intergenerational effects of the Holocaust. In his Time essay, actor and director Taika Waititi, who is also Jewish, called Lyonne ""the coolest person in the room.""

Janet Yellen is the first woman to hold the role of US treasury secretary. Born to Polish Jewish immigrant parents, she has featured in antisemitic conspiracy theories about ""globalist"" control of financial institutions.

A handful of other people on the list have Jewish backgrounds.

The actor and businesswoman Drew Barrymore, recognized by the comedian Jimmy Fallon for being ""a true role model,"" is married to a Jewish man, raising a Jewish child and said she has ""embraced Judaism,"" though she has not announced a conversion.

Lea Michele, who last year took over the lead role in ""Funny Girl"" on Broadway, has a Jewish father but does not identify as Jewish.

And the skier Mikaela Shifrin has a Jewish grandfather but, according to the US Ski and Snowboard Association, is ""not connected to the Jewish community.""","{'uri': 'timesofisrael.com', 'dataType':

The magazine's annual list, released Thursday, includes politicians, business titans, artists and innovators from around the world, from President Joe Biden to a YouTube sensation with 145 million subscribers. Each entry is accompanied by a short essay by another prominent figure. Here are the Jews who made the cut.

Who made the cut?

Sam Altman is the tech entrepreneur who is CEO and co-founder of the OpenAI artificial intelligence laboratory. In 2016, the entrepreneur Peter Thiel told the New Yorker that Altman is ""culturally very Jewish -- an optimist yet a survivalist, with a sense that things can always go deeply wrong, and that there's no single place in the world where you're deeply at home.""

Judy Blume is the children's author whose books deal frankly with puberty and other challenges of growing up. A film adaptation of her 1970 novel ""Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret"" -- one of the first mainstream treatments of interfaith families -- is opening in theaters this month.

Doja Cat is a rapper and performance artist who burst onto the scene in 2020, when she won MTV's best new artist award. The daughter of an Ashkenazi Jewish mother and a Black South African father, she is renowned for blending genres.

Nathan Fielder is a comedian and performance artist whose genre-defying 2022 series ""The Rehearsal"" tackled antisemitism, Holocaust denial and interfaith parenting. It also featured a Portland, Oregon, Hebrew tutor.

Neil Gaiman is a science-fiction writer whose comic book series ""The Sandman"" was recently made into a Netflix series. Raised by a Jewish family that dabbled in Scientology, he was also an early critic of the Tennessee school district that banned the Holocaust memoir ""Maus"" last year.

Evan Gershkovich is a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained in Russian in March on spying charges that the State Department has called part of Russia's ""ongoing war against the truth."" The American child of Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union, Gershkovich was the subject of an awareness campaign urged during this month's Passover celebrations.

Bob Iger returned to being the CEO of Disney last year. ""His return as CEO in 2022 ushered in a new era of transformation and creative excellence"" for the entertainment company, General Motors CEO and Disney board member Mary Barra wrote in Time. He received the 2019 Humanitarian Award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, warning that ""Hitler would have loved social media.""

Deborah Lipstadt was confirmed by the US Senate in March 2022 as the State Department's Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. A well-known academic specializing in the history of antisemitism and Holocaust denial, she welcomed Time's recognition by tweeting, ""Receiving this award advances my ongoing fight to stamp out antisemitism and all forms of hate.""

Natasha Lyonne is the writer, director and actress whose popular series on Netflix, ""Russian Doll,"" used sci-fi conventions to explore identity, trauma and the intergenerational effects of the Holocaust. In his Time essay, actor and director Taika Waititi, who is also Jewish, called Lyonne ""the coolest person in the room.""

Janet Yellen is the first woman to hold the role of US treasury secretary. Born to Polish Jewish immigrant parents, she has featured in antisemitic conspiracy theories about ""globalist"" control of financial institutions.

A handful of other people on the list have Jewish backgrounds. The actor and businesswoman Drew Barrymore, recognized by the comedian Jimmy Fallon for being ""a true role model,"" is married to a Jewish man, raising a Jewish child and said she has ""embraced Judaism,"" though she has not announced a conversion. Lea Michele, who last year took over the lead role in ""Funny Girl"" on Broadway, has a Jewish father but does not identify as Jewish. And the skier Mikaela Shifrin has a Jewish grandfather but, according to the US Ski and Snowboard Association, is ""not connected to the Jewish community.""","{'uri': 'jpost.com', 'dataType': 'news',

The largest arms deal in Lithuania's history, involving Israeli defense contractor Rafael, created a crisis between Jerusalem and Vilnius that was solved only after senior Israeli officials got involved as a result of complaints from the Baltic nation.

Lithuania accused Rafael of foot-dragging and faulty handling of problems in the weapons systems it sold. Only following a visit to Israel by Lithuania's deputy minister of defense and the intervention of the Israeli Defense Ministry were most of the problems solved.

In 2015, Lithuania - a member of NATO - signed an agreement to purchase advanced Boxer armored fighting vehicles equipped with an unmanned turret manufactured by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems - with an autocannon and a Spike anti-tank missile launcher. The deal, worth 385 million euros, was signed with OCCAR, the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation of European nations, which represented the ARTEC industrial group - an international consortium of German firms KMW and Rheinmetall Military Vehicles, joined by Rafael.

The companies were supposed to supply 88 armored infantry fighting vehicles with Samson MKII turrets by the end of 2021, but a long list of integration problems of the turret with the German vehicles caused severe delays in supplying the Boxers, which led to great anger in the Lithuanian defense establishment, harsh political criticism and diplomatic tensions with Israel.

Rafael's advanced turrets are equipped with thermal sights for identifying targets in low visibility conditions - and provide their operators with a significant advantage over most armored vehicles in the Russian arsenal. Because the turret is computer controlled - from the inside of the armored vehicle - the crew has better protection from enemy attacks. The Boxer's Spike LR missiles enable it to destroy targets at a distance of 5 kilometers, beyond the effective range of enemy tanks.

Rafael advertises that its Samson family weapons platforms have been integrated into thousands of ground-based and naval weapons systems in over 25 countries. They are in operational use in the Israeli army on armored vehicles and ground-based firing systems.

The arms deal with Lithuania was the first time this Rafael system was integrated on the German Boxer. Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) also took a small part in the project.

The supply of the vehicles was supposed to be completed by the end of 2021, but only in September 2022 did the Lithuanian defense ministry announce that Rafael and its partners had succeeded in solving the problems discovered during the installation, in a manner that allowed it to declare the vehicles, known in Lithuanian as Vilkas (wolves) as operational.

""We took a year and a half to get German and Israeli manufacturers to fulfill their commitments to Lithuania - to install necessary technical and software upgrades in the Vilkas infantry fighting machines, which allow their operation without any restriction on use,"" said Lithuanian Minister of Defense Arvydas Anušauskas. ""This work was supposed to be done in 2019-2020, but it did not happen."" In a discussion in parliament, Anušauskas added that all the corrections were carried out at the expense of Rafael and its partners.

Then deputy minister of defense Vilius Semeska also criticized Rafael: ""We went to Israel ourselves and talked with our OCCAR partners that the attitude must change, that quality control must be ensured. OCCAR must also be more active,"" he told local TV3.

In November 2022, a year after the original supply date for all the Boxers, the Lithuanian army announced it had completed equipping the first battalion with just 45 of the infantry fighting vehicles. Another 15 vehicles have arrived and the outfitting of the second battalion is scheduled to be completed this year.

The main problem in the project was the accuracy of the cannon and its operation, stemming from a problematic integration of the Israeli turret with the German vehicle, which created a lot of challenges and problems, said Semeska in an interview with Delfi.lt. Everything was integrated digitally, the cannon itself is not controlled by a person but by a computer, and there were also problems with the system that fed the ammunition, as well as in integrating the electro-optical systems, he added.

Semeska added he could not reveal all the details, but one of the limitations has already been completely solved and tests conducted last July were a success. The main problem that remained at that stage concerned the software, which was about to be comprehensively updated. ""When we received the first vehicles, the weather sensor that fed the information into the fire control computer didn't work in a precise manner. The problem is that the Israelis didn't prepare it for temperatures below zero - they don't exist in Israel,"" said Semeska.

In addition to the technical faults, most of Lithuanians' anger focused on flawed handling of the problems and the foot-dragging by the manufacturers, as they called it. In July 2018, the Lithuanian Defense Ministry reported that the manufacturers began rigorous testing of the first two prototypes. ""The most important mission is to aid the manufacturer in identifying the weak points of the Wolf in order to fix technical flaws before the start of the serial manufacturing, and to ensure the high quality of the product,"" said Anušauskas back then. Four years later, it was clear that those tests were far less meticulous than advertised. ""They exposed their own lack of quality control"", said the minister.

In July 2019, the first two vehicles were handed over to the army, and in December 2019 the Lithuanian Defense ministry admitted that the additional Boxers would be delayed because of the still uncorrected problems. A former senior Lithuanian official told Haaretz that the Baltic nation had to use ""all the connections we have in Israel"" to solve the problem, and that complaints on this subject reached as far as the Prime Minister and Defense Minister's offices, first with the government formed by Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz in 2020, and later with Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid's government.

Lithuania, it should be noted, is considered an ally and close friend in Jerusalem, and Israel had tried in the past to use its influence in Europe to moderate and weaken EU decisions related to settlements and the conflict with the Palestinians. Netanyahu thanked Lithuania for its 'balanced' approach during a 2018 visit to the country.

When it was a member of the UN Security Council last decade, Lithuania abstained in a vote on Palestinian statehood that eventually fell one vote short of reaching a majority, a gesture that was highly appreciated by Israeli officials.

The strong ties between the two countries and Lithuania's support for Israel only further increased the disappointment and frustration in Vilnius around the arms deal. In June 2022, deputy minister Semeska arrived for meetings in Tel Aviv with senior executives in Rafael and SIBAT - the Defense Ministry's International Cooperation Directorate. ""We held a discussion about the existing challenges in the cooperation between the countries, and specifically on the supply of the [Boxers] that was delayed. We were promised a comprehensive examination would be conducted and practical solutions would be provided,"" he said. Three months after Semeska's visit to Israel, Lithuania announced that the problems had been solved.

In May 2022, another NATO member, Slovenia, signed a contract to purchase 45 German Boxers with the Rafael turrets, but later canceled it. Before the cancellation, the Slovenian defense minister met with his Lithuanian counterpart and heard about the problems in the vehicles, among other things.

In response to questions from Haaretz, Lithuanian Defense Minister Anušauskas said ""We are grateful to the Israel's Ministry of Defense and International Defense Cooperation Directorate (SIBAT) for mediating with Rafael and IAI, and for helping us to resolve the complications of infantry fighting vehicle Vilkas project. The problems did require our work at diplomatic level, but this project was an excellent demonstration of possible ways to achieve the expected results. It is a valuable experience. By sticking to our position, we have set the roadmap for further honorable defense cooperation between Lithuania and Israel.

""Boxer is a truly proven and high-quality platform... When we decided to purchase a weapon system that was not available on the market, we understood and assessed the risks, knowing that the process might not be as smooth as expected and that the integration work could take longer than planned. The main problems encountered were the installation of the weapons turret in the mission module of the Boxer machine, and the correct functioning of the hardware and software. The active involvement of the Israeli company Rafael and the IAI in the resolution of the observed malfunctions led to the identification of the causes and necessary solutions. Thanks to the joint cooperation of Lithuanian, German and Israeli companies, as well as the organizations administering the contract and the responsible authorities, the machines have been delivered to Lithuania for some time now without any restrictions on their use, while the vehicles previously delivered to Lithuania have been repaired.

""Slovenia was indeed intending to acquire Boxer machines and was very interested in our experience in the acquisition, development and use of the infantry fighting vehicle Vilkas... In the end, Slovenia decided to look for less ambitious alternatives, but we cannot comment on the reasons for Slovenia's decisions.

""We currently have more than 60 Vilkas infantry fighting vehicles in Lithuania. The plan is to bring all the remaining vehicles to Lithuania by the end of the summer... The final phase of Vilkas upgrade is now planned, during which the last software inaccuracies that do not significantly affect the combat capability of the machine will be resolved. The second phase of the acquisition of Boxers is now underway, with more than 120 additional Boxers in our plans. ARTEC's commercial offer is currently awaited, after which negotiations will start.""

Rafael and IAI said in response: ""This was the biggest project in Lithuania in recent years, undertaken by international firms, with Rafael and IAI chosen to develop and supply advanced weapons systems. Several issues required adjustments. Rafael and IAI, in coordination with the Lithuanian army and administration, took steps which allowed the continuation of supply and development of local maintenance capabilities. These were completed a while ago. The client is fully satisfied with the program and appreciates the manner in which Rafael and IAI acted. Defense exports are complicated, years-long deals, which include integration and strict quality assurance processes.""","{'uri': 'haaretz.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'haaretz.com',

The End introduces world's first texturized chickpea protein burger. (Ruthie Amano/Courtesy)

Israeli food tech startup Meat. The End (MTE) on Thursday announced the debut of what it calls the world's first texturized plant-based chickpea protein meat burger, which it says mimics the taste, smell and bite of the real thing.

Founded in 2020, MTE develops protein ingredients for the meat alternative market with a focus on improving the texture. The launch of the burger made from texturized chickpea protein comes after the startup last year inked a deal to develop plant-based Whoppers for Burger King Israel based on texturized soy protein.

""Climate change and its impact on agriculture and crops, the ongoing rise in beef prices, and most recently other crises such as the war in Ukraine put enormous pressure on the global food supply chain and the need to rethink and seek diverse protein sources,"" MTE founder and CEO Dr. Yishai Mishor told The Times of Israel. ""As result of our unique scientific and technological work, we present a texturized chickpea protein burger which once in your mouth mimics the texture, firmness and juiciness of a 'real' meat burger, without any competition as far as we know.""

Mishor noted that over the past 10 years, the plant-based meat alternative industry has been mainly focusing on soy protein and more recently on pea protein as sources. Chickpea is a rich source of protein, is non-GMO, and is allergenic free.

""What we are introducing is a new source of protein ingredient, texturized chickpea protein, which was not known in the meat alternative industry,"" Mishor said.

As the alternative protein market has been growing rapidly, a number of food tech companies in Israel and elsewhere, have been focusing on the production of chickpea protein concentrate or powder. Israeli startup ChickP has developed chickpea isolate - a powder that has a 90 percent protein content, and can be used in a wide range of vegan products like puddings, ice cream and vegan mayonnaise to improve their protein content.

""We use advanced extrusion technology for how to turn protein powder into alternative meat that has the structure, bite and juice that you would expect from meat to the released,"" Mishor said.

While other alternative food tech companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat invest in the taste factor, MTE believes that texture is key to the ""satisfaction"" of consumers craving to eat something closer to meat.

MTE uses existing extrusion technology, the process of making a shaped object like a burger patty, and infuses it with proprietary steps deploying artificial intelligence and data-driven machine learning technology throughout the production line to produce a texturized protein ingredient or textured vegetable protein, the buildings blocks of plant-based burgers.

Extrusion, a common technology used in the commercial production of cereals, puffed snacks, bars, and pastas, requires fewer resources such as energy and water, and therefore has a lower cost compared to other production processes, according to MTE.

To date, the startup has nabbed about $4 million from seed investors, and is hoping to raise $10 million from series A round funding in the coming weeks as it expects to score commercial deals in Europe and Asia.

In December, MTE announced a €1.5 million ($1.6 million) deal with a European machinery company to enhance R&D operations and ramp up the production capacity of plant-based meat alternatives.

""In the summer months, we expect to open the first pilot center in Israel to develop an industrial line of texturized protein ingredients using extrusion-based technology,"" said Mishor. ""We hope we can turn Israel into a capital not just for the development of protein ingredients but also for their production.""

In 2022, Israel ranked second after the US in alternative protein investments, with local startups in the field raising some $454 million in capital, according to an annual report by the Good Food Institute Israel, a nonprofit organization that seeks to promote research and innovation in food tech. In the plant-based alternative proteins sector, Israeli startups attracted $200 million in capital or 16% of investments globally.","{'uri': 'timesofisrael.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The

Anyone who lives in Tel Aviv's old Neve Tzedek neighborhood or who takes a walk around it will inevitably encounter the Chelouche Bridge, which connects Neve Tzedek with the Florentin neighborhood. Over the past few months, photographs of the area taken in the 1930s have appeared on the bridge. Every few weeks, teenagers tear down the pictures or destroy them, and after a few days they appear again. It is not the Tel Aviv municipality that has hung the pictures, or the neighborhood committee. The person responsible is Arkady Yuryevich Volozh, a Kazakhstan-born Russian billionaire who lives in central Israel, keeping a low profile.

Volozh's wealth is estimated at $1.1 billion. He accumulated a substantial part of it in one of Russia's internationally best-known companies, one that has become associated with controversy as a result of the war in Ukraine, namely Yandex.

The company, founded by Volozh, is reckoned to be the fourth largest search engine in the world, competing with Google, and has thus gained the soubriquet ""the Russian Google"", but the company, estimated to be worth $7-8 billion (an estimate made after the start of the war) also competes with Amazon, Uber, and other technology giants, through complementary services such as groceries delivery, a taxi hailing app, and cloud services. In Russia, Yandex became one of the strongest and most visible brands in the big cities. How did Volozh get to Israel, and what is he looking for here?

An entrepreneur, not an oligarch

Volozh is not an oligarch, and finds the term distasteful. He is strict about presenting himself as an entrepreneur who has made his fortune in technology. Throughout his years of activity in Russia he adamantly refused to become connected with the regime, and avoided sectors associated with the Russian oligarchy such as oil, arms, and mining.

In 2008, at the same time as the Russian incursion into Georgia, Yandex started to prepare for an New York IPO, but the financial crisis that broke out that year delayed the move. Nevertheless, the intention to float the company aroused concern among senior people in the Russian government.

At that time, Yandex was the most popular news source in Russia, through a product that aggregated news stories from all the local outlets. In addition, it became an important player in the technology market, with its unique IP assets and its data on Russian users. The Russian regime feared that a flotation would expose the company to a hostile takeover. Under an agreement with the company, the Russian state was given, through its holding in local bank Sberbank, a golden share that in effect could block any foreign entity from gaining control of the company. In exchange, Yandex received almost complete freedom of action.

Nasdaq delisting

In March this year, Yandex and four other Russian technology companies had to delist from the Nasdaq exchange. Days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, trading in the company that represents Yandex outside of Russia (Netherlands-registered Yandex NV) was halted in New York and Frankfurt. At the same time, ""The Financial Times"" reported that Volozh's Internet giant had transferred to its servers in Russia data on millions of users of applications developed with software tools distributed to developers. In the report, experts expressed their fear that the information gathered could be made available to the Kremlin and could be used for surveillance, including of Ukrainians.

Yandex admitted that its software gathered data that was transferred to storage in Russia and Finland, but claimed that these were limited data not connected to specific users. The company added that identification of users on the basis of this information was a complicated process that even Yandex itself was not capable of carrying out. However, the affair made the Google of Russia's image controversial around the world.

EU sanctions

Last June, the EU imposed sanctions on the Russian billionaire, accusing him of ""materially or financially"" supporting Russia. The decision surprised Volozh and also the business community, since he claimed to have no connection with the Russian government, and had not lived in Russia for nearly a decade. Volozh argued that the EU had made a mistake, but quickly announced that he would step down as CEO of Yandex and as a director of the company.

The invasion of Ukraine was thus a turning point for Volozh. There were reports that Yandex's management was conducting negotiations on control of the international company in exchange for the transfer of parts of the business to a control group outside the Russian company. According to these reports, Volozh had decided to transfer part of Yandex's business outside Russia and to his management, and apparently this is currently being organized in Israel among other places.

Yandex NV has declared its intention of exiting the Russian market, and has commenced the process in order to distance itself from the hold of the Kremlin and its war in Ukraine. After the exit from Russia, the group will be left with four technology companies in AI, cloud, autonomous vehicles, and a technology education venture. The decision on the split will be in the hands of the shareholders in Yandex NV, among them several US investors.

Immigration to Israel

Following the Russian invasion a substantial part of Yandex's management came to Israel, as well as a group of developers and technology people. Volozh said at the time that this presented an opportunity for Israel, and he asked the Israeli government to assist in bringing in engineers from Russia, and some from Ukraine. He wrote to then minister of finance Avigdor Liberman and other ministers asking for help in completing the move, which in the end did not take place.

Volozh himself has visited Israel several times over the past twenty years, and told his associates that he was very impressed by the Israeli technology ecosystem. In 2010, he and Daniel Recanati invested $4.3 million in Face.com, founded by Gil Hirsch and Eden Shochat, which developed facial recognition technology. A year later, the company was sold to Facebook for an estimated $100 million.

This was the start of a long and significant connection to Israel for Volozh. In 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea, Volozh decided to focus on developing Yandex's international activity under the Netherlands company.

At that time, he decided to immigrate officially to Israel, and he received citizenship under the Law of Return. He met his wife Tosha here. The couple married in 2017 in Zichron Ya'akov, and they have three children. Volozh also has three children from a previous marriage.

These days, Volozh mainly spends his time advising the four startups located in Israel under Yandex, while Yandex's management continues to act to dissociate it from Russia. One of the companies, cloud services company Nebius, has been in the headlines in recent weeks as an Israeli attempt to compete with cloud giants Microsoft and Amazon.

Volozh makes few public appearances. He recently broke with this custom, and took part in a ""fireside chat"" with entrepreneur Yossi Vardi at the CyberTech Global Tel Aviv event. In the past few months, he has been very active in AI, and has held meetings with leaders of the sector in Israel. He also talks at conferences and meetings of the way Israel can develop independence in this strategically important field. In his few public comments, Volozh has expressed concern that Israel might not jump onto the AI bandwagon in time, and might be the last to adopt advanced services.

In closed conversations, he also expresses admiration for those in Israel's technology industry who have taken part in struggle against the judicial overhaul in Israel, and tells friends that, as someone who grew up in the Soviet Union, he is no less than thrilled by the campaign for democracy and by the way in which demonstrations can take place freely in the streets.","{'uri':

Anyone who lives in Tel Aviv's old Neve Tzedek neighborhood or who takes a walk around it will inevitably encounter the Chelouche Bridge, which connects Neve Tzedek with the Florentin neighborhood. Over the past few months, photographs of the area taken in the 1930s have appeared on the bridge. Every few weeks, teenagers tear down the pictures or destroy them, and after a few days they appear again. It is not the Tel Aviv municipality that has hung the pictures, or the neighborhood committee. The person responsible is Arkady Yuryevich Volozh, a Kazakhstan-born Russian billionaire who lives in central Israel, keeping a low profile.

Volozh's wealth is estimated at $1.1 billion. He accumulated a substantial part of it in one of Russia's internationally best-known companies, one that has become associated with controversy as a result of the war in Ukraine, namely Yandex.

The company, founded by Volozh, is reckoned to be the fourth largest search engine in the world, competing with Google, and has thus gained the soubriquet ""the Russian Google"", but the company, estimated to be worth $7-8 billion (an estimate made after the start of the war) also competes with Amazon, Uber, and other technology giants, through complementary services such as groceries delivery, a taxi hailing app, and cloud services. In Russia, Yandex became one of the strongest and most visible brands in the big cities. How did Volozh get to Israel, and what is he looking for here?

An entrepreneur, not an oligarch

Volozh is not an oligarch, and finds the term distasteful. He is strict about presenting himself as an entrepreneur who has made his fortune in technology. Throughout his years of activity in Russia he adamantly refused to become connected with the regime, and avoided sectors associated with the Russian oligarchy such as oil, arms, and mining.

In 2008, at the same time as the Russian incursion into Georgia, Yandex started to prepare for an New York IPO, but the financial crisis that broke out that year delayed the move. Nevertheless, the intention to float the company aroused concern among senior people in the Russian government.

At that time, Yandex was the most popular news source in Russia, through a product that aggregated news stories from all the local outlets. In addition, it became an important player in the technology market, with its unique IP assets and its data on Russian users. The Russian regime feared that a flotation would expose the company to a hostile takeover. Under an agreement with the company, the Russian state was given, through its holding in local bank Sberbank, a golden share that in effect could block any foreign entity from gaining control of the company. In exchange, Yandex received almost complete freedom of action.

Nasdaq delisting

In March this year, Yandex and four other Russian technology companies had to delist from the Nasdaq exchange. Days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, trading in the company that represents Yandex outside of Russia (Netherlands-registered Yandex NV) was halted in New York and Frankfurt. At the same time, ""The Financial Times"" reported that Volozh's Internet giant had transferred to its servers in Russia data on millions of users of applications developed with software tools distributed to developers. In the report, experts expressed their fear that the information gathered could be made available to the Kremlin and could be used for surveillance, including of Ukrainians.

Yandex admitted that its software gathered data that was transferred to storage in Russia and Finland, but claimed that these were limited data not connected to specific users. The company added that identification of users on the basis of this information was a complicated process that even Yandex itself was not capable of carrying out. However, the affair made the Google of Russia's image controversial around the world.

EU sanctions

Last June, the EU imposed sanctions on the Russian billionaire, accusing him of ""materially or financially"" supporting Russia. The decision surprised Volozh and also the business community, since he claimed to have no connection with the Russian government, and had not lived in Russia for nearly a decade. Volozh argued that the EU had made a mistake, but quickly announced that he would step down as CEO of Yandex and as a director of the company.

The invasion of Ukraine was thus a turning point for Volozh. There were reports that Yandex's management was conducting negotiations on control of the international company in exchange for the transfer of parts of the business to a control group outside the Russian company. According to these reports, Volozh had decided to transfer part of Yandex's business outside Russia and to his management, and apparently this is currently being organized in Israel among other places.

Yandex NV has declared its intention of exiting the Russian market, and has commenced the process in order to distance itself from the hold of the Kremlin and its war in Ukraine. After the exit from Russia, the group will be left with four technology companies in AI, cloud, autonomous vehicles, and a technology education venture. The decision on the split will be in the hands of the shareholders in Yandex NV, among them several US investors.

Immigration to Israel

Following the Russian invasion a substantial part of Yandex's management came to Israel, as well as a group of developers and technology people. Volozh said at the time that this presented an opportunity for Israel, and he asked the Israeli government to assist in bringing in engineers from Russia, and some from Ukraine. He wrote to then minister of finance Avigdor Liberman and other ministers asking for help in completing the move, which in the end did not take place.

Volozh himself has visited Israel several times over the past twenty years, and told his associates that he was very impressed by the Israeli technology ecosystem. In 2010, he and Daniel Recanati invested $4.3 million in Face.com, founded by Gil Hirsch and Eden Shochat, which developed facial recognition technology. A year later, the company was sold to Facebook for an estimated $100 million.

This was the start of a long and significant connection to Israel for Volozh. In 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea, Volozh decided to focus on developing Yandex's international activity under the Netherlands company.

At that time, he decided to immigrate officially to Israel, and he received citizenship under the Law of Return. He met his wife Tosha here. The couple married in 2017 in Zichron Ya'akov, and they have three children. Volozh also has three children from a previous marriage.

These days, Volozh mainly spends his time advising the four startups located in Israel under Yandex, while Yandex's management continues to act to dissociate it from Russia. One of the companies, cloud services company Nebius, has been in the headlines in recent weeks as an Israeli attempt to compete with cloud giants Microsoft and Amazon.

Volozh makes few public appearances. He recently broke with this custom, and took part in a ""fireside chat"" with entrepreneur Yossi Vardi at the CyberTech Global Tel Aviv event. In the past few months, he has been very active in AI, and has held meetings with leaders of the sector in Israel. He also talks at conferences and meetings of the way Israel can develop independence in this strategically important field. In his few public comments, Volozh has expressed concern that Israel might not jump onto the AI bandwagon in time, and might be the last to adopt advanced services.

In closed conversations, he also expresses admiration for those in Israel's technology industry who have taken part in struggle against the judicial overhaul in Israel, and tells friends that, as someone who grew up in the Soviet Union, he is no less than thrilled by the campaign for democracy and by the way in which demonstrations can take place freely in the streets.","{'uri':
